{"text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday released  that focus on five key Covid-19 mitigation strategies: the universal and correct wearing of masks; physical distancing; washing hands; cleaning facilities and improving ventilation; and contact tracing, isolation and quarantine.Vaccines and testing are not among the \"key\" strategies the agency lays out, calling them \"additional layers\" of Covid-19 prevention.But the new recommendations come amid a national debate about when and how to reopen schools, even as fear of spreading the coronavirus continues and a push to prioritize teachers for vaccinations grows.\"I want to be clear, with this operational strategy, CDC is not mandating that schools reopen. These recommendations simply provide schools a long-needed roadmap for how to do so safely under different levels of disease in the community,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a news briefing on Friday.\"We also know that some schools are already providing in-person instruction and we want them to be able to continue to do this, but we know that some are not following the recommended mitigation strategies we know to work,\" Walensky said. \"For these schools, we are not mandating that they close; rather, we are providing these recommendations and highlighting the science behind them to help schools create an environment that is safe for schools, students, teachers and staff.\"Walensky added that while each strategy is important, CDC recommends \"prioritizing the first two\" -- wearing masks and physical distancing.\"These two strategies are incredibly important in areas that have high community spread of Covid-19, which right now is the vast majority of communities in the United States,\" Walensky said. The recommendations also emphasize keeping students in cohorts or \"pods\" to limit their contact with others and encourage physical distancing.The new recommendations also note that the risk of Covid-19 spread in a school can be associated with how much spread is in the surrounding community.\"I want to underscore that the safest way to open schools is to ensure that there is as little disease as possible in the community. We know that the introduction and subsequent transmission of Covid-19 in schools is connected to and facilitated by transmission of COVID-19 in the community,\" Walensky said on Friday.The CDC recommendations include a color-coded chart to describe levels of transmission from blue for low transmission, to yellow for moderate, to orange for substantial and then to red for high transmission.President Joe Biden said in a statement on Friday that the new CDC guidelines provide \"the best available scientific evidence\" on how to reopen schools safely, which remains one of his goals.\"We have sacrificed so much in the last year. But science tells us that if we support our children, educators, and communities with the resources they need, we can get kids back to school safely in more parts of the country sooner,\" Biden said in part. \"When my Secretary of Education is confirmed, I will task him with working alongside school administrators, educators, and parents to safely accelerate the process of school reopenings. As many states continue to follow the CDC's recommendation to prioritize teachers for vaccination, I urge all states to follow suit.\"Biden has said he will work to reopen most K-12 schools within his first 100 days in office but has stressed he will rely on health and medical experts to dictate the national guidance in order to reopen safely.\"It is a challenge to guarantee, or to say that our schools could open in 100 days -- because of the deep investments that need to be made around what it takes to get schools ready and prepared to reopen,\" Annette Anderson, a professor in the  and serves as deputy director for the new Center for Safe and Healthy Schools, told CNN on Friday.\"What I'm struck by is this notion that, even with the layered mitigation that they are suggesting is really an important strategy, that the CDC is not mandating that schools reopen -- that's a critical piece of this conversation because I think there was this expectation that after the 100 days, there was going to be some kind of opening that would mean all students would go back immediately,\" Anderson said. \"We now know that this is going to be a much more nuanced process, and it will take time,\" she added. \"I think we can be hopeful that if schools adopt these strategies and as they continue to gradually reopen, that by fall, we will see more of our students in the classrooms for face-to-face learning.\"In the new guidelines, the CDC does not list vaccination as a \"key\" strategy for opening schools, focusing instead of measures such as masks and physical distancing. Vaccinations for staff and teachers are \"an additional layer of protection,\" Walensky said.She added that the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that frontline essential workers  -- a group that includes educators -- be prioritized for Covid-19 vaccination.\"As such, we strongly encourage states to prioritize teachers and other school staff to get vaccinated,\" Walensky said. \"If we want our children to receive in-person instruction, we must ensure that teachers and school staff are healthy and protected from getting Covid-19 in places outside of schools where they might be at higher risk.\"Anderson said that vaccines are important to help rebuild trust with families, especially those who are skeptical that schools are ready to reopen.\"That's the work of our federal government right now, to help to convince families that they have provided the support for reopening, and that they have a tiered strategy that is going to help the schools to systematically follow a protocol that can be trusted,\" Anderson said. \"That was missing a year ago.\"Randi Weingarten, president of the  (AFT), called the CDC's new recommendations an \"informed\" and \"rigorous\" roadmap for the federation's members to use. Weingarten added that AFT remains supportive of widespread testing, which the guidance is \"instructive\" for, and noted that the guidance reinforces prioritizing vaccines for teachers and school staff.\"Of course, this set of safeguards should have been done 10 months ago—and the AFT released its plan recommending a suite of similar reopening measures in April. Instead, the previous administration meddled with the facts and stoked mass chaos and confusion. Now we have the chance for a rapid reset,\" Weingarten  on Friday.Several CDC officials have complained that the Trump White House interfered with guidance, even reviewing scientific documents. This new CDC guidance is based on science and free of political interference, Walensky said.\"I can assure you that this is free from political meddling,\" she told reporters on Friday.\"We have presented pieces of this scientific guidance to the White House so  that they would know what we are planning, but they have not reviewed my remarks,\" Walensky added.Walensky said Friday's guidelines were based on research, including data from the European Union, where more schools have reopened to in-person learning than in the United States, as well as from the few schools that have reopened in the US.\"The guidance is instructive for this moment in time, but this disease is not static,\" Walensky said in part. \"The stage is now set for Congress and the Education Department to make this guidance real -- and that means securing the funding to get this done in the nation's school districts and meet the social, emotional and academic needs of kids.\"Walensky on Friday said that the CDC grounded its new recommendations in science and \"the best available evidence.\" The agency also released a scientific brief to accompany its new strategies for schools. The brief includes references to CDC data and separate studies published in journals such as  and , as well as some pre-print research.A  posted on Friday notes, \"Based on the data available, in-person learning in schools has not been associated with substantial community transmission.\"Rather, \"when community rates of COVID-19 are high, there is an increased likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 will be introduced to, and potentially transmitted within, a school setting. Evidence to date suggests that when schools implement mitigation strategies with fidelity, transmission within schools can be limited,\" according to the scientific brief. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus that causes Covid-19.\"We have engaged with many education and public health partners to hear first-hand from parents and teachers directly about their experiences and concerns and have conducted an in-depth review of the available science and evidence to guide our recommendations,\" Walensky said. that some schools have managed to implement full or part-time in-person learning, without the kind of Covid-19 spread seen in crowded offices or long-term care facilities. Transmission has occurred, but CDC researchers say there is little evidence that it has contributed meaningfully to increased community spread.In one CDC study, mitigation measures, including social distancing, contact tracing and wearing masks -- provided to students through a grant from a private foundation -- helped 17 rural schools in Wisconsin achieve transmission rates that were 37% lower than those of the community at large. Of 191 Covid-19 cases, just 3.7% were contracted in school.Those mitigation measures can make a big difference. Another CDC study detailed how two Florida high school wrestling matches -- a high-contact sport that does not allow for masking or social distancing -- became superspreader events that led to the loss of an estimated 1,700 in-person school days.Overall, more research on the public health impacts of holding in-person learning during the pandemic remains needed, said Anderson of Johns Hopkins University.\"The challenge is that we've had so many stops and starts around what research to follow. ... We've heard research that suggests that schools are safe and kids are not super spreaders, and then you hear that because of the Covid-19 variants, maybe kids are super spreaders,\" Anderson said.\"The research will continue to come out and over time as we start to see more consistency in all of the research and the studies that are done, it will build up the confidence of families,\" she said. \"This is not a one and done. I think it's the beginning of a great rebound and response, but we have work to do and so we should focus on what we need to do between now and the reopening of schools in the fall so that we can have more consistency in strategy and planning, and measuring the outcomes.\"CNN's Kate Sullivan, Lauren Mascarenhas and Maggie Fox contributed to this report.", "summary": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday released guidelines for reopening schools that focus on five key Covid-19 mitigation strategies: the universal and correct wearing of masks; physical distancing; washing hands; cleaning facilities and improving ventilation; and contact tracing, isolation and quarantine."},
{"text": "Robin Davidson entered the lobby of Houston Methodist Hospital, where her 89-year-old father, Joe, was being treated for a flare-up of congestive heart failure.Before her stretched a line of people waiting to get Covid-19 vaccines. \"It was agonizing to know that I couldn't get in that line,\" said Davidson, 50, who is devoted to her father and usually cares for him full time. \"If I get sick, what would happen to him?\"Tens of thousands of middle-aged sons and daughters caring for older relatives with serious ailments but too young to qualify for a vaccine themselves are similarly terrified of becoming ill and wondering when they can get protected against the coronavirus.Like aides and other workers in nursing homes, these family caregivers routinely administer medications, monitor blood pressure, cook, clean and help relatives wash, get dressed and use the toilet, among many responsibilities. But they do so in apartments and homes, not in long-term care institutions — and they're not paid.\"In all but name, they're essential health care workers, taking care of patients who are very sick, many of whom are completely reliant upon them, some of whom are dying,\" said Katherine Ornstein, a caregiving expert and associate professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Mount Sinai's medical school in New York City. \"Yet, we don't recognize or support them as such, and that's a tragedy.\"The distinction is critically important because health care workers have been prioritized to get Covid-19 vaccines, along with vulnerable older adults in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. But family members caring for equally vulnerable seniors living in the community are grouped with the general population in most states and may not get vaccines for months.The exception: Older caregivers can qualify for vaccines by virtue of their age as states approve vaccines for adults ages 65, 70 or 75 and above. A few states have moved family caregivers into phase 1a of their vaccine rollouts, the top priority tier. Notably, South Carolina has done so for families caring for medically fragile children, and Illinois has given that designation to families caring for relatives of all ages with significant disabilities.Arizona is also trying to accommodate caregivers who accompany older residents to vaccination sites, Dr. Cara Christ, director of the state's Department of Health Services, said Monday during a Zoom briefing for President Joe Biden. Comprehensive data about which states are granting priority status to family caregivers is not available.Meanwhile, the Department of Veterans Affairs recently announced plans to offer vaccines to people participating in its Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. That initiative gives financial stipends to family members caring for veterans with serious injuries; 21,612 veterans are enrolled, including 2,310 age 65 or older, according to the VA. Family members can be vaccinated when the veterans they look after become eligible, a spokesperson said.\"The current pandemic has amplified the importance of our caregivers whom we recognize as valuable members of Veterans' health care teams,\" Dr. Richard Stone, VA acting undersecretary for health, said in the announcement.An estimated 53 million Americans are caregivers, according to a 2020 report. Nearly one-third spend 21 hours or more each week helping older adults and people with disabilities with personal care, household tasks and nursing-style care (giving injections, tending wounds, administering oxygen and more). An estimated 40% are providing high-intensity care, a measure of complicated, time-consuming caregiving demands.This is the group that should be getting vaccines, not caregivers who live at a distance or who don't provide direct, hands-on care, said Carol Levine, a senior fellow and former director of the Families and Health Care Project at the United Hospital Fund in New York City.Rosanne Corcoran, 53, is among them. Her 92-year-old mother, Rose, who has advanced dementia, lives with Corcoran and her family in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, on the second floor of their house. She hasn't come down the stairs in three years.\"I wouldn't be able to take her somewhere to get the vaccine. She doesn't have any stamina,\" said Corcoran, who arranges for doctors to make house calls when her mother needs attention. When she called their medical practice recently, an administrator said they didn't have access to the vaccine.Corcoran said she \"does everything for her mother,\" including bathing her, dressing her, feeding her, giving her medications, monitoring her medical needs and responding to her emotional needs. Before the pandemic, a companion came for five hours a day, offering some relief. But last March, Corcoran let the companion go and took on all her mother's care herself.Corcoran wishes she could get the vaccine sooner, rather than later. \"If I got sick, God forbid, my mother would wind up in a nursing home,\" she said. \"The thought of my mother having to leave here, where she knows she's safe and loved, and go to a place like that makes me sick to my stomach.\"Although Covid-19 cases are dropping in nursing homes and assisted living facilities as residents and staff members receive vaccines, 36% of deaths during the pandemic have occurred in these settings.Maggie Ornstein, 42, a caregiving expert who teaches at Sarah Lawrence College, has provided intensive care to her mother, Janet, since Janet experienced a devastating brain aneurism at age 49. For the past 20 years, her mother has lived with Ornstein and her family in Queens, New York.In a recent opinion piece, Ornstein urged New York officials to recognize family caregivers' contributions and reclassify them as essential workers. \"We're used to being abandoned by a system that should be helping us and our loved ones,\" she told me in a phone conversation. \"But the utter neglect of us during this pandemic — it's shocking.\"Ornstein estimated that if even a quarter of New York's 2.5 million family caregivers became ill with Covid-19 and unable to carry on, the state's nursing homes would be overwhelmed by applications from desperate families. \"We don't have the infrastructure for this, and yet we're pretending this problem just doesn't exist,\" she said.In Tomball, Texas, Robin Davidson's father was independent before the pandemic, but he began declining as he stopped going out and became more sedentary. For almost a year, Davidson has driven every day to his 11-acre ranch, 5 miles from where she lives, and spent hours tending to him and the property's upkeep.\"Every day, when I would come in, I would wonder was I careful enough (to avoid the virus)? Could I have picked something up at the store or getting gas? Am I going to be the reason that he dies? My constant proximity to him and my care for him is terrifying,\" she said.Since her father's hospitalization, Davidson's goal is to stabilize him so he can enroll in a clinical trial for congestive heart failure. Medications for that condition are no longer working for him, and fluid retention has become a major issue. He's now home on the ranch after spending more than a week in the hospital and he's gotten two doses of the vaccine — \"an indescribable relief,\" Davidson said.Out of the blue, she got a text from the Harris County Public Health department late last week, after putting herself on a vaccine waitlist. Vaccines were available, it read, and she quickly signed up and got a shot. Davidson ended up being eligible because she has two chronic medical conditions that raise her risk of Covid-19; Harris County doesn't officially recognize family caregivers in its vaccine allocation plan, a spokesperson said.

It exacerbates asthma and weakens defenses against , resulting in  and disrupted schooling and work. Climate change has already made pollen seasons in the United States and Canada worse, a new study of almost three decades' worth of data has revealed. The pollen seasons are getting longer and more intense.The amount of time people in North America are exposed to pollen as well as the amount of pollen had \"increased significantly\" in recent decades, according to the authors.The researchers looked at different pollen metrics between 1990 and 2018 from 60 monitoring stations across North America. Pollen seasons were starting up to 20 days earlier and lasting for up to eight days longer, the scientists found.There was also an increase in the pollen count or concentration of pollen, with a rise of 20.9% between 1990 and 2018 -- and a 21.5% increase for the spring season alone. \"There's an enormous body of research on how climate change is already affecting our health. Our study fills in a key piece connecting climate change to pollen, which is one of the largest drivers of asthma, allergies, and respiratory health problems,\" said William Anderegg, an assistant professor of biology at The University of Utah and lead author of the study that published in  on Monday.\"It's a clear example that climate change is here and now.\"The largest and most consistent increases were in Texas and the midwestern United States, the study found -- something that surprised Anderegg. He had expected to see larger pollen increase in more northern states. He said the reason for this wasn't \"entirely clear and is going to take more research to unravel. One hypothesis might be that the plant species that are found there are particularly sensitive to warming and producing more pollen.\"The study looked at different drivers for this change, including temperatures changes, rainfall, frost days and carbon dioxide concentrations, and it found that an increase in mean annual temperatures was the strongest driver.Using computer models of the Earth's climate, the researchers also calculated to what extent human-caused climate change had increased pollen concentrations and made pollen seasons longer. \"These computer models simulate a world without human-caused climate change and a world with human-caused climate change (i.e. the real world),\" Anderegg said via email. \"By combining the observed connection between pollen and temperature with these two different scenarios, we can estimate how much human-caused climate change is influencing pollen trends.\"The researchers concluded that it was a \"strong driver\" in terms of the earlier starts to the pollen season and longer season lengths. However, it was a more modest driver when it came to higher pollen concentrations.The contribution of human-made climate change was starker during the period 2003 to 2018 compared to the longer period of 1990 to 2018, the scientists said, which likely reflects both the cumulative effect of climate change and a larger number of pollen monitoring stations during the shorter period. The researchers also noted that the human environmental impact was more modest when looking at figures for an entire year versus the spring season, with some decreases in summer pollen counts indicating that the life cycles of some plant species had shifted.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some -- an allergic reaction to pollen, a fine powder from plants that can come into contact with your eyes, nose, mouth and throat.

The CDC guidance stresses five key mitigation strategies: requiring masks, physical distancing, handwashing, maintaining clean facilities and contract tracing. It also recommends different strategies based on how much transmission there is in the surrounding community, and has a color-coded guide with areas of high transmission colored red; substantial transmission colored orange; moderate transmission coded yellow and low transmission as blue.The CDC says school districts should re-assess weekly.If schools in \"high transmission\" communities cannot \"strictly implement all mitigation strategies,\" the CDC says all extracurricular activities should be virtual. Plus middle and high schools should stick with virtual learning in these red zones, and elementary schools should maximize physical distance through hybrid learning or reduced attendance. Fewer than 100,000 children in the US live in a county considered \"low\" or \"moderate transmission\" where the CDC recommends K-12 schools open for full in-person instruction. Most of those students live in Hawaii or Washington.The CNN analysis used the latest federal data on new case rates and test positivity rates, published Thursday by the US Health and Human Services Department, to determine each county's risk threshold according to CDC guidelines.

{"text": "As a third vaccine against Covid-19 stands ready to be evaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization, I feel the same awe and thrill that I did back in December when the first vaccine took that same consequential step. After reporting on the novel coronavirus for a little over a year and, having spoken to many of the prominent players involved in every aspect of research and public health, I think it's pretty safe to say that most people in the scientific community did not think it was likely that we would have a vaccine authorized by the end of 2020. Even people who are who are optimistic thought it would probably be 18 months to get to that point. Yet the country now has two authorized vaccines, one from Pfizer/BioNTech and another from Moderna, and this third one -- made by Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Biotech -- appears to be on the cusp of also getting the green light. By all accounts, that's pretty remarkable. As a result of the two authorized vaccines, there are now at least 34.7 million people in this country who have received their first dose, and more than 11.2 million who are fully vaccinated with both doses -- and all of these people are significantly less likely to become severely ill, require hospitalization or die of Covid-19. If the Johnson & Johnson vaccine becomes available, and we have no reason to think that it won't also be authorized, we'll have an important option that gives us, in addition to more vaccines, more flexibility: This one involves only one dose and is more easily transported and distributed because it doesn't have to be stored at the freezing temperatures required by the other two.Some people are concerned that this vaccine may not be as good as Pfizer's and Moderna's, both of which use new mRNA technology and have been shown to be approximately 95% protective against developing symptoms of Covid-19. In contrast, the J&J vaccine was shown to be 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial, according to the company. But when it comes to just severe disease, that number jumps up to 85%. And there were no hospitalizations or deaths among people who received the vaccine; this was measured from 28 days after the shot.Comparing the two figures, about 95% effective vs. 66% or 85% effective, may be misleading for two reasons. One is the J&J vaccine was tested later into the pandemic, when there was more circulating virus and after variants that are more easily transmissible were discovered. The other related reason is that the vaccine was tested in those very countries -- including Brazil and South Africa -- where some of those variants were already in wide circulation in certain areas. It's unknown whether the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines would have fared any better under the same circumstances.In fact, the efficacy of the J&J vaccine against moderate and severe disease, measured one month after the shot, varied from 72% in the US, to 66% in Latin America, to 57% in South Africa.  No matter which of the J&J outcome numbers you look at, they're still higher than the 50% effectiveness threshold that the US Food and Drug Administration set as a target for authorization last summer. And the 72% efficacy seen in the United States is in the range of what Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had said he was hoping for, before any of the vaccine trial results were known. By way of comparison, 66% effectiveness at lowering risk is better than the average 40%-60% range for the flu vaccine. Yet public health experts ask Americans to get a flu vaccine every year. That's because even when the flu vaccine isn't that effective, it still prevents hospitalizations and saves lives. For example, during the 2019-2020 flu season, when the vaccine was determined to be only 39% effective, it prevented an estimated 7.5 million cases of the flu, 3.7 million flu-related doctor visits, 105,000 flu-related hospitalizations, and 6,300 flu-related deaths, according to the CDC. Perhaps most important of all, the J&J vaccine was 85% effective overall at doing what we care about most: preventing hospitalizations and deaths.  Think about it: If you take the more than 57,000 vaccinated participants from all three of these vaccine trials -- Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and J&J -- there were no deaths reported.  And all but a very small number of the severe cases and hospitalizations were in the placebo group.To understand what that means, if you took a sample of 57,000 Americans 18 years and older, Covid-19 would have sent almost 190 to the hospital and killed more than 100 of them.As Fauci said during a call with reporters a couple of weeks ago, \"If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress and human suffering and death.\"  He pointed out that it will also reduce the stress on the US health care system. In addition to reducing the risk of developing severe Covid-19, there are tantalizing hints that at least some of the vaccines appear to also prevent people from getting infected and, by extension, transmitting it to others -- although that has yet to be proven. This is important, because viral transmission by asymptomatic people is one of the main ways the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads so easily. A pre-print study  out of Israel that has neither been published nor peer-reviewed found that the Pfizer vaccine reduced viral load four-fold in infections that occurred between doses. People with lower viral loads are thought to be less infectious.  Another study, not yet published, from the University of Oxford, found that the AstraZeneca vaccine -- which is still being tested and is not available in the US, but is being used in other countries -- found that the rate of positive tests declined by about half after two doses. If the vaccine were simply making infections milder, the authors argued, the positivity rate would not change.Another big area of speculation is whether any of the vaccines work well against the variants that are emerging around the globe. While these variants have not established themselves in this country (the CDC reports approximately 997 cases in the US, the vast majority (981) of which are caused by the variant first identified in the United Kingdom), some public health experts warn it's only a matter of time before they become dominant. Preliminary studies on the Pfizer  and Moderna vaccines found that both appear to work as well on the variants first identified in the UK and a little less well against the variant first identified in South Africa. Now, both vaccine makers are exploring booster shots out of an abundance of caution. In contrast, the AstraZeneca vaccine was found to provide only \"minimal protection\" against mild and moderate Covid-19 from the variant first identified in South Africa, causing that country to pause its rollout of that vaccine, at least for now.With variants beginning to gain traction here, it's a race against time between their spread and how quickly we can vaccinate the population. Fauci said about 70% to 85% of the US population will need to be fully vaccinated before the country can begin to return to a sense of normalcy but variants will make the job harder. \"The best way to avoid that, is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible, because viruses don't mutate if they don't replicate,\" he said last week.While we are nowhere near that 70% to 85% range, the pace of vaccination is picking up. The country is averaging around 1.6 million vaccinations a day. Nationally, about 1 in 10 people has been vaccinated, with 16 states topping the 10% mark, according to new CDC figures.  To speed up the process, the Biden administration this week is starting to ship vaccines to local pharmacies, including CVS, Walgreens and Walmart, under the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. Most people are familiar with their local pharmacies, and while there aren't going to be enough doses right away, the plan is to make it easier to get an appointment and easier to get to it, as the pace picks up. And starting next week, vaccines will also be sent nationwide to 250 community health centers, which serve vulnerable populations.But now is not the time to let our guard down. While we are getting mostly positive news about vaccines, and the number of Covid-19 cases is going down, we're still very much in this pandemic and things can change rapidly, especially when it comes to the effect the variants will have on both vaccine efficacy and the number of new infections. So until we know more, including whether vaccines reduce transmission in addition to reducing severe disease, we have to keep doing the things we know will keep us safe: wear a mask, keep our physical distance, stay in well-ventilated areas -- and if you get the chance, get your shot.

The disease puts them at an increased risk for severe illness if they get Covid-19.\"One of the first things my dad ever told me when I was diagnosed was that I was going to have to fight for myself and my health my whole life,\" McCulloch told CNN. \"So when I walked in and was able to get the vaccine ... I felt such a sense of relief.\"About two months have passed since the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines were authorized for emergency use in the United States and states began to administer doses, vaccinating  first.Since then, many states have moved on to vaccinate the next prioritized groups, such as other essential workers, older adults and -- most recently -- people with comorbidities or underlying medical conditions that put them at an increased risk, such as diabetes.\"At the end of the day,  are among those with diabetes, not just type 1, but type 2 as well,\" said McCulloch, a project manager at the American Diabetes Association. Although, according to the association, diabetes affects just .But the move to vaccinate people with diabetes and other certain conditions has not been uniform nationwide. In some states, people with comorbidities are not eligible to receive the vaccine yet -- and in states where they are eligible, there's variation on what conditions make someone eligible for a vaccine, and whether paperwork is required to confirm that condition.Most of the states that are vaccinating people ages 16 to 64 with certain comorbidities are defining the eligible conditions by t on which conditions are associated with an increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19 infection. The CDC notes that adults of any age with the following underlying conditions are at an increased risk of severe Covid-19: cancer, chronic kidney disease, COPD, Down syndrome, heart conditions, obesity and severe obesity, sickle cell disease, smoking, and type 2 diabetes. The list also includes people with a weakened immune system from solid organ transplantation and pregnancy.Some states include just some of those conditions on its list of eligible conditions, while others may require that a person lives with two or more of those conditions to be eligible.In , for instance, having two or more conditions qualifies you for the vaccine under Phase 1b, if your conditions are verified by a medical professional, but having just one condition puts you into Phase 3A, which has not started yet. In , those with a developmental or intellectual disability plus certain congenital, developmental or early onset and inherited conditions are eligible for vaccination, according to the state's Department of Health website.The state of Colorado, where McCulloch lives, has not started vaccinating people with certain comorbidities or underlying health conditions, such as cancer, heart conditions or diabetes.McCulloch was able to receive a first dose of the Moderna vaccine because a local pharmacist who vaccinated McCulloch's mother mentioned that the pharmacy had some extra doses of vaccine that it needed to administer quickly. Otherwise, the doses would expire and could not be used.\"They had asked her if she had anyone that she knew that was living with diabetes, heart disease, all of those things -- and she actually said that her husband and her two daughters were both living with diabetes,\" McCulloch said. \"So I was able to go.\"When McCulloch arrived at the pharmacy to receive the vaccine, the pharmacist asked for proof that McCulloch lives with diabetes. McCulloch said that she showed the pharmacist a glucose-monitoring sensor on her arm, some of her medical data that she tracks on an app and her health insurance information.\"Just being in the right place at the right time, I was able to kind of jump in line and grab my first dose,\" McCulloch said. She is due for her second dose on February 15.\"I recognize that I have a very privileged stance, because of the way that the rollout was done, and due to my mom being a special education teacher,\" McCulloch said.\"For example, my dad and my twin sister have not gotten their vaccine quite yet,\" she said. \"That's part of the problem right now -- is that states' rules vary so greatly, and at the end of the day, people with comorbidities, they deserve to receive the vaccine just as much as other people.\"People with certain comorbidities and underlying conditions currently are eligible to sign up for Covid-19 vaccinations in nearly a dozen states: , , , , , , , , ,  and , according to a CNN analysis of public health department websites.Some of those states have started vaccinating this group while others are only starting pre-registration. Within a state, it might vary county by county.In a couple of other states, vaccinations are set to start soon this month.In New York, people with comorbidities and underlying conditions can  and vaccines are expected to begin for this group on Monday.\"As the state's effort to vaccinate health care workers nears completion this week, we are now shifting those doses to prioritize those New Yorkers with comorbidities and pre-existing conditions - a group which has felt the brunt of COVID's destructiveness first-hand,\" New York Gov. Andrew  this week. In Illinois, the state plans to  to include people with comorbidities, underlying conditions and disabilities. On Wednesday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a news release, \"As quickly as we receive enough vaccine supply, we need to waste no time in protecting a broader section of our most vulnerable population.\"But how individuals confirm their underlying conditions is different from place to place. In some states, such as New York and New Mexico, documentation is required at vaccination appointments to prove that you have an underlying medical condition. For instance, New Yorkers must provide either a doctor's note, medical records or signed certification.In New Mexico, , \"Individuals should be prepared to verify medically qualifying conditions. To do so, individuals may provide a note from a provider, emergency department or hospital discharge summary, prescription bottle, prescription, or other form of validation.\" In some other states, such as New Jersey, Texas and Virginia, no documentation is required. Lara Anton, a spokesperson at the Texas Department of State Health Services told CNN in an email on Thursday, \"We don't want to create barriers that would prevent people from getting vaccinated. To confirm chronic medical conditions, providers should refer to the person's medical history. If a provider doesn't have access to the person's medical history, the person can self-disclose their qualifying medical condition. They do not need to provide documents to prove that they qualify.\"Each state is different \"and some of these vaccine registration processes are going to be on the honor system,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, known as NACCHO.As someone living with high blood pressure, Freeman said that she pre-registered for a vaccine on an online waitlist in her community of Prince William County, Virginia, in the category of underlying health conditions. Covid-19 vaccines will be administered to that priority group once the county moves into its next vaccination phase.\"In the case of my own jurisdiction, the preregistration for those with underlying conditions is based on an honor system to tell you truth,\" she said. \"I did not have to provide proof of medication, a diagnosis of the underlying condition, or anything like that.\" Freeman said that there are various ways residents might learn about their eligibility for a Covid-19 vaccine, such as through their local health department, community organizations or the faith community.McCulloch, who has received her first dose in Colorado, certainly looks forward to when her twin sister and father will be eligible to get vaccinated in their communities.\"I believe in health care, and I believe in science,\" McCulloch said. \"This is critical for the health and safety of our population.\"CNN's Ashley Ahn contributed to this report.", "summary": "To fight Covid-19, many states have have moved to vaccinate the next prioritized groups, such as other essential workers, older adults and -- most recently -- people with comorbidities or underlying medical conditions that put them at an increased risk."},
{"text": "Covid-19 cases continued to decline over the last four weeks, with the seven-day average down nearly 20% from the week before, meaning we may have passed the peak in the winter surge. But don't let the positive sound of that trend fool you. The number of new cases are still \"dramatically higher\" than last summer's peak, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Monday.And while an  published Tuesday found that Americans' perception of risk from the coronavirus is the lowest it has been in months, experts say you definitely should not toss your mask away and jump on a plane to see your mom just yet. But understanding what the rest of the year will bring depends on who you ask. Some experts are embracing optimism, and others are bracing for a storm.Many say it's too soon to know. All are concerned about the new variants. And they hope that you will do your part to keep the number of variants from growing. \"Despite the trends moving in the right direction, we remain in a very serious situation,\" Walensky said at a White House briefing on the coronavirus Monday. \"Covid-19 continues to infect too many people.\"Walensky warned that the spread of variants is \"a threat that could reverse the recent positive trends we are seeing.\"Viruses change as they spread, and with so many cases worldwide, the coronavirus has had a lot of opportunities. Some changes are harmless. Others make it more contagious. That's what happened with the variant first detected in the UK. Its ability to transmit is such a concern that some experts like Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, describe the coming surge as a \"hurricane.\" This, he says, is the eye of the storm.Hotez told CNN Tuesday that the new variants first found in the UK, South Africa and Brazil can upend what currently appears to be positive trends.\"Everything is going in the right direction. The numbers are going down. We're starting to rev up in terms of vaccinations. Everything is looking really promising. Unfortunately, we have these spike variants that seem to be mounting and that really worries me,\" Hotez said.  Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm called the variant threat a \"category five hurricane,\" and warns the country has not seen the end to new case records.\"The surge that is likely to occur with this new variant from England is going to happen in the next six to fourteen weeks,\" Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said on NBC's Meet the Press at the  \"If we see that happen, which my 45 years in the trenches tells me we will, we are going to see something like we have not seen yet, in this country.\"Even with vaccinations underway, more cases could bring more hospitalizations and deaths.And while it hasn't happened yet, experts worry the virus could mutate in such a way that tests, vaccines, and antibody treatments sensitive to the original coronavirus will stop working. More research is needed, but so far, there are indications from vaccine and antibody treatment trials that they still work against the variants, although some may not work as well. Vaccine makers are already looking at ways to adapt them, if necessary.Variants are one reason Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, wants you to get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn.  \"You need to get vaccinated when it becomes available as quickly and as expeditiously as possible,\" Fauci said in a news briefing with the White House Covid-19 response team. \"Viruses cannot mutate if they don't replicate. And if you stop their replication by vaccinating widely and not giving the virus an open playing field to continue to respond to the pressures that you put on it, you will not get mutations.\"Still other experts are more optimistic that the country will get ahead of the variants. Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said on CBS Sunday that cases should level off, even if the variants cause \"localized hotspots.\" Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University, said that the country is in a \"much better spot\" today than it was three weeks ago. \"Cases are falling and the optimism and the kind of outlook for the future is very bright, once we get into May and June,\" Jha said. \"The next couple months may end up being pretty tough.\"Jha said the \"issue\" that could determine the future of how the country experiences the pandemic will be how it handles the variant. It has potential to cause the problems Osterholm warned about, Jha said; however, if people have a short-term strategy to manage it and stay vigilant, \"things are going to get much, much better.\"Dr. Claudia Hoyen, an infectious disease specialist at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center thinks with the variants and the slow vaccine rollout, it's too early to know what the future of the pandemic will look like.In the immediate term, Hoyen said she's pretty sure that things will look a lot like they have for awhile. You will still be wearing masks for the foreseeable future and you shouldn't be dining indoors on Valentine's Day.\"We're going to learn more every day,\" Hoyen said. \"I know that isn't something that people want to hear, because it isn't something I want to say. I'd love to be able to say by March it's going to look like this, and then by June it's going to look like that, but unfortunately, there are still so many moving pieces in this puzzle. Every time we think we get to a place where we know what to expect then something else happens.\"Hoyen said she understands people's frustration.\"But they also have to understand that this is truly like nothing we've ever seen before and it's so rapidly changing that, you know, you just really need to try as best as you can to stay one step ahead of that,\" Hoyen said. To stay a step ahead, you know the drill. Maintain physical distance. Wear a good mask. Wash your hands. Avoid crowds. \"We have to be patient,\" Hoyen said.\"It's hard, really hard. We're humans, we like each other. But we still have to keep our guard up. You don't want to be that person that created another variant and you want to stay safe.\"  \"Ultimately, what we want is for all of us to get through this together, so that, by maybe this coming Christmas, hopefully things will be looking better and we're able to celebrate with everyone that is here today.\"", "summary": "Covid-19 cases continued to decline over the last four weeks, with the seven-day average down nearly 20% from the week before, meaning we may have passed the peak in the winter surge.

More doses should be available daily by then, he said. And he said he was \"fairly certain\" that toward the end of April, pharmacies, community vaccine centers and mobile units will help pick up the pace -- and not just for those in higher priority groups.\"I would imagine by the time we get to April, that will be what I would call for, you know, for better wording, open season,\" Fauci said. \"Namely, virtually everybody and anybody in any category could start to get vaccinated.\" Fauci told  on Thursday that vaccines could be authorized for young children by September. Pfizer and Moderna, the two companies currently with authorized Covid-19 vaccines in the US, have both begun trials for children -- but have started with older age groups.Pfizer's trial in children ages 12-15 is fully enrolled with 2,259 participants. The company said it hopes to have results \"in the early part of 2021 and from there, we will plan to finalize our study in 5-11 year olds.\"Moderna is still enrolling participants in its trial in children ages 12-18, and has plans to start studying its vaccine on even younger children between 6 months and 11 years old.\"I would think by the time we get to school opening, we likely will be able to get people who come into the first grade,\" Fauci told ProPublica.Fauci has previously said that Americans had a chance of living a little more normally by early fall,  70% to 85% of the US population was vaccinated by end of summer.His comments Thursday came as some states have complained . States initially raced to vaccinate priority populations -- often health care workers and people in long-term care facilities -- followed by seniors and/or essential workers.More than 34.7 million people in the US had received at least their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as of Thursday morning, , while more than 11.1 million people have received two doses. The average daily rate of Covid-19 vaccine administration in the US has been steadily increasing each week since Over the past seven days, the average number of doses administered each day was close to 1.6 million, according to a CNN analysis of data published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have indicated their weekly output should pick up. Pfizer, which said it supplied 20 million doses to the US by January 31,expects to deliver 200 million total doses by the end of May,with more later.Moderna, which supplied 30.4 million by January 26, has said it expects to have delivered 100 million total doses by the end of March, with more later.President Joe Biden said Thursday the US is on track to have vaccine supply for 300 million Americans \"by the end of July.\" \"Within three weeks, 'round the clock work with so many people standing behind me and in front of me, we've now purchased enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all Americans, and now we're working to get those vaccines into the arms of millions of people,\" Biden Biden also announced that the US has purchased additional Moderna and Pfizer vaccine.And  would add to the country's supply if the Food and Drug Administration authorizes its one-dose candidate.The company has said it could provide 20 million to 30 million doses by the end of April if the authorization comes.Meanwhile,  and some experts have suggested pharmacies eventually could administer 100 million doses a month, assuming adequate supply.

Easing restrictions now is \"incredibly risky,\" Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"It is absolutely essential that we continue to do steps beyond vaccination to keep this under control,\" Besser said. \"The more this virus is allowed to spread in our communities, the more we're going to see these variants spreading.\"The CDC has said a more transmissible variant first identified in the United Kingdom could be dominant in the US in March, and could worsen virus spread.For now, however, the rates of new Covid-19 cases and deaths, and the numbers of Covid-19 patients in hospitals, are dropping after holiday-era surges:-- Cases: The US has averaged 104,304 new Covid-19 cases a day over the last week -- down 58% since the country's peak average of more than 249,800 on January 8, according to Johns Hopkins University data. -- Hospitalizations: More than 76,900 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals on Wednesday -- the lowest total since November 16, according to the COVID Tracking Project.

Tocilizumab was added to the trial in April 2020. The results were shared in , but have not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal.For the trial, 2,022 patients were randomly allocated tocilizumab and compared with 2,094 patients who received standard care.  \"There were 596 deaths amongst the people in the tocilizumab group, 29%, and there were 694 deaths, 33%, in the usual care group. So that is a reduction in the risk of deaths of around about a sixth or a seventh,\" Martin Landray, professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford, and deputy chief investigator of the RECOVERY trial, said during a briefing on Thursday.  \"An absolute difference of four in a hundred,\" Landray said. \"You need to treat about 25 patients in order to save one patient, one life.\"  Landray said that the benefits were consistent in every group of patients studied. The drug was also shown to have a benefit for people who were not on mechanical ventilation at the start of the trial; the risk of progressing to mechanical ventilation or death reducing from 38% to 33%.  The treatment's benefits were in addition to those from steroids such as dexamethasone -- 82% of patients were receiving one of these steroids.  \"The data suggest that in Covid-19 patients with hypoxia (requiring oxygen) and significant inflammation, treatment with the combination of systemic corticosteroid (such as dexamethasone) plus tocilizumab reduces mortality by about one third for patients requiring simple oxygen and nearly one half for those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation,\" said a press release from the University of Oxford. \"This is a treatment, just in summary, that reduces mortality, shortens hospital stay and reduces the chances of people needing invasive mechanical ventilators,\" Landray said. \"That's good for patients, that's good for the health service.

{"text": "Double masking can significantly improve protection, new data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows.Researchers found that layering a cloth mask over a medical procedural mask, such as a disposable blue surgical mask, can block 92.5% of potentially infectious particles from escaping by creating a tighter fit and eliminating leakage.\"These experimental data reinforce CDC's prior guidance that everyone 2 years of age or older should wear a mask when in public and around others in the home not living with you,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, told a White House briefing.\"We continue to recommend that masks should have two or more layers, completely cover your nose and mouth, and fit snugly against your nose and the sides of your face,\" said WalenskyMedical procedure masks like the commonly seen blue surgical masks typically don't fit securely to faces and create gaps, allowing unfiltered air to escape. A fitted cloth mask can act as a cinch and secures the loose medical mask in place. This improves protection by preventing leakage of unfiltered air and particles, better protecting the wearer and those around them. Beginning in January 2021, the CDC tested two simple modifications to improve the performance of commonly used masks by using the \"double masking\" and \"knotting\" methods. The study found that 'knotting' can improve the overall performance of medical procedure masks. By folding mask edges inward and knotting ear loop strings where they meet mask fabric, the excess fabric is flattened and reduces the gap on either side of the face.A knotted medical mask can block 63% of particles that could contain coronavirus  from escaping, a significant improvement from blocking only 42% of particles when unknotted, according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published Wednesday.The study also found that when both an infected and uninfected source were wearing double masks, the cumulative exposure from potentially infectious aerosols of of the uninfected person was reduced by 96.4%. When both people wore knotted and tucked masks alone, the cumulative exposure was reduced by 95.9%.Both findings highlight the importance of a good fit to maximize mask performance and reduce exposure.The CDC team used a medical procedure mask, and a three-layered cloth mask for a total of 12 different mask combinations. They performed tests using various combinations of no mask, double masks, and unknotted or knotted and tucked medical procedure masks. They did not test N95 respirators.When studying 'double masking' these experiments used one cloth mask over a medical mask. The researchers did not include any other combinations of masks, such as cloth over cloth, medical procedure mask over medical procedure mask, or medical procedure mask over cloth.\"I want to be clear that these new scientific data released today do not change the specific recommendations about who should wear a mask, or when they should wear one. But they do provide new information on why wearing a well-fitting mask is so important to protect you and others,\"  said Walensky. \"Based on this new information, the CDC is  for the public on the CDC website to provide new options on how to improve mask fit.\"Some may see the new CDC research efforts as the first tepid acknowledgement from the federal government that the public needs higher quality masks, that  and  have been calling for.An poll found an all-time high of 72% of Americans say they wear a mask at all times, but some Americans have expressed frustration at the evolving mask guidance responding to the novel coronavirus. Experts point out that 'novel' means new, and as scientists and health officials learn more, recommendations may change.Dr. John Brooks, chief medical officer of the CDC's Covid-19 response, who worked on the study, described the findings as \"new information for consumers to help them really take control of their risk.\" \"If you're going to wear a mask, consider what you can do to make sure that it fits well to improve its performance,\" Brooks told CNN.Masks became an important part of the coronavirus response when it was discovered that the virus could be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers. It was initially a scramble to get people wearing masks last spring, and some experts have spent the last year conducting studies proving masks could prevent the spread of coronavirus. Now that it is known how well masks work, the next step is making them work better, according to Brooks.\"We've never had to think about regulating cloth masks,\" Brooks told CNN.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday there's no formal recommendation that people wear two masks, but is considering a \"range of options\" when it comes to getting masks to Americans,. Psaki told reporters during a news briefing that reports that two masks protect better than one were based on a \"study, which was a reflection of the importance of well-fitting masks, something that many of our health and medical experts have talked about.\"  \"It doesn't actually issue definitive guidance on one mask versus two mask,\" Psaki said. \"Obviously if that's something they were to issue as official guidance, we listened to our health and medical experts.\"  She said the study shows \"that if a person has a loose fitting mask that they should consider options to improve that fit.\"There are also efforts in the works to create the first US consumer mask standards. ASTM International, an international technical standards organization, and the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, are working on standards help Americans tell which masks actually work, The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory is a part of the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).Brooks indicated that the CDC would encourage or recommend the ASTM standards, but didn't believe the CDC would require them to avoid \"creating barriers.\" He does believe having a consumer mask standard in place could move the manufacturing market in the right direction, which is ultimately what is needed to ensure consumer protection.\"An ASTM approval that you've met their standard, we hope, will push the industry in the direction of being sure they focus on producing masks that actually do what they're supposed to.\"", "summary": "Double masking can stop nearly all of infectious particles from escaping, a CDC study finds."},
{"text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week is set to release highly anticipated new guidance for getting children physically back to school during the coronavirus pandemic.The Biden administration is pushing to reopen schools, an issue some view as being tied to the reopening of the economy and a return to normal life in America. An administration official told CNN the CDC's five key strategies to reopening schools include hand washing, masking, social distancing, cleaning and ventilation, as well as contact tracing, isolation and quarantine.  The guidance will not suggest requiring staffers to be vaccinated, instead describing vaccination as another strategy to \"layer,\" since many schools were able to safely reopen before vaccines were available, the official noted.  The guidelines will also note that screening -- testing people to catch asymptomatic cases or people who are infected but have not yet become ill -- can improve detection of cases.But some teachers and unions are pushing back against plans to reopen, many with demands for vaccination and more supplies.The National Education Association (NEA) surveyed 3,305 of its members and said Tuesday that 82% have yet to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. As of Monday, at least 26 states and Washington DC said they would allow some or all teachers and school staff to get a Covid-19 vaccine. Some have also raised concerns about equity, noting that current access to the funding and supplies needed to meet safe reopening standards is often skewed towards wealthier jurisdictions.\"Most schools, especially those attended by Black, brown, indigenous, and poor White students have severely outdated ventilation systems and no testing or tracing programs to speak of,\" NEA President Becky Pringle said.Pringle noted that messaging from the CDC and other leaders carries weight and hopes the new guidance will be backed by funding from federal and local entities\"We need to ensure that we have the additional funds to help our more marginalized students and schools, because we're digging out of a hole here,\" said Pringle. \"Here we are with outdated ventilation systems -- sick buildings -- that we want to send kids back into with the coronavirus still raging.\"President Joe Biden's Covid-19 relief proposal would include $170 billion for K-12 schools, colleges and universities that could be directed toward mitigation measures.Experts say that with the right precautions, a return to in-person learning can be safe -- even before all teachers and staff are vaccinated.\"School should be the last places closed and the first places open,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a White House briefing last week. \"Our goal is to make sure in getting children back to school that we do so both with the safety of the children and the safety of the teachers.\" Walensky previously said that vaccinating teachers \"is not a prerequisite for safe reopening of schools.\"Some schools have managed to implement full or part-time in-person learning, without the kind of Covid-19 spread seen in crowded offices or long-term care facilities. Transmission has occurred, but there is little evidence that it has contributed meaningfully to increased community spread.In one CDC study, mitigation measures, including social distancing, contact tracing and wearing masks -- provided to students through a grant from a private foundation -- helped 17 rural schools in Wisconsin achieve transmission rates that were 37% lower than those of the community at large. Of 191 Covid-19 cases, just 3.7% were contracted in school.Those mitigation measures can make a big difference. Another CDC study detailed how two Florida high school wrestling matches -- a high-contact sport that does not allow for masking or social distancing -- became superspreader events that led to the loss of an estimated 1,700 in-person school days.After Covid-19 began to take hold throughout the US, the CDC offered some considerations for closing schools in March last year, noting that suspending in-person learning for eight weeks or more would likely have more of an impact on mitigating community spread than shorter closures in response to positive cases. Some schools switched to virtual learning for the remainder of the academic year. Ahead of the new school year in August, the CDC advised communities to weigh the benefits of in-person learning against the risks of reopening schools in the midst of a pandemic. The agency advised jurisdictions to make decisions about in-person learning based on their level of community spread.For schools allowing in-person learning, the CDC emphasized the importance of maintaining a clean environment, wearing masks and social distancing. Schools were told they should try to keep students and teachers in distinct groups throughout the day and have lunchtime outside, when possible. Experts have warned that learning during a pandemic can be hard on students. The agency advised schools to maintain mental health services and offer remote counseling.In the months since, schools have adopted varying approaches that include in-person learning, online learning and a hybrid of the two.Staying on top of transmission rates -- and perhaps the presence of virus variants -- will help people manage anxiety and make informed plans about reopening schools, said Dr. Stuart Ray, a Johns Hopkins University professor of medicine in infectious diseases. Dashboards and other tools to aid in data collection can help jurisdictions stay informed.Testing will also be a valuable tool, Ray noted. \"It does make a big difference to do some testing and not just symptom-based screening, particularly when children are less likely to be symptomatic than adults,\" he said.As for teachers and school staff, Ray said there's no doubt that there is some level of risk involved with a return to in-person learning before everyone has been vaccinated, but tools like personal protective equipment can help make everyone safer.\"We need some guidance about how to factor in effective PPE, so that people who are not vaccinated can still be safe -- as we demonstrated health care workers could be in 2020, before a vaccine was available,\" he said.One of the most effective ways people can help make teachers, staff and students safer inside schools is by helping to control the spread of the virus outside of schools, Ray said.\"If people are really careful about masking and distancing outside of schools, then the schools become safer,\" he said.CNN's Ben Tinker, Jen Christensen, Jacqueline Howard and Meridith Edwards contributed to this report.", "summary": "The CDC is set to release highly anticipated new guidance for getting children physically back to school during the coronavirus pandemic this week."},
{"text": "A variant suspected of helping fuel a surge of coronavirus in Brazil's Amazon region . Another that's been worrying officials in South Africa pops up in two places in South Carolina and, just days later, in Maryland.Scientists are not surprised to see the coronavirus changing and evolving -- it's what viruses do, after all. And with so much unchecked spread across the US and other parts of the world, the virus is getting plenty of opportunity to do just that.Four of the new variants are especially worrisome.\"The variants that have been identified recently seem to spread more easily. They're more transmissible, which can lead to increased number of cases, and increased stress on our already overtaxed system,\" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the newly appointed director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a briefing Wednesday.What scientists most fear is that one will mutate to the point that it causes more severe disease, bypasses the ability of tests to detect it or evades the protection provided by vaccination. While some of the new variants appear to have changes that look like they could affect immune response, it's only by a matter of degree.Governments are already reacting. Colombia banned flights from Brazil, and Brazil banned flights from South Africa. It's almost certainly too late to stop the spread, and there's some indication the mutations in these variants are arising independently and in multiple places. Here's what's known about the top four.At the top of the list for researchers in the US is the B.1.1.7 variant first seen in Britain. The CDC has warned it could worsen the spread of the pandemic. It reports more than 300 cases in 28 states -- but those are only the cases caught by genomic sequencing, which is hit and miss in the US.Although hearing about mutant new viruses can frighten people, scientists say they are reassured by what they have found: The human immune system can handle the variants that have sprung up so far, especially B.1.1.7.\"As far as we know it is transmitted in exactly the same way,\" Gregory Armstrong, who directs the Office of Advanced Molecular Detection at CDC, told CNN.That means the same measures already known to reduce spread will also stop the new variants: mask use, social distancing, avoiding large groups or crowds and frequent handwashing.However, the mutations in the variant help it enter cells more easily -- which means if someone, says, breathes in a lungful of air that has virus particles in it, those particles are going to be more likely to infect some cells in the sinuses or lungs rather than bouncing off harmlessly. The worrisome changes enhance the spike protein that the virus uses to attach to cells, meaning people are more likely to become infected by an exposure.So people need to try harder to prevent spread until vaccination can be sped up.\"In order to interrupt transmission, we are going to need higher rates of what we do to slow transmission,\" Armstrong said. \"We are going to need to pay more attention to wearing masks. And we will need to increase vaccine coverage.\"There have been some confusing reports about whether B.1.1.7 has caused more severe disease in Britain.\"The most recent data indicate from the UK that it appears to be a bit more virulent in the sense of potentially causing more serious disease,\"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci told a webcast Thursday sponsored by the National Education Association.The variant first seen in South Africa called B.1.351 or 501Y.V2 was reported for the first time in the US Thursday, in South Carolina. On Saturday, Maryland's governor announced a sample from someone in the Baltimore area had also shown the characteristic mutation pattern of B.1.351.None of the three people had any contact with one another and none had traveled recently. This suggests the variant has been spreading undetected in the communities.It's been seen in more than 30 other countries, according to the World Health Organization.\"The variant which was first detected in South Africa has spread quickly beyond Africa and so what's keeping me awake at night right now is that it's very likely circulating in a number of African countries,\" Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said Thursday.It has a different pattern of mutations that causes more physical alterations in the structure of the spike protein than B.1.1.7 does. One important mutation, called E484K, appears to affect the receptor binding domain -- the part of the spike protein most important for attaching to cells.It could help the virus partly escape the effects of vaccines. \"There is more concern about immune escape,\" Armstrong said. Vaccine makers and academic researchers are testing samples of this variant, along with others, to see if it can evade the immune response caused by vaccination.Fauci says even so, there's an extra cushion of immunity caused by vaccination. It gives some wiggle room. \"The good news is the vaccines as they exist now still would be effective against the mutants. The sobering news ... as you get more and more replication, you can get more and more of evolution of mutants, which means you always got to be a step ahead of it,\" Fauci told CNN on Monday.Teams at Columbia University, the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University and elsewhere have also been testing lab-made versions of the viral mutations against the blood of vaccinated people and say while there does seem to be a somewhat diminished effect of vaccination, its not enough to weaken protection -- yet.But Maryland-based vaccine maker Novavax released preliminary results of its coronavirus vaccine Thursday that showed while the vaccine was more than 89% effective in a Phase 3 trial in Britain, a smaller, earlier Phase 2 trial conducted in South Africa while the variant was circulating showed efficacy there was only 60%. Just in case, Pfizer and Moderna say they are working to make booster vaccines that would address mutant versions. The design of the vaccines is meant to make that a quick and easy process -- just plugging in a new version of the genetic code used to generate the vaccines will do it.There's also evidence the changes may help some escape from monoclonal antibody treatments made by Eli Lilly and Co. and Regeneron.A variant suspected of fueling a resurgence of viral spread in Brazil turned up in Minnesota for the first time in January. It was in a traveler from Brazil, so there's no indication yet of community spread.This variant, called P.1, was found in 42% of specimens in one survey done in the Brazilian city of Manaus, and Japanese officials found the variant in four travelers from Brazil.\"The emergence of this variant raises concerns of a potential increase in transmissibility or propensity for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection of individuals,\" the CDC said. P.1 also carries the E484K mutation. Finally, there's a variant seen in California, as well as a dozen other states. \"We don't know yet what the significance of that one is,\" said Armstrong. It also has a mutation in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. It is called L452R and while it's being found commonly, it's not yet clear if it's more transmissible. Any viral strain can become more common because of what's known as the founder effect. \"The founder effect is a matter of a virus being in the right place at the right time,\" Armstrong said. If a particular strain happens to be circulating when transmission increases because of human behavior, that strain will ride along and become more common not because it spreads more easily, but simply because it was there.It will take more study to show whether these variants can increase the already astronomical spread of the virus. The US has more than 25 million diagnosed cases and more than 430,000 deaths. But the University of Washington's  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has now started including the variants in its projections.\"Rapid variant spread can extend the period of daily deaths over 1,000 well past May 1,\" it says in its  The IHME projects 595,000 people will have died in the US by May 1.\"The emergence of variants underscores the need for public health action,\" Walensky advised.\"First, get vaccinated when it's your turn. Also, some people may need help getting vaccinated -- please consider helping your neighbors and loved ones schedule or travel to their appointments. Second, wear a mask. Practice social distancing and wash your hands. And finally, now is not the time to travel.\"", "summary": "Variant strains of coronavirus have been turning up across the US, including new types seen first in the UK, South Africa and Brazil.

{"text": "Who needs Valentine's Day during a year when getting close to people means you could catch a lot more than a case of lovesick? This is the perfect year to lean into a more socially distanced and, frankly, less pressured holiday. The antidote? Embrace Galentine's Day.Born from the ancient, mystic sitcom \"Parks and Recreation,\" the \"Galentine's Day\" episode  on February 11, 2010. It features Amy Poehler's character, Leslie, as she navigates her way through a day of love-life disappointments -- in trying to set up her mother on what turns out to be a bad date and dealing with her own partner's rude behavior. She rebels against the traditional slog of Valentine's Day and invents a day to rejoice with her girlfriends and celebrate herself.You may be one of the more than  who aren't partnered up. Or if you are, maybe you're tired of being with your significant other 24/7 for the past year and would rather pretend you're single. Galentine's Day, which falls on the day before Valentine's Day, is for you.The tradition, which has grown from a one-off TV stint to a commercially viable and widely practiced holiday, typically includes brunching with your gal pals. A copious amount of booze is generally encouraged. In-person shenanigans may need to take place via Zoom this year (can you say \"Galentine Gallianos? Mama mimosas?), but why not also consider breaking with the usual rituals and deliver a dose of self-care?Whether or not you are imbibing with your girlies remotely, trying to get a minute to yourself in a full house, or rocking it solo and physically distant this Valentine's Day, it's not a bad idea to turn inward after such a challenging few months and direct some love and tender care at yourself.\"Loving yourself is the single most important element of having a healthy relationship,\" said New York metro-based dating and relationship expert Rachel DeAlto. \"Start looking at who in your life isn't lifting you up. Of course, self-love is an inside job, but so often we let those around us affect our confidence and feelings of self-worth.\"It may be hard to love yourself on command, but you can start by imagining yourself as a separate person, according to Lauren Cook, a Los Angeles-based clinical psychologist, speaker and author. \"Just as you may give another person a Valentine's day gift, write a heartfelt card, or spend quality time together, take these practices inward,\" she said via email. \"We often do not treat ourselves as well as we treat others and Valentine's Day is a prime opportunity to actually think about how we can practice self-love and self-compassion.\"To love yourself more truly and deeply, it helps to try to unpack all those layers of social conditioning that were piled on us over a lifetime, and which strip away our ability to just love ourselves for who we are, without the judgment and doubt and self-consciousness.\"Recognize that you were born loving yourself. Babies know they are fierce and beautiful, they don't need validation for that,\" said New York-based family and relationship therapist Damon A. Jacobs.To deepen your self-love, according to Jacobs, learn who you are by spending quality time by yourself and participating in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment and deepen reflection. And there's a silver lining. \"Once you're nurturing attention and energy toward yourself on those levels, you literally become an attractive magnet for others,\" he said. Practice \"unlearning\" by actively focusing on your positive attributes and not the negative ones, which we so often get stuck on. That will help to retrain your brain to lean into your kinder thoughts about yourself and encourage deeper self-appreciation. Plus, there is what Jacobs refers to as focusing on that which is \"evidence-based,\" or what others might consider perspective.\"If you survived 2020, you did at least 4,380 things well (that's 12 good things each day). Allow your feelings about yourself to be determined by the evidence of your life, not the skewed opinions of your critical voice,\" Jacobs said. Focus on the good things you experienced, the good deeds you committed, the ways in which you helped others.  \"If you want to feel love, then do loving things,\" he said. In a world that feels sorely lacking in love and loving-kindness lately, there's no better advice than that.

{"text": "Adam Bayer and his wife Traci own Hillcrest Pharmacy, located in the 11,000-person town of Vernon, Texas. It's one of the pharmacies receiving coronavirus vaccines as part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program that began a much-anticipated rollout this week. The Bayers are among the first in the nation to administer vaccines under the program.When the pharmacy received the shipment of Moderna doses late Wednesday, the Bayers -- both pharmacists -- started calling people they knew were eligible.  The first call Traci made was to a couple in their mid-70s who had been quarantined for nearly a year, not even seeing their children or grandchildren because of their age and underlying conditions. \"Our pharmacy was the first place they'd been since March,\" Adam Bayer told CNN.  \"I knew that they truly needed it. And the sooner that we can get them vaccinated, the sooner they can start living a more normal life. Of course, I still recommend people wear masks and social distance, but they could go into a grocery store, go see their grandkids,\" Bayer said.  Last week, the Biden administration announced the federal government would begin direct shipments of vaccines to retail pharmacies, with a total of 1 million doses going to about 6,500 stores, before eventually expanding. The coordinated effort is expected to help expand vaccine uptake. The program this week was met with fanfare, a few technical glitches and plenty of sore arms. Twenty-one pharmacy chains are included in this ambitious first-time rollout, including CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid and Walmart. Many experts say turning to retail pharmacies to increase vaccine uptake makes sense as a way to minimize the logistical challenges in state and local health departments. And with clinics and hospitals struggling to provide care for patients sick with Covid-19 -- especially in small rural communities -- taking vaccines elsewhere makes sense. \"Millions of Americans turn to their local pharmacies every day for their medicines, flu shots, and much more,\" White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said in a briefing on February 2 when the rollout was announced. \"And pharmacies are readily accessible in most communities, with most Americans living within five miles of a pharmacy.\" Steven Anderson, president and CEO of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, says he's confident the 1-million goal can be met, as long as enough vaccine ends up in pharmacies.  \"Ultimately NACDS member pharmacies can meet and exceed the 100 million vaccinations in a month threshold, yet it's important to understand that the supply of vaccines remains the rate-limiting factor in the vaccination effort,\" he said. A majority of these 1 million doses distributed through the program were allocated to CVS, Walmart, Walgreens and Rite Aid. CVS received 250,000 doses, Walmart about 200,000, Walgreens about 180,000, and Rite Aid about 116,000.  These doses are separate from the allocations that the federal government is sending to each state, though they are still subject to each state's eligibility guidelines. Without this federal program, Adam Bayer said Hillcrest Pharmacy would not be able to vaccinate the community. He said the state of Texas allocated the pharmacy only enough doses to vaccinate 100 people in December as part of the state vaccination program. As pharmacists on the front lines, Traci and Adam Bayer were able to get their shots early. When the pharmacy began receiving vaccines in December, Traci used one dose to vaccinate her husband. Then, the next day, he used one to vaccinate his wife. Then they kept vaccinating -- mostly other healthcare workers due to eligibility requirements at the time -- until their supply ran out. Every Monday morning since then, the Bayers requested 1,000 doses from the state but the focus had already shifted to bigger cities. The federal program hopes to address that problem. \"We don't want to be forgotten in the rural areas,\" he said. \"We're up to the challenge, we just need the vaccine. And we need them to remember us,\" Bayer said.On Friday morning, people lined up to receive their first doses at a local CVS pharmacy in East Los Angeles, one of the hardest-hit communities.Lisa Kalajian, the CVS Health District Leader, told CNN it was important for CVS to pick locations in the underserved communities.\"The process has been extremely fluid, we have an incredible storage system that's coming in for the vaccines,\" said Kalajian. \"We've had absolutely no issues with receiving the vaccines and preparing them for today's vaccine clinics.\"The location expected over 100 people on its first day of appointments, each slot was booked and the day proceeded with some ease.But in Florida, there was a glitch in Walmart's scheduling system. Walmart's website was allowing people in Florida with preexisting conditions to register for vaccination appointments, despite Gov. Ron DeSantis' \"Seniors First\" vaccination plan for the state that prioritizes seniors, long-term care facility residents and staff, and health care personnel with direct patient contact. In a statement to CNN, a Walmart spokesperson said the criteria for the vaccine program are established by each state's department of health. \"In Florida, Walmart's scheduling program defaulted to the criteria on the DOH website\" instead of the criteria set up by the governor's order. The pharmacy chain agreed to honor already-scheduled appointments. There haven't been any glitches for Hillcrest Pharmacy, just a growing wait-list. Currently, there are 500 people who are eligible for vaccines and have requested appointments. The couple know most of them personally. As a participant in the federal program, Hillcrest Pharmacy will receive 100 doses per week until it comes time for second doses, Adam Bayer said. At that point, the pharmacy will receive 200 doses -- 100 for new vaccinations, and 100 for second doses, he said.  \"We have people that are sick and we've had people in our community that have gotten Covid and died that otherwise would not have, if they would have had the vaccine,\" Adam Bayer said.Jamiel Lynch, Lauren Mascarenhas and Chris Audick contributed to this report", "summary": "Adam Bayer and his wife Traci own Hillcrest Pharmacy, located in the 11,000-person town of Vernon, Texas.

It's just not necessary for them to quarantine.\"Fully vaccinated persons who meet criteria will no longer be required to quarantine following an exposure to someone with COVID-19,\" the CDC said in  with guidance on vaccination.\"Vaccinated persons with an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are not required to quarantine if they meet all of the following criteria,\" the CDC added. The criteria: They must be fully vaccinated -- having had both shots with at least two weeks having passed since the second shot. That's because it takes two weeks to build full immunity after the second dose of vaccine.But the CDC says it's not known how long protection lasts, so people who had their last shot three months ago or more should still quarantine if they are exposed. They also should quarantine if they show symptoms, the CDC said.\"This recommendation to waive quarantine for people with vaccine-derived immunity aligns with quarantine recommendations for those with natural immunity, which eases implementation,\" the CDC said. The agency will update guidance as more is learned.People who have been vaccinated should still watch for symptoms for 14 days after they have been exposed to someone who is infected, the CDC said.And everyone, vaccinated or not, needs to follow all other precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, the CDC said. This is not least because it's possible even vaccinated people could harbor the virus in their noses and throats, and pass it to others.\"At this time, vaccinated persons should continue to follow current guidance to protect themselves and others, including wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet away from others, avoiding crowds, avoiding poorly ventilated spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands often, following CDC travel guidance, and following any applicable workplace or school guidance, including guidance related to personal protective equipment use or SARS-CoV-2 testing,\" the agency said.Vaccines prevent symptomatic illness but they have not yet been shown to prevent asymptomatic illness, the CDC noted. While people with no symptoms can spread coronavirus, the CDC said, \"symptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is thought to have a greater role in transmission than purely asymptomatic transmission.\"Plus, the benefits of not unnecessarily forcing people into lockdown for two weeks may outweigh the risks of transmission in these cases, the CDC said.\"These criteria could also be applied when considering work restrictions for fully vaccinated healthcare personnel with higher-risk exposures, as a strategy to alleviate staffing shortages. Of note, exposed healthcare personnel would not be required to quarantine outside of work, the CDC said.\"As an exception to the above guidance no longer requiring quarantine for fully vaccinated persons, vaccinated inpatients and residents in healthcare settings should continue to quarantine following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; outpatients should be cared for using appropriate Transmission-Based Precautions,\" the CDC added.That's because it's not clear how effective the vaccine is in people who are hospitalized.\"Although not preferred, healthcare facilities could consider waiving quarantine for vaccinated patients and residents as a strategy to mitigate critical issues (e.g., lack of space, staff, or PPE to safely care for exposed patients or residents) when other options are unsuccessful or unavailable. These decisions could be made in consultation with public health officials and infection control experts.\"", "summary": "People who have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus -- right now that means with two doses of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine -- can skip quarantine if they are exposed to someone infected with the virus, CDC said Wednesday."},

But it also appears to suppress appetite.\"Weight loss with semaglutide stems from a reduction in energy intake owing to a decreased appetite, which is thought to result from direct and indirect effects on the brain,\" Dr. Robert Kushner of Northwestern University and colleagues across the country wrote in their report, published in The New England Journal of Medicine.They tested it in 1,961 people who were either overweight or obese. A third got placebo plus dietary counseling and exercise coaching, while two-thirds got the drug with the same diet and exercise plan.\"The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was 14.9% in the semaglutide group compared with 2.4% with placebo,\" Kushner's team wrote. On average, people who took the drug lost 15.3 kg, or 33 pounds.People who took the drug were more likely to suffer nausea, diarrhea, vomiting or constipation, the researchers said. Nearly three-quarters did, compared to just under half of those who took placebo.But 80% of the volunteers stuck it out for the trial that lasted nearly a year and a half. The researchers think at least some people would accept a once-a-week injected drug.\"Currently, approved antiobesity drugs require administration once, twice or three times daily, and a once-weekly regimen may improve treatment adherence,\" they wrote.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  meaning they have a body mass index of 30 or more.

But they saw big weaknesses. \"First, the demographics in this trial are not reflective of the general US population.

Many have been pulled from the market because of side effects.\"While a drug like this may prove useful in the short term for obtaining rapid weight loss in severe obesity, they are not a magic bullet for preventing or treating less severe degrees of obesity,\" Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition at King's College London, said in a statement.\"Public health measures that encourage behavioral changes such as regular physical activity and moderating dietary energy intake are still needed.

Masks protect you and me\" by preventing the spread of droplets and aerosol that may contain the virus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says in its .Just because vaccines are here doesn't mean Americans should let down their guard. In fact, Dr. Richard Besser, former acting CDC director, said that would be \"incredibly risky.\"\"It is absolutely essential that we continue to do steps beyond vaccination to keep this under control,\" Besser said.The more the virus has the opportunity to spread, the greater the risk that it will mutate and more variants will appear, as have the variants first identified in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil.\"And if the vaccines aren't as effective against some of these variants, then we could see the gains that we're so excited about right now, we could see those reversed in a very short amount of time.\"In the beginning of the pandemic, we were told , and to reserve them for those who were sick or for health care workers. But that was before scientists understood how the virus was transmitted, and it was at a time when there was a shortage of masks among health care workers.Now, some people are even recommending wearing two masks at once. Here's what you should know about masks.President Joe Biden has called on everyone to wear a mask when out in public, and he has made it mandatory on federal property. Masks are required on public transportation and in airports and transit stations.have some type of mask mandate in place, and most retailers require shoppers to wear them in their stores.It's important to note that children younger than 2 should not wear a mask, according to the CDC. Now, more than a year into the pandemic, Americans may soon get  so we will know which masks work best.ASTM International, an international technical standards organization, and the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory are working on standards on filter efficiency, sizing and fit, cleaning and recommended period of use or reuse. are the gold standard of masks because they block 95% of large and small particles using an electrostatic filter. If everyone would wear N95 masks for four weeks in risky settings, \"it would stop the epidemic,\" Dr. Abraar Karan, an internal medicine physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, .Beware of  -- they have flooded the market, and they may not meet safety standards. Look for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's NIOSH stamp of approval. Some health experts are , but they are currently reserved for health care workers, partly because of a shortage of the masks. KN95 masks also offer good protection, but they are not certified by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. A few manufacturers of KN95 masks have been given  for them to be used in health care settings in the United States.Surgical masks have three layers and generally offer more protection than cloth masks. Cloth masks have the advantage of being washable and reusable. Be sure that the mask has at least two layers -- the more layers, the better. \"If you're wearing a cloth mask, it should be a multi-layered mask so that you have several layers of potential protection for a single mask,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told CNN's Anderson Cooper and Sanjay Gupta. Aside from their scarcity, N95 masks are \"very hard to tolerate when you wear them for long periods of time,\" Walensky said. \"I worry that if we suggest or require that people wear an N95, they won't wear them all the time. They're very hard to breathe in, when you wear them properly,\" she said.The CDC on Wednesday  to suggest wearing a cloth mask over a disposable mask, such as one of those blue surgical masks, as a way to add more protection.In fact, new data from the CDC shows that layering a cloth mask over a disposable medical mask can block 92.5% of potentially infectious particles from escaping by creating a tighter fit and eliminating leakage.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, recently has been sporting two masks, one on top of the other.The CDC advised people not to wear two disposable masks, however. \"Disposable masks are not designed to fit tightly and wearing more than one will not improve fit,\" the CDC said in its updated guidance.You also should not wear any mask over a KN95 mask, the CDC said.\"We continue to recommend that masks should have two or more layers, completely cover your nose and mouth, and fit snugly against your nose and the sides of your face,\" Walensky said at a White House briefing Wednesday.", "summary": "Let's face it: Even as more people get vaccinated against Covid-19, everyone but small children will still need to wear a face mask for the foreseeable future."},

A resident at Roosevelt Care Center in Old Bridge, New Jersey, Connelly misses her family, which includes five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, one of whom was born during the pandemic. She wants to see their faces, especially the newborn she hasn't met, and join in family get-togethers and birthday soirees -- and she wouldn't mind a bloody Mary or glass of white wine. \"I'm getting out of here and partying,\" she said when asked her plans upon being cleared for outings. \"I miss seeing my family. I miss their smiles, their hugs and their kisses. I miss the freedom of going out.\"The first order of business will be to round up the babies -- and their parents, of course -- and \"have fun and have a party like we used to,\" Connelly told CNN. \"That's what old people miss,\" she said. \"They don't miss very much in life.\" The vaccine doesn't make seniors bulletproof, but it makes them safer -- and hopeful, delivering a sense of relief after a year of oft-lonely lockdown away from the loved ones they rely on not just for errands and caretaking but conversation, company and touch.Almost 10 million people in the United States have received their second dose. About 12% of the recipients are , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that doesn't mean the more than 600,000 seniors who've gotten both shots can jump back into their pre-pandemic lives.Depending on the state and facility, restrictions remain in place at most assisted living, skilled nursing and retirement communities. Federal guidelines advise even after the second dose people should continue wearing masks and distancing. The CDC may soon update that guidance, as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, , \"I believe that's going to change.\"Connelly frets over the lost year with her youngest. Video calls aren't the same as in-person great-grandmotherly love. She worries the children \"might hear you on the phone or see you on a screen, but it's not the same. They don't know who you are. They thinking they're playing with a game.\"Seniors are thirsty for normalcy, or at least what will pass for normal once the pandemic is over. It means a chance to go out for coffee, visit the beach or return to a favorite restaurant, but most of all, it means being close to family -- and not in the metaphorical sense. \"When you have that many kids, you want to see them. You want to be with them,\" Connelly said. \"Even though you make the best of it in here, you want to see the people you are attached to. That's what's important, and that's why the vaccination is very important.\"Gerrie Pearlin lives at Dominican Oaks in Santa Cruz, California. She misses trips to the shore and to her favorite downtown coffee shop, but she mostly longs for the bits of culture that coronavirus has stolen -- the bookstore, the theater, the \"wonderful symphony.\"The 93-year-old's daughter and son-in-law live nearby. They drop off groceries, and Pearlin enjoys seeing them and chatting from 6 feet away, but she's ready for a real visit. \"That's what we do miss, a good hug,\" she said. \"We're in a very protected world. Even though you get frustrated with it, you have to sit back and say, 'I'm damned lucky.' Everyone has complaints, right? That adds to your good mental health. Of course, we complain, but it's in a very different context.\"Mary Ellen Philp, 93, wants to see family as well. A resident of Bellbrook in Rochester Hills, Michigan, north of Detroit, she can't see or walk as well as she used to, so while she appreciates video calls and waving to her children and grandchildren from her apartment balcony, she feels she's missing out on their lives. One of her great-grandsons is about to turn 3 and just discovered music. He's constantly dancing, she said. \"They are funny and cute and, you know, I just like to watch them,\" she said of the youngsters among her 11 great grandchildren. Philp, too, considers herself fortunate because her daughter is a longtime employee of Bellbrook. Philp has spent about half of her two years at the community in lockdown, so seeing her daughter buoys her.\"I catch a glimpse of her periodically,\" she said, adding with a chuckle, \"Otherwise, I'd be a stark raving maniac if I didn't see Margaret.\"Joe Sanders of Princeton, West Virginia, can't wait to get back to Cracker Barrel for country ham and red-eye gravy. He wouldn't mind a fishing trip, too. His days of hiking into the mountains for trout or hooking sailfish off the Outer Banks have passed, he said, but he'd love to hop on a boat and go looking for freshwater bass. The second shot, which the 93-year-old received in early January, brought hope that a return to those pastimes is coming. \"I felt like, 'Boy, I'm going to make it,' OK? I was just really relieved, and I have hope that I'm going to get out of here and do some things,\" Sanders said. \"That kind of sustains you, instead of feeling you're going to be here till the end.\"While headlines abound  in the national vaccine rollout, administrators at several senior facilities say their campaigns have gone swimmingly. Two things the ? Communication and a sense of community. Larry Pack, CEO of Stonerise Healthcare, oversees 17 facilities in West Virginia and Ohio, including the Princeton location where Sanders lives. In addition to education campaigns -- including forums with medical directors and Gov. Jim Justice's public service announcements -- the decision to partner with small pharmacies proved a boon, he said. Small businesses are nimble, with less bureaucracy, Pack said, and the state's approach makes it easy to find the right person to address issues. \"That's really what helps us more than ever: It's all personal,\" Pack said. \"The pandemic has been the most difficult part of my professional life, no question. We finally have a tool to fight with.\"Bethany Retirement Living, which has more than 500 residents at two locations in Fargo, North Dakota, partnered with a regional pharmacy chain, said spokesman Grant Richardson, who also credited a community approach to the rollout's success in a state where \"we're really connected; we're all related to someone down the road.\"Education is key, he said, explaining staff held one-on-one Q&A sessions and produced a Facebook video explaining how getting vaccinated will improve residents' lives. Roosevelt Care Center at Old Bridge, where Rosemary Connelly lives, had New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on hand when resident Mildred Clements, 103, and nurse Esther Moody became the state's first recipients of the vaccine. Murphy returned when they received their second doses January 18, said Bentzy Davidowitz, administrator at the facility where more than 90% of the 168 residents have received both doses. Other facilities added creativity into their campaigns. Harmony Square residents in Brentwood, Tennessee, gathered to smash a chocolate-filled piñata shaped like a Covid-19 germ. Garden Valley Retirement Village in Garden City, Kansas, had health care workers inject seniors as they posed with signs that read, \"Hit me with your best shot\" and \"Right to bare arms.\"Montage Hills Senior Living in Denver made a party of it, complete with balloon animals, music, a photo booth, games, shots (of Gatorade) and a whiteboard where residents wrote down what they're looking forward to, executive director Don McDonald said. \"We want to see our sons. We want to be able to hug our loved ones. We want to be able to touch our loved ones. The social distancing piece of preventing spread affects us,\" he said. \"Seniors rely on physical touch -- hugs and handshakes and running their hands through their children's hair. It's those things that have been expressed on the whiteboard.\"Going out for an ice cream or movie. Getting their hair done. Taking a trip to Walmart. Watching a football game with the boys. Breaking bread with a friend or neighbor. Playing bingo. Going to church. Seeing unmasked people smile. Holding a bridge tournament. Conversing face-to-face with no Plexiglas. Seniors say they're prioritizing the little things. At Dominican Oaks, where all but three of the 195 residents have received their second shot, Pearlin isn't the only one missing culture, said Dominican Hospital President Dr. Nanette Mickiewicz. Her residents miss day trips to San Francisco's museums and to Carmel's outdoor malls and boutiques. They long for their visitors: professors from University of California Santa Cruz, authors and musical acts, including an opera singer who used to perform monthly. In chillier locales, administrators look forward to relaxing visitation rules, as \"window visits\" and congregating outdoors aren't always options.\"Sitting outside mom's window doesn't work when there's snow on the ground, the wind's blowing and the low temperature is 3 degrees above zero,\" Richardson said. (The low in Fargo this week is actually minus 22.) With the vaccine comes the promise of immunity to a virus that has killed almost a half million people in the US,  -- but also the promise of returning to simple pleasures.  \"Excitement is a good word, and hope can do a lot of things for people, but after 10 months, hope starts wearing a little thin, too, so (the vaccine) has really reinforced their hope this will be over soon,\" Richardson said. Philp has her hopes set on a trip to the park along the Clinton River, just outside Rochester Hills.

Sandy Comitini, 64, is eager to see her mother, Connelly, return to her \"partying\" ways. She's been calling Connelly \"20 times a day,\" to the point her mother sometimes takes the phone off the hook. \"I need a nap. I'm 92,\" her mom quipped.

{"text": "Americans' perception of risk from the coronavirus is the lowest it has been since October, a new poll has found.When asked about risk to their health if we returned to normal, pre-pandemic behavior right now — while the pandemic is ongoing — 25% of respondents thought it was a small risk and 9% considered it not risky, according to an  published Tuesday. Sixty-six percent reported they thought returning to pre-pandemic life now was a moderate risk or large risk. The poll was conducted February 5 to 8 and based on a nationally representative sample of 1,030 people age 18 and older.The groups least likely to see Covid-19 as a risk were people ages 18 to 29 (58%) and Republicans (49%), the poll showed. Meanwhile, 76% of those who have been vaccinated still saw coronavirus as a high risk.\"Certain groups are finding that they are invincible and think that they are not going to get as ill as others,\" said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health. \"Also, we have seen Covid-19 become so , and public health measures have become put into categories of partisan ideology rather than understood as the scientific reasons why they must exist.\" Many Americans are unsure about what activities are safe, the poll also suggested: 28% of respondents say they are attending gatherings with family or friends; 22% say they will wait for their circle to be vaccinated; 24% reported they will wait for officials to say it's safe; and 24% don't know. Gathering virtually or only with people you live with is safest, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.Only 10% of Democrats and 15% of people over 65 have already been going to in-person gatherings, in comparison to 42% of Republicans. People over 65 (29%) and those with a college education are more likely to wait for the vaccine (34%).The poll findings come at a time when there is less trust in the media and sources of information about the pandemic. Trust in cable news has dropped since April, from 50% to 38%. Online news was trusted by 36% of respondents and network news by 47%. The poll found that 68% of Americans trust the CDC to provide accurate information about Covid-19, while 51% of Republicans do. Fifty-three percent of Americans continue to trust what President Joe Biden says. The factors contributing to misperception of risks during the pandemic could include conflicting guidance, misguided trust and confidence, pandemic fatigue and distrust in sources of . What the poll \"illustrates to me is that people don't understand where we are in the pandemic, for good reason,\" Wen said.\"On the one hand, we have decreased numbers of hospitalization and new infections. But on the other hand, this is still at a very high level of infection. And we have these  on the way. Restrictions are being lifted in many parts of the country,\" Wen said. \"I could see why people are thinking that the worst of it may be over, and that some of the activities that are actually not safe, people are resuming.\" Additionally, some people may take the introduction of vaccines to mean that we can  much sooner than possible. Regarding the respondents who have already been gathering with family and friends, some people may be safe when going to stores, but tempted to visit loved ones if they already trust them and consider them to be less risky than strangers — but the coronavirus doesn't discriminate in who it infects. \"People don't understand that the risk is actually, for many people, greatest with those who they love rather than with strangers\" since we spend more time with loved ones,\" Wen said. \"There's a level of magical thinking when it comes to coronavirus. Because of asymptomatic transmission, we don't know who has the virus and who does not.\" After plateaus after previous case surges, Wen added, cases have spiked again when people let down their guard. Watching or reading news sources that deem the pandemic a hoax may develop inaccurate perceptions, she said.What everyone may deal with, regardless of what they believe, is pandemic fatigue. \"We get tired of making decisions during uncertainty and some of us will ignore the warnings to reclaim our routines,\" said Jacqueline Gollan, who holds two professorships at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine: one in psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and another in obstetrics in gynecology. \"We prefer pleasure now and risk pain later.\" Whichever reason you think the risk for getting infected with coronavirus is low, understanding two concepts can help you reassess risks and . \"One is the concept of harm reduction, understanding that everything we do has some risk, but there are things we can do to reduce that risk,\" Wen said. \"Masking, avoiding indoor gatherings, keeping physical distancing — they are additive. The more of these measures we do, the more we're protected.\"Secondly, she added, cumulative risk also adds up. \"Just because you are engaging in one activity that's relatively higher risk, doesn't mean that you should engage in others,\" she said. For example, going back to work shouldn't mean that you allow yourself to attend birthday parties as well. And if your children are back in school, they don't need to attend every extracurricular activity. Base your decisions on what is essential, safe and valuable to you — in that order. Instead of gathering with people you don't live with, stick to virtual hangouts if possible. If you have been freely enjoying a social life but luckily haven't been infected with coronavirus, know those times don't mean that you'll keep being lucky, Wen said. Be careful about developing a mindset that you're reluctant to change. \"We pay more attention to information that fits with the mental model, we pay less attention to information that contradicts them, and we twist information to make it fit,\" Gollan said. \"If we think it is unsafe, we will continue to try to assume that activities are unsafe.\" If you don't know whether you can trust a source of information, just asking yourself that question is a good place to start, Wen said. Local health departments, the CDC, hospitals such as Cleveland Clinic or Johns Hopkins Hospital, and esteemed news outlets are a few credible sources. \"Make sure the health science supports what you read or hear or believe,\" Gollan said, as well as what you want to do.  is your brain's natural response to a new and challenging situation. To restore your motivation to follow safety measures and make them habits, set up virtual cues, such as setting your mask on a table by the door to remind yourself to grab it before you leave the house. Ask others what has helped them to stay safe. Practicing stress-relieving activities can make safety habits seem less daunting.Remember that we're not past the worst of it, Wen said. \"If the variants (that are more contagious) are to become dominant here, we could be in for the type of catastrophes that many countries in Europe and South Africa experienced.\" Look for sources of inspiration to keep you practicing safety habits, like visualizing rewards for your choices.

{"text": "For nearly a year, most of our children have been navigating the new, difficult normal: social isolation; deeply stressed parents; the effects of financial uncertainty; school from home — or from WiFi-equipped school buses if they don't have internet. While Covid-19 itself has largely been sparing of children's physical health, studies have shown it has taken a toll on their mental health, associated with an increase in suicide-related behaviors, experts say. Suicide was the  among children and adolescents ages 10 to 19 in the United States as of 2018, before the pandemic struck. Though suicide attempts and ideation weren't consistently higher in 2020, a recent  in the journal Pediatrics found some increases. \"Months with significantly higher rates of suicide-related behaviors appear to correspond to times when COVID-related stressors and community responses were heightened, indicating that youth experienced elevated distress during these periods,\" the report, which looked at people between the ages of 11 and 21, noted.According to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255), the most recent completed month, December 2020, shows a 4% increase in NSPL call volume from December 2019, though not all months during the pandemic showed increases. \"Adolescents are very peer-focused under ordinary circumstances,\" said Lisa Furst, chief program officer of Vibrant Emotional Health, which, among other things, runs the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. \"The nature of the public health measures such as remote school and physical distancing may impact teens and youth very significantly because they feel so isolated from their peer group.\"Much needs to be done at the national and policy level to help kids, such as making therapy affordable and readily available and improving access to providers, according to the . But there are preventive measures parents and guardians can take, both immediate and longer-term, for kids who are seemingly faring OK or those in crisis.\"One of the ways to prevent pediatric suicide attempts is to keep your medications locked away,\" said Dr. Julie Williamson, associate professor of anesthesiology and pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta. \"For adolescents, suicide is often extremely impulsive and not pre-planned, so even small barriers can keep catastrophes from happening.\" Parents should invest in a lockbox, and not just for potentially fatal prescription drugs, Williamson suggested. \"Attain a lockbox for even nonprescription medications like Tylenol,\" she said. That will also help guard against accidental overdose. \"For smaller children, it will keep them from accidentally taking pills or medications that look like candy.\"The same goes for other potentially harmful objects, especially if kids are in distress. Sharp objects should be hidden or stored in a place where only adults can get to them. \"If there's a gun in the house, get rid of it for a while,\" Furst said. Both Williamson and Furst suggested keeping a watchful eye on children during the pandemic, and not just the children who have expressed feelings of anxiety or depression or communicated a desire to die. If a child becomes moody or withdrawn, or has major changes in appetite or sleep, they say, it may be time to find a mental health provider. \"Noticing changes in behavior is important,\" Furst said.If your child is actively in crisis, Williamson said, call 911 or crisis hotlines like NSPL. \"If it's not a crisis, start with your pediatrician,\" she suggested. Your doctor should be able to steer you toward someone to talk to and where to get help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline's  campaign lists five steps every person can take to help prevent suicide in a person of any age.Children and teens are very reliant on social connection, which has been severely limited by the pandemic. \"We have to help young people to stay connected socially as much as possible in safe ways,\" Furst said. She noted that \"social distancing\" is a misnomer, and the opposite of what kids need. It's physical distancing we require during the pandemic, but social and emotional closeness is more important than ever. \"Technology can be leveraged there,\" Furst said. It's a slippery slope, trying to get kids to connect digitally without a different kind of screen-time overload setting in — but we have to try. Back in March, many people expected that they'd be getting back to normal after a few months, but that hasn't happened. \"We had pinned our hopes on getting through winter and the vaccine being here, and the distribution of the vaccine is going to be delayed, even for those who want it,\" Williamson said. \"There may be a surge of disappointment right now.\"We can all reassure children that it's normal to be struggling. \"Check in with your children and let them know this is a historically hard time for everybody,\" Williamson said. And then assure them: \"It will pass.\"", "summary": "The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on children's mental health, associated with an increase in suicide-related behaviors, experts say.

But letting your guard down could be an open invitation for to trample the US -- erasing the progress made. \"We're ... seeing what happens in other countries when these variants take over,\" emergency physician said. \"There is (an) explosive surge, even when the countries are basically in shutdown.\"The warning comes as more Americans believe there's no big risk in returning to pre-Covid life, according to a new poll.An Axios-Ipsos poll published Tuesday showed 66% of those surveyed said they thought the risk of returning to pre-Covid life was moderate or large. That's the lowest percentage since October.  The groups least likely to see Covid-19 as a risk were people ages 18 to 29 (58%) and Republicans (49%). But a majority of those vaccinated -- 76% -- still see coronavirus as a high risk.Americans shouldn't assume the vaccine rollout means it's OK to get lax with safety measures. In fact, ditching precautions now would be \"incredibly risky,\" said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"It is absolutely essential that we continue to do steps beyond vaccination to keep this under control,\" Besser said.\"The reason for that is that the more this virus is allowed to spread in our communities, the more we're going to see these variants spreading,\" he said. \"And if the vaccines aren't as effective against some of these variants, then we could see the gains that we're so excited about right now, we could see those reversed in a very short amount of time.\" -- The US has averaged 110,854 new Covid-19 cases each day over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University. That's down 24% compared to the previous week. (But testing has dropped by 12.3% over the same time period, according to the COVID Tracking Project.)-- Covid-19 hospitalizations have decreased 12.53% this past week, compared to the previous week, according to the project.-- The national test positivity rate -- or the percentage of tests taken that turn out to be positive -- now averages 6.93%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. That number has steadily declined since the record high of 13.55% on January 8. But the World Health Organization has recommended governments  for at least two weeks.Scientists are worried about  that are now in the US. They include the B.1.1.7 variant, first detected in the UK, ; and the B.1.351 strain, first discovered in South Africa, which .There are now more than 940 reported cases of in the United States, according to data updated Tuesday by the the CDC, and 932 of them are the variant first identified in the United Kingdom. The US faces \"something really potentially catastrophic, and we should be doubling down on the measures that we know to work,\" said Wen, a visiting professor at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health.Despite similar comments from other health experts, some states are letting go of certain safety precautions: -- North Dakota's statewide mask mandate . Gov. Doug Burgum said last week Covid-19 numbers would go up. -- Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds recently signed an executive order ending all mask requirements, gathering restrictions and other public health emergency mandates, while encouraging residents to follow recommended safety guidelines.-- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said New York City indoor dining can reopen at 25% capacity starting Friday. But the state could tighten restrictions again if needed. \"As we move forward, we're continuing to respond to the facts and data every day,\" , \"and when the enemy changes tactics, we change with the enemy.\"About 1 in 10 people in the United States -- nearly 32.9 million people -- have received at least one dose of their two-dose vaccines, according to  data. More than 9.8 million people have been fully vaccinated with both doses, CDC data shows. That's about 3% of the US population.Tuesday, the Biden administration announced it's increasing the weekly supply of doses going to states, tribes and territories to 11 million doses. That's a 28% increase in supply since the administration took office three weeks ago, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said. Zients attributed the increase to support for manufacturing, including the use of the Defense Production Act to help get more equipment to Pfizer and a distribution system that allows a rolling inventory of first and second doses to ship to states.\"The increase is 5% this week over last week, but it's 28% across the last three weeks,\" Zients said. \"I think it's the manufacturers doing a good job and the President and the team doing all we can to support that manufacturing process.\"Local and state officials have said they've been challenged by limited supply and trying to ensure fair access.Starting Tuesday, Los Angeles County will offer appointments only for second doses of the vaccine to \"ensure that we have enough doses to guarantee a second dose for people who already received the first one,\" county Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Monday. That plan will stay in place for the rest of this week.\"Scheduling an appointment right now is challenging because of the limited supply of vaccines that the county is receiving on a weekly basis,\" county health officials said Monday.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said the state will produce demographic data every week to track where vaccine doses go, so that they will be \"held accountable\" for equitable access. \"Black and African American Kentuckians, to date, have received about 4.3% of vaccinations where we know the person's race. That is unacceptable,\" Beshear said Monday.\"About 1.1% of vaccines, where ethnicity is known, have gone to our Hispanic population -- also too low.\"The first multicenter study to  suggests preschool-age children are not superspreaders. When the right public health measures are implemented, day care centers are safe for both children and staff members, the researchers said. The study was published Monday in Lancet Child & Adolescent Health and conducted in the French cities of Paris, Rouen and Annecy between June 4 and July 3 -- up to two months after France's first national lockdown started easing.The study used data from rapid antibody tests and found the prevalence of antibodies for children at day care centers was only 3.7% -- well below the national rate of 10% found in adults in the same time period. The 14 children who were found to have antibodies came from 13 centers, and the two children from the same center never had contact. At those day care centers, staff members wore face masks; enrollment and staffing were reduced; children who became symptomatic were excluded; staff conducted regular temperature checks and reinforced hand hygiene; and everyone practiced physical distancing. But the researchers said one limitation to the study was that data were collected before the emergence of coronavirus variants that some experts suggest may be more transmissible in children.In the US, more than 2.9 million children have been infected with coronavirus throughout this pandemic, according to alast week from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association. Covid-19 cases in children represent about 13% of all US cases, the report said. But the definition of \"child\" varied by state. , while some considered children to be anyone younger than 20.Severe illness from the virus is rare among children, the report \"However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects,\" it said.

{"text": "Terri Lynn in Naples, Florida said that she had to embark on a repeat three-hour road trip for her second dose. Elsie Morales in New York said that her grandmother is still waiting for her second dose -- and it's a week overdue.Lynn and Morales are among some of the people in the United States who have faced challenges with scheduling appointments for second doses of Covid-19 vaccine.\"There is some confusion out there,\" Lynn said. \"I'm just telling my friends and people I know to stay focused and read what you can and empower yourself.\"When Lynn learned in January that the Publix supermarket chain was beginning to offer Covid-19 vaccinations in some of its stores in Florida, she immediately booked an appointment online for herself and her husband Mark Young. They are in the prioritized age group of 65 and older in the state of Florida, and Lynn said that she was \"ecstatic\" they were going to get vaccinated. However, getting to their appointments was a challenge.At the time, Publix was rolling out the vaccinations in three counties in Florida as a test, Lynn said, adding that her husband and she don't live near those counties. \"So, it did require a lot -- a long car ride and a hotel stay,\" Lynn told CNN on Monday. \"The city that this was taking place in -- Spring Hill, Florida -- is over three hours away. I think my appointment was for 9:30 in the morning, and I didn't want to risk it with a three-hour-plus ride that day. So we decided, we're going to sleep overnight,\" Lynn said. \"We even did a test run that night to see where our hotel was in relationship to the supermarket. That's how careful we were.\"Lynn said that on the morning of their appointments, she thought the vaccinations were \"very organized.\" She said that she received a first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and was told she could visit any Publix location to get her second dose. The Moderna vaccine is administered as two shots, 28 days apart.\"This is when everybody was being very optimistic, thinking that there was just a ton of doses that are going to be coming through the pipeline,\" Lynn said.Once 28 days passed, Lynn said that she made a reservation at a Publix location near her home to receive her second dose.\"I was so happy,\" Lynn said. \"And then about an hour later, we got a phone call from the pharmacist from that Publix saying you can't have that appointment. How come? 'Because we have you down for going to Spring Hill, Florida. There's a dosage, with your name on it. And that's the one that you're supposed to get.'\"Lynn said that her husband and she drove three hours again to make their early morning appointments last Saturday. They stayed overnight in the same hotel.\"It was like deja vu, making the same ride, going up to the hotel. This time we didn't have to do a test run because we knew where the supermarket was,\" Lynn said. Lynn said that her husband and she successfully received their second doses. She described the whole experience of getting those second-dose appointments as \"topsy-turvy,\" but worth the hassle.\"This is life and death -- and I just want to give myself all the advantages that I can, and I just hope other people feel that way too. And hopefully a story like this will empower people that you just can't wait,\" she said.Morales, based in New York, said that she felt strongly that her grandparents, who live in Florida, should get their Covid-19 vaccines.Her mother's father, 87, and her mother's mother, 85, were diagnosed with Covid-19 over the summer, she said, and her family does not want to go through that again.\"His case was much more severe than my grandmother's. It was a very scary time,\" Morales said. \"Thankfully, they both recovered.\"As soon as vaccines became available in Florida, Morales said that her mother, Dellonilda Padrón, who lives near the grandparents, worked on getting their vaccinations scheduled.Dellonilda told CNN on Monday that her father still has not received the vaccine but she was able to make an appointment for her mother to get a first dose at Leon Medical Center-West Chester in Miami. Her mother, Rosario Estela Padrón, received a dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and was scheduled to return to the medical center in 21 days to receive her second dose.\"She was supposed to get the second one on the third of February,\" Dellonilda told CNN on Tuesday. But Dellonilda said that when she called the medical center to confirm the time of her mother's second-dose appointment, she was told that there were no vaccine doses available.\"They don't have the second one and I called almost every day,\" Dellonilda said. \"They told me that they will call me when they get the second batch.\"Dellonilda said that, while trying to schedule her parents' vaccination appointments, she was told some misinformation about the vaccine -- including staff at the medical center telling her that her parents \"probably don't need it anyways\" because they already had Covid-19, she said. Dellonilda's daughter Morales told CNN on Tuesday that she is \"very concerned\" that this type of misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccine came from a health care  provider.Health officials currently urge people who have recovered from Covid-19 to be immunized. CNN contacted Leon Medical Centers on Tuesday to confirm its policy and was told \"we recommend that patients who had Covid-19 before still get vaccinated.\"Leon Medical Centers told CNN in an emailed statement that any patient in its health system who has received a first dose is automatically scheduled for a second dose and second doses are currently in stock and on site.\"To be clear, no one who is scheduled for a second dose, and has been clinically cleared, has been denied a second dose because of lack of vaccine,\" the statement said. The center has confirmed with CNN that it will \"clear up any confusion\" over Dellonilda's mother Rosario's second dose.Dellonilda confirmed on Tuesday that Leon Medical Centers contacted her in response to CNN's reporting, and she plans to take her mother to get the second dose of vaccine on Wednesday. The center added in its statement that the vaccination process has been \"smooth\" so far and \"we are honored to be playing a small role in this effort.\"In response to Leon Medical Centers' statement, Dellonilda's daughter Morales told CNN on Tuesday that she does not believe the challenges with scheduling her grandparents' vaccine appointments were due to \"clerical error.\" Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), told CNN on Monday that she has heard anecdotal reports of some vaccination sites canceling appointments for second doses, but it remains unclear why cancellations are happening since second doses are automatically reserved when initial vaccine doses get shipped.\"You get vaccine A at the same time that vaccine B is being held in reserve and so I don't know what could be causing the second vaccine dose not to be there, because the way the system is set up, the shipment automatically occurs at the prescribed interval after the first vaccine is given,\" Freeman said. \"If vaccinators are somehow using that second dose shipment to do first vaccinations for priority groups, then that could skew the whole process,\" she said. \"I don't know why or when that would occur, but I am concerned about hearing these things.\"Freeman said that she plans to take a closer look at these occurrences. NACCHO meets weekly with the White House and Freeman said that she intends to share these concerns in this week's meeting.CNN has contacted the state of Florida -- where Morales's grandparents and Lynn currently live -- for comment. But in some states, second-dose appointments may fall outside of normal schedules.For instance, Chad Wasdin, a spokesperson for Gwinnett, Newton and Rockdale County Health Departments in Georgia, told CNN that some of their second-dose vaccination appointments fall outside of the normal three to four weeks for Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's vaccines, respectively. But all of the second doses are administered within the maximum six weeks recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\"Now that we have larger sites, we are working to move as many second doses closer to their recommended date as we can,\" Wasdin said. \"We have not canceled any second doses.\"In South Carolina, due to concerns around second-dose appointments, the Department of Health and Environmental Control confirmed with CNN on Monday that the  appointment without having their second appointment scheduled, in order to avoid any issues. Washington State Department of Health spokesperson Shelby Anderson also confirmed with CNN that in the state of Washington the department has asked that providers \"schedule second dose appointments while patients are getting their first dose.\"In California, Darrel Ng, a spokesperson for the state's Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force, told CNN in an email on Monday that there has been \"extremely constrained supply\" of vaccine availability.With \"relatively flat\" supply, limited quantities of vaccine devoted to large community clinics three weeks ago will now need to go to provide second vaccine doses, Ng said. \"We are working with our federal partners to increase overall supply to the state,\" he said.The Biden administration announced Tuesday that it is increasing the number of weekly vaccine doses going to states, tribes and territories by 28%.Jeff Zients, White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said at a White House Covid-19 briefing that when the Biden administration came into office, the US government's weekly delivery of vaccines to the states was 8.6 million doses. It's upping that to 11 million Zients said. \"I know Americans are eager to get vaccinated,\" Zients said. \"We're working with manufacturers to increase the supply of vaccines as quickly as possible.\"Zients attributed the increase to support for manufacturing, including the use of the Defense Production Act to help get more equipment to Pfizer, and a distribution system that allows a rolling inventory of first and second doses to ship to states.\"The increase is 5% this week over last week, but it's 28% across the last three weeks,\" Zients said. \"I think it's the manufacturers doing a good job and the President and the team doing all we can to support that manufacturing process.\"The administration announced Friday it would use the DPA to expand priority ratings for Pfizer, including the filling pumps and other components needed to manufacture the Covid-19 vaccines, which would eliminate an existing bottleneck in production.CNN's Jen Christensen, Jamie Gumbrecht, Ashley Ahn and Sandee LaMotte contributed to this report.", "summary": "Americans are jumping through hoops to get their second doses of coronavirus vaccine."},
{"text": "As of now, even if you have been fully vaccinated for , the advice from health officials is to keep wearing your mask, keep social distancing and keep away from get-togethers.But Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday there might be new guidance coming soon. Fauci, the White House pandemic adviser, was speaking at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science when 91-year-old Esther Cohen asked him when she and her friends -- who all have received both vaccine shots -- can safely resume their mah-jongg games.Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said there is no CDC guidance on what to do when groups of people who have received both vaccine doses want to get together. Current CDC advice is to keep wearing a face covering and staying 6 feet from others when possible. \"But I believe that's going to change,\" Fauci said. \"We're talking about this at the level of the CDC.\" Vaccinations began in the United States on December 14. More than 9.5 million people have been fully vaccinated with two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to  The two US-authorized vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech prevent symptomatic infections in most but not all cases. And it is still unclear whether they stop asymptomatic infection.If you are asymptomatic, you would still test positive for Covid-19, and even if you are vaccinated, you could still spread the virus. That's why the guidance now is that even the vaccinated still need to wear masks. A person could be an asymptomatic carrier and have the virus in their nasal passageways, so when they are breathing or speaking or sneezing they could still pass the novel coronavirus on to others.Fauci said that he and his daughter, who have both been fully vaccinated, still follow the standard social distancing and quarantine guidelines before seeing each other.\"I'm doubly vaccinated. My daughter is doubly vaccinated. The last time she tried to come home, she had to go quarantine for 14 days and get tested,\" he said. \"It was a big, big deal to finally see my daughter in the same room. I think that's going to have to change.\"\"What's the reason to get vaccinated in the first place, if you don't want to get to normal?\" he said.The US has ramped up its genome sequencing efforts in the hunt for  variants, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Monday.\"Over the last three weeks or so we've increased our sequencing about tenfold,\" Walensky said during a White House briefing. \"So as we look more, we certainly anticipate we might find more\" variants. The US effort in genetic sequencing lags far behind many other developed nations. One analysis ranked the US  for sequences per 1,000 cases of Covid-19.Scientists search for coronavirus mutations by taking samples of the virus from patients' nasal swabs and analyzing their genetic sequences.Mutations are changes in the genetic code of a virus that occur naturally over time when an animal or person is infected -- and such mutations can lead to the emergence of new variants.\"We anticipate that we're probably going to be sequencing up to three to four more than we are already sequencing,\" Walensky said. \"I think once we have more sequencing that's happening, we'll have a better idea as to how many variants there are and what proportion are out there.\"Walensky said during the briefing that she was \"reluctant\" to provide an estimate of how many coronavirus variant cases there could be based on the current data. She also warned that variants could reverse encouraging declines in Covid-19 statistics.Walensky said an average of 119,900 new cases were reported between January 31 and February 6 -- a drop of nearly 20% from the prior week. New Covid-19 hospitalizations dropped about 17% from the week prior, she said.\"The continued proliferation of variants remains of great concern and is a threat that could reverse the recent positive trends we are seeing,\" she said.Right now 699 variant cases have been confirmed across 34 states -- 690 of the variant first discovered in the United Kingdom, she said. Experts say the highly contagious UK variant will likely soon become dominant in the US, and may already be occurring. On Sunday, the US surpassed 27 million reported infections and more than 464,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than 32.3 million Americans have so far received at least their first dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, according to CDC data, as officials work to increase vaccinations across the country.And a third vaccine could be on its way to the US market soon: Johnson & Johnson asked the Food and Drug Administration of its vaccine last week. New Covid-19 cases among nursing home residents and staff have dropped more than 50% in about four weeks, according to a CNN analysis of the latest data published by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The data captured cases reported between the week ending December 20 and the week ending January 24.A separate analysis by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living found that cases have dropped twice as fast in those nursing homes that vaccinated residents and staff.The , published last week, assessed 797 facilities that held vaccination clinics in the federal Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program between December 18 and 27 and 1,709 facilities in the same set of counties that did not have a clinic in that time.\"The decline in new cases three weeks after the first dose, compared to facilities having vaccine clinics later, is encouraging and signals that the vaccine may decrease the spread of COVID, a finding not shown in the trials,\" said Dr. David Gifford, chief medical officer for AHCA/NCAL.Gifford said additional data is needed to verify the reason behind the decrease.\"If verified with additional data, this could expedite the reopening of long term care facilities to visitors, which is vital to residents' health and well-being,\" he said.With the potential for more infectious variants to become dominant, officials are trying to get more people vaccinated quickly.The pace of vaccinations across the United States has picked up, according to the CDC. In the past seven days, an average of more than 1.5 million people have received vaccine shots each day.Many communities have increased the number of places people can get shots. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a plan to vaccinate seniors who are veterans of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion in their homes.\"We are inspired by folks that have been willing to stand up and fight for freedom,\" DeSantis said.The move expands the state's program to vaccinate homebound seniors, which began recently with Holocaust survivors.\"We're not going to rest until every senior that wants a shot gets a shot,\" DeSantis said.  Mitigation measures will play an especially key role in , an expert said Sunday, as the CDC is expected to soon release guidelines on how schools can open during the pandemic. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, told CBS that when it comes to reopening schools, \"the prerequisite is putting in place mitigation steps ... \"He noted that when people wore masks and stayed socially distant, there was \"very little transmission within the classroom.\"And while it would be good to prioritize , he said, \"I don't think it's necessarily a prerequisite. I think schools have demonstrated that they can open safely if they've taken precautions in the classroom.\" About 62,000 New York City middle school students who opted for in-person learning will be returning to the classroom February 25, according Danielle Filson, a spokeswoman for the city's education department. Teachers and staff will return the day before to prepare.Those teachers returning to the classroom are being prioritized for vaccine access at city hubs from February 12 to 21 and over midwinter recess, said Education Chancellor Richard Carranza.US Rep.

{"text": "Antigen test results still are not included in the total count of Covid-19 cases for some states -- not even as probable cases, as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends.Five states -- California, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri and Nevada -- publicly report only cases confirmed with PCR tests in their online tallies, according to a CNN analysis of health department dashboards across all 50 states. Some states only report polymerase chain reaction test results in their Covid-19 case numbers and exclude antigen test results since antigen tests are generally seen as less accurate. But as antigen testing ramps up in the United States, this exclusion could lead to potential miscounts.\"Antigen tests are relatively inexpensive, and most can be used at the point of care. Most of the currently authorized tests return results in approximately 15 minutes,\" according to the , but also notes it's generally less sensitive than other types of tests.In California, for instance, CNN was told that antigen Covid-19 test results are required to be reported to local health departments and to the California Department of Public Health. But publicly reported Covid-19 testing data only reflects results from diagnostic tests that detect the coronavirus's genetic material, such as PCR -- polymerase chain reaction -- tests.CNN requested antigen testing data from the state's department of public health, but was told in an email that \"antigen test results are not being publicly reported statewide at this time.\"Across the four remaining states, the data they each shared with CNN represent about 10,000 positive Covid-19 antigen test results reported over just a small sampling of days in January.If included in reported case counts, those positive antigen test results would increase Covid-19 cases reported by those states between 5% and 50% in that time, according to CNN's analysis.In Maryland, 3,522 positive antigen tests were reported to the Maryland Department of Health between January 23 and January 29, the department told CNN in an email. That averages out to be about 503 positive antigen tests per day not included in  of cases.In Nevada, 7,764 antigen tests total were reported to the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services between January 21 and 27, according to a document from the department's Office of Analytics. Among those tests, 623 were positive. In Nevada, state counts are based on \"molecular tests only,\" with the exception of the Nevada Department of Corrections, which antigen test among people who are currently incarcerated.In Colorado, between January 25 and 31, there were 10,203 total antigen test encounters per day, 527 of those were positive, according to the Colorado State Emergency Operations Center. The department told CNN in an email that the seven-day average positivity for antigen tests in that past week was 5.17%.In Missouri, during the week of January 10, a total of 50,113 antigen tests were reported to the Department of Health, according to data obtained by CNN. Among those tests, 5,285 were positive.Public  that while antigen tests are usually faster and cheaper than typical PCR tests, antigen tests are \"more likely to miss\" an active Covid-19 infection compared to PCR testing. Due to this difference in accuracy, some states choose to only report Covid-19 cases confirmed with PCR testing.In June, at least  to report antigen test results as \"probable\" cases in Covid-19 case counts. While the number is now much smaller, some experts worry that in the future, not publicly reporting \"probable\" cases could paint a skewed portrait of the true spread of disease for residents in a state.\"Antigen-based tests are not necessarily the majority of all the tests that are being performed everywhere and so it's unlikely that we're getting a dramatically wrong estimate, as of right now -- also because most states are reporting them. But there is the risk going forward,\" Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at , told CNN last week.\"I think that more and more of these antigen based tests are being used,\" he said. \"So there's certainly a risk going forward that if these are not reported consistently, that we're going to see an underestimate of the number of Covid cases in the country, and particularly in those states that are not reporting them.\"More rapid antigen tests are expected in the United States as last week,  that the Department of Defense and Department of Health and Human Services are working with Australian company Ellume to provide more of its fully at-home Covid-19 tests to the United States. The test is an over-the-counter, rapid self-test which detects SARS-CoV-2 antigen. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus that causes Covid-19.While antigen tests work by detecting a protein that is part of the novel coronavirus, PCR tests work by detecting genetic material of the virus called RNA.For antigen tests, \"proteins are shorter lived in the body and so there can be more false negatives from these tests,\" Dr. Elizabeth McNally, director of the Center for Genetic Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, wrote in an email to CNN.\"Antigen tests are routinely used for detecting other viruses, and we know they also have false positives and false negatives,\" she added.Because PCR tests are typically highly accurate, they do not need repeat testing. For antigen tests, however, \"positive results are usually highly accurate, but false positives can happen, especially in areas where very few people have the virus,\" according to the . Negative results may need to be confirmed with a PCR test. Since antigen tests are more likely to report false negative results than false positive results, \"the concern is more so that there might be people who have Covid who are missed by these antigen-based tests, but not that they're creating false positives,\" Dowdy said. He added that it is estimated  of people who have Covid-19.\"So if what you're primarily tracking is the percent of your tests that are positive, then including the antigen-based tests creates a risk of underestimating the percent positive,\" Dowdy said. \"But if you're looking at the total number -- which is, in general, what more people are looking at -- then by excluding people who are testing positive, you basically have people who have confirmed Covid-19 who are not being counted.\"In some states, antigen test results may be included in total case counts as \"probable cases,\" but not included in the percent positivity of tests, which tracks the percentage of all coronavirus tests performed in a state that are actually positive.For instance, in Hawaii, \"Antigen tests are counted as probable cases, rather than as confirmed cases,\" Brooks Baehr, a spokesperson for the Hawaii State Department of Health, told CNN in an email. But \"for testing percent positivity, antigen tests are not included in our tallies because we are lacking accurate counts of total number of antigen tests performed in our state.\"\"It seems strange\" to not include antigen test results in statewide counts of Covid-19 cases, Northwestern University's McNally said in her email.In the tallies, \"combining PCR and antigen might improve sensitivity and specificity of testing, but overall the testing we have works reasonably well, so I don't think this is really necessary,\" McNally said. \"We know there are many more cases of Covid-19 than what is reported.\"The most important take-away, Dowdy said, is that Covid-19 testing needs to continue and remains an important tool in responding to the pandemic.\"The more testing we do the better,\" said Dowdy, of Johns Hopkins University. \"It's better for people to know if they have this disease or not,\" he said. \"It's also important for the public health agencies to know how many people have Covid-19 in a given place -- and so we should be trying to ramp up testing, both of PCR and of the antigen based tests, and making sure that we report those as completely as possible.\"CNN's Virginia Langmaid and Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.", "summary": "Antigen test results still are not included in the total count of Covid-19 cases for some states -- not even as probable cases, as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends."},

A little bit of stress is good, and essential for survival, but severe or prolonged stress can increase the risk for , including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, Alzheimer's disease, cancer and others. Chronic stress is thought to contribute to  throughout the body that plays a critical role in the onset and progression of stress-related disease, along with elevated levels of the hormone cortisol.  \"Some concerns with consistently high levels of cortisol include elevated blood glucose levels, weight gain, increased appetite, GI issues, hypertension, and suppression of the immune system,\" explained Felicia Porrazza, a Philadelphia-based  who helps stressed-out clients find natural ways to improve their overall wellness.   Dr. Caroline Messer, a New York City-based endocrinologist, always talks to her patients about managing stress. \"It's unbelievably important for their sense of wellbeing,\" she said.\"Often when patients come in with hair loss, fatigue and insomnia, they assume there's a direct hormonal underpinning, but these symptoms can actually be stress-mediated with a secondary increase in cortisol levels,\" Messer said.Here's how to start making healthy changes to reduce your stress levels. Meditation practice leads to decreased physiological markers of stress in a range of populations, according to  of 45 studies. Specifically, meditation can help to lower cortisol levels, blood pressure and heart rate.A  also helps us better respond to stressful situations, according to Ellie Burrows Gluck, a Vedic meditation teacher and the co-founder and CEO of , a meditation studio in New York City that also offers live-streamed, at-home practices with meditation experts at .To meditate, simply bring your , inhaling and exhaling through the nose. When your mind starts to wander, come back to your breath without judgment.  If you would like some support for your meditation practice, a guided meditation app can help you get started. Martha McKittrick, a New York City-based  who provides nutrition counseling and wellness coaching to many stressed-out clients, likes Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer and Buddhify.That can mean practicing an instrument, painting, cooking or playing with your children. \"I think anything that takes you away from day-to-day concerns is helpful for lowering stress levels,\" Messer said. \"The key is to focus on what you are doing to block out the rest of what is going on. I play classical piano, and I love to bake with my kids ... and (when I engage in these activities), I forget about the pandemic and work stressors.\"Engaging in regular physical activity is a great way to help manage stress and strengthen your immune system, too. Aerobic exercise, which increases heart rate and the body's use of oxygen, boosts levels of endorphins, which work directly on opiate receptors in your brain to reduce pain and boost pleasure, Messer explained. Exercise also reduces levels of the body's stress hormones, specifically adrenaline and cortisol, explained MaryAnn Browning, founder and CEO of  in a previous . Messer advises patients to engage in aerobic exercise for 30 minutes, three times per week. \"Aerobic exercise allows the muscle and liver to remove glucose from the bloodstream, increases metabolism, and can improve sleep patterns.\"  Try riding on a stationary bike or simply taking a brisk walk. \"As long as you are pushing yourself,\" Messer said. And if you don't want to go outside, you can just walk around in circles in your apartment while you talk to people, according to Browning, who added that she is able to get up to 23,000 steps in a day by walking and conversing at the same time.Foods like salmon, trout, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring are a rich source of  known as DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid).Vitamin C-rich foods, like red and green peppers, oranges, grapefruit and kiwi, may be helpful in lowering psychological stress and blood pressure, according to .And fermented foods like yogurt, kombucha, kefir, tempeh and sauerkraut contain friendly bacteria known as , which have the ability to reduce stress and cortisol levels.Limiting calories to very low levels has been shown to .  \"If you are cutting back on calories too much in attempts to lose your 'pandemic weight,' you may actually be doing your body harm,\" McKittrick said.Eating enough carbohydrates is important, too, since they prompt the brain to make serotonin, a neurotransmitter that has a calming effect in the body, according to McKittrick. On the flip side, diets that are very low in carbs can boost cortisol levels, she explained.It's also important to avoid long stretches without food. Doing so can cause drops in blood sugar, which can cause irritability and worsen stress, according to McKittrick. Try to eat something every four hours or so.High amounts of caffeine can boost cortisol levels and intensify the effects of stress on the body, McKittrick explained. It's important to pay attention to how your body reacts to caffeine; you might need to cut back or try herbal tea instead if you are feeling stressed.  Sleep deprivation can contribute to higher stress levels, and stress can also contribute to poor sleep quality, ultimately compounding stress.Aiming for  is key, as it helps to decrease cortisol and your adrenal load.If you have trouble getting that amount of sleep, taking two naps that are no longer than 30 minutes each — one in the morning and one in the afternoon — has been shown to help decrease stress and offset the negative effects that sleep deprivation has on the immune system.If you find you need additional support, meeting with a sleep psychologist can help in establishing healthy sleep/wake cycles, Messer said.    has shown that yoga can help in reducing cortisol levels and blood pressure.   Engaging in a regular yoga practice has helped me to reduce my stress levels. My girls and I love the YouTube channel  and have made it part of our bedtime routine! \"I recommend acupuncture to my patients when other avenues have failed ... and a lot of patients swear by it,\" Messer said.  Feeling calmer and sleeping better are some of the touted benefits, she explained. Getting outside and spending some time in nature can help relieve stress, improve your mood and boost feelings of happiness and well-being, according to the .

{"text": "It's the second week in February, a time of year when influenza is usually sweeping across the country.Yet this year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports, there's very little influenza activity.The CDC's across the US is often a sea of red during the first half of February -- red meaning cases are high and increasing. Yet for the entire flu season so far this year, the map has been a reassuring wash of green -- indicating little to no flu activity.Lynette Brammer, who heads the CDC's domestic flu surveillance program, is not ready to declare victory yet.\"I'd hold off for a little while longer before saying we are completely out of the woods,\" Brammer told CNN. \"Flu can do odd things.\"But the numbers are compelling. , the CDC reported widespread flu activity in nearly every US region, with \"high\" activity in 45 states. In an average year, hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized with flu. So far this flu season, just 155 people confirmed to have influenza have ended up in the hospital.\"Right now, there is nowhere in the country that we are seeing a real uptick in flu. It is pretty much very, very low everywhere,\" Brammer said.And 78 children had died of flu at this point last year. This year, just one pediatric flu death has been reported. \"Flu activity is unusually low at this time but may increase in the coming months,\" the CDC says on its website.It would be no surprise if the precautions many Americans are taking to prevent the spread of coronavirus were also preventing the spread of flu. Influenza and other respiratory viruses, including coronavirus, spread in similar ways -- on tiny particles of mucus and saliva that spew out when people cough, sneeze, talk and even breathe.These particles fall onto surfaces where people can pick them up on their hands or fingers and transfer to those nose, mouth or eyes. They can also remain suspended in the air and spread in poorly ventilated rooms. Or they can spray directly from one person or another.Staying apart, wearing masks and avoiding crowded indoor situations can all help slow the spread, as can frequent handwashing.\"It is likely that measures taken to slow or prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 have had an impact on the spread of other pathogens, including influenza. Measures, including extensive reductions in global travel, teleworking, school closures, social distancing, and face mask use may have played a role,\" the CDC says. \"Less travel likely played a role.\"Each year, hundreds of different viruses cause flu-like symptoms among people. They include influenza, but also viruses such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenzavirus, metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus or RSV. Then there are the common, garden variety coronaviruses.\"While flu has been really low, all the other respiratory viruses other than Covid have been really low, too,\" Brammer said. \"There has been a little bit of rhinovirus, but that is about it.\"The CDC stressed the need for vaccination against flu, and is preparing figures now on how many Americans got vaccinated against flu this season. But each year, only about half the people who should get flu vaccines actually get them. The CDC recommends everyone from the age of 6 months up get one, with a few exceptions.And it's not too late to get a flu shot, Brammer noted.While there's evidence that people are not seeking the right medical care in many cases because of fear of catching the coronavirus in a hospital or clinic, or out of worry they'll stress an already overwhelmed medical system, Brammer believes flu testing is accurately capturing the spread -- or lack thereof.\"There is probably a little higher amount of testing than you would normally see in a low flu season,\" she said. It's good news on more than one level. Doctors had been very worried that flu and coronavirus would both circulate over the winter. People can be infected with two viruses at once - and that would be serious. But because flu also puts people into the hospital, it would have meant even more pressure on an already stretched system.One thing is for sure, the CDC says. Flu can surprise you.It varies greatly from one year to another, and the CDC and infects anywhere between 9.3 million and 45 million people a year. Flu kills anywhere between 12,000 and 61,000 people a year and puts anywhere between 140,000 and 810,000 into the hospital.Some years, flu season starts early -- in September or October. Other years, it can come later, only picking up steam in January and February. Sometimes there are two waves of flu and often one strain will hit early and a second strain will hit later -- sometimes as late as April.Brammer said there is some evidence flu activity is picking up in parts of Asia that have eased the restrictions meant to control coronavirus.\"When they loosen up on those measures, flu comes back,\" she said.Influenza circulates year round -- it's usually only at very low levels in the summer, but there are no rules.\"I think I'll stay on the edge of my seat,\" she said. \"Flu could start to happen. Keep your eyes open.\"", "summary": "There's hardly any flu this year. Coronavirus restrictions may be responsible, the CDC says.

{"text": "Lawrence Wetsit misses the days when his people would gather by the hundreds and sing the songs that all Assiniboine children are expected to learn by age 15.\"We can't have ceremony without memorizing all of the songs, songs galore,\" he said. \"We're not supposed to record them: We have to be there. And when that doesn't happen in my grandchildren's life, they may never catch up.\"Such ceremonial gatherings have been scarce over the past year as Native American communities like Wetsit's isolate to protect their elders during the Covid-19 pandemic. Reservations have been hit especially hard, with Native Americans nearly  as white people. Wetsit, a tribal elder and former chair of the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes, said that his tribe lost one person a day on average to the disease during October and November.These deaths are doubly devastating to Native communities because elders are seen as the keepers of tribal history and culture. Wetsit worries that the combination of deaths and lockdowns will permanently harm the tribe's ability to share traditional knowledge and oral history.\"Our grandchildren will feel it in their generation,\" he said. \"It's like taking a number of pages of their textbook and ripping it out and throwing it away.\"With that in mind, many Native people have found innovative ways throughout the pandemic to continue sharing their culture despite physical distancing restrictions. Social media groups have provided some remedies, in ways that may continue after the pandemic wanes.\"If there was ever a time where we could see how interconnected our world is, that time is now,\" said Jeneda Benally, a musician and member of the Navajo tribe in Arizona.One Facebook group, known as , has helped its Native members connect through sharing videos of drumming, dancing and other traditions. Since its founding in March, the group has accumulated more than 227,000 members and taken on a life of its own, with people sharing prayer requests, birthday celebrations and death announcements.\"We didn't expect it to take off like it did,\" said the group's co-founder Dan Simonds, an artist based in Bozeman, Montana, and a member of the Pequot tribe. \"It showed how much something like this was needed.\"For group members who rarely leave their isolated reservations, the videos provide an opportunity to see other tribes' homes and traditions for the first time. \"Every tribe is different, like every European country,\" Simonds said.The group has provided a platform to talk about important issues. In January, organizers hosted a  with a doctor, nurses and community representatives who could answer group members' questions about Covid vaccines. Skepticism about the safety of vaccination tends to be high among Native Americans, and more than 9,500 people viewed the event. \"People are listening and learning,\" Simonds said.Simonds expects the group will continue after the pandemic ends, and he has created a nonprofit spinoff that plans to hold in-person powwows once it is safe. \"This is one of the first times in history we have our own space by Natives where Natives can be heard,\" he said.Among other powwow events that have seen an online resurgence is the , an Ojibwe tradition usually performed by groups of women wearing skirts adorned with tinkling metal bells. Women from various tribes have been posting Instagram videos of themselves dancing alone at home., an Ojibwe historian at the University of Minnesota, is not surprised that the dance has become so popular during the pandemic. \"Most women and young girls are very aware that that is a healing tradition,\" she said.According to legend, jingle dress dancing arose during the 1918 flu pandemic when a father with a sick little girl dreamed of a healing dance and had the dresses made for four women in his tribe. The girl recovered and became one of the first jingle dress dancers.Child said the jingle dress tradition resonates because it is supposed to heal both the body and the mind during a time when fear and grief are rampant. \"Ojibwe have always been aware there's this psychological aspect to disease,\" she said.But some traditions are more difficult to share online, particularly those that rely on oral stories told by elders. Internet access can be scarce on remote reservations, and many older people struggle to use technologies like video chat. \"It's hard enough for our communities and elders to transmit that information to the next generation, but trying to find a way to do that with social distancing in this era is especially hard,\" said Clayson Benally, Jeneda's brother.Since the Benallys' band, Sihasin, can't tour during the pandemic, the siblings have been performing online. They are also making instructional  of traditional Navajo practices such as shearing sheep and harvesting medicinal plants.\"This is my desperate attempt to ensure that our culture continues to exist,\" said Jeneda Benally. \"Even though we're losing people, this knowledge still exists. I don't want our people to sink into a depression.\"Some practices are too sacred to share online, she said. Tribal members must walk a fine line between keeping people engaged and revealing privileged information to outsiders at the risk of cultural appropriation. Certain rituals, symbols and stories are meant to be shared only orally — many tribes forbid members from even writing them down.\"It's tricky because we have to be very cautious,\" said Clayson Benally. \"Our ancestors would never have imagined we're teaching our ways through these airwaves that exist.\"Many Indigenous languages are in danger of disappearing forever, as speakers tend to be elderly and in fragile health. The pandemic has accelerated the threat.\"It's the equivalent of having jumped forward 10 years and lost speakers that would have been with us still but now are gone,\" said Wilhelm Meya, CEO of the nonprofit  (TLC).Meya's organization preserves Indigenous languages through recordings, dictionaries, dubbed movies and lessons — mostly developed by sending linguists to visit Native speakers around the world. After the pandemic began, TLC set up computer terminals in unused schools and community centers on reservations. While staffers control the desktops remotely, language speakers and their families can visit the stations alone and record words.By setting up six such terminals on the Crow reservation in Montana, TLC completed a four-year effort to develop an  app. Similar projects are underway with tribes in Wisconsin, Washington and other states.Meya said the strategy worked so well that TLC will continue using it after the pandemic to record Native languages in remote areas like Alaska and Australia. The nonprofit plans to offer more online lessons: Being stuck at home has led to a surge of interest among Native people in learning their historical languages, he said.To Wetsit, the knowledge that Native Americans' culture and communities have persisted through centuries of adversity suggests they will survive this crisis.\"If you've had cultural teachings, they'll help you remember that things will get better and it gives you hope,\" he said. \"I think that our people realize that our culture can be changed a little bit without great harm.

{"text": "Forget which comes first, the chicken or the egg. The more important question is: Are eggs good or bad for your health?Unfortunately, science can't seem to settle on a definitive answer to that either. Just last year, a  of 215,000 people found that eating one egg per day was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.Now, a new study of over 500,000 people has found eating even a portion of a whole egg -- with its cholesterol-laden yellow yoke -- increases the risk of dying from all causes, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. In fact, the overall risk of death went up by 7% for each additional half a whole egg eaten per day, .Experts were skeptical. \"Despite many years of research this question about eggs and health has not been answered, with multiple observational studies over the last few decades showing conflicting results -- some suggesting moderate egg intake is good, while others suggesting it may be bad,\" said Riyaz Patel, a consultant cardiologist at University College London.\"This study, although well conducted, unfortunately only adds more noise to the discussion,\" Patel said in a statement.The study results are problematic because they only asked people once about their egg consumption, then followed them for many years without checking to see if their diet had changed, said , a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\"They're only getting a snapshot in time,\" said Willett, who is also a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\"The conclusions of this study are overblown,\" said Ada Garcia, a senior lecturer in public health nutrition at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, in a statement. \"Blaming eggs alone for an increased risk of cardiovascular disease is a simplistic and reductionist approach to the concept of diet and disease prevention.\"The poultry industry has long touted the \"incredible, edible egg.\" For a mere 75 calories, they say, an egg delivers 7 grams of high-quality protein, 5 grams of fat and 1.6 grams of saturated fat, along with iron, vitamins, minerals and disease-fighting nutrients like lutein and zeaxanthin.Eggs are affordable, making them a cheap nutritional powerhouse for families with limited food budgets. Many people on popular low-carb diets such as keto also rely heavily on eggs in their meal plans.The problem, of course, is the level of cholesterol in the yellow yolk of eggs: One large egg yolk can deliver about 185 milligrams of cholesterol.is not a bogeyman. Made by the liver, cholesterol is in every cell in the body and is used to make hormones, vitamin D, digestive compounds and more. Sometimes a person's body can make too much cholesterol, leading to a buildup of waxy plaque in blood vessels and later cardiovascular disease. There is a role played by cholesterol in our diet, but it's more complicated than we used to think, said Willett, who has spent over 40 years studying the effects of diet on the occurrence of major diseases.Nutritional guidelines used to recommend an upper limit of 300 milligrams of cholesterol a day. Today  eating as little as possible by keeping saturated fats to less than 10% of daily calories.The key, Willett said, is to look at the overall nutritional pros and cons of the food, as well as what the food is replacing in the diet.Take fish, for example. Fish contain cholesterol, but also provide essential omega-3 fatty acids critical to optimal health.And saturated fats from butter, whole dairy and fatty cuts of meat have a much more profound impact on raising levels of LDL (low-density lipoproteins) in the blood than sources of dietary cholesterol such as eggs.\"If someone replaces eggs with doughnuts, other refined starches and sugar or saturated fats, I'd rather they eat eggs,\" Willett said. \"But for someone who really wants to be in optimal health. putting the emphasis on plant-based protein sources like steel-cut oatmeal and nuts would be a better way to go.\"Certain populations may want to watch their intake of eggs, however. \"Someone who's having a difficult time having to use medication for their blood cholesterol levels probably would be better off keeping eggs on the low side,\" Willett said. \"Eggs don't have to be totally eliminated, but I think the old recommendation of not more than two eggs per week for most people is actually still a good recommendation.\"People with Type 2 diabetes should be wary as well. The  found a higher intake of eggs by people with Type 2 diabetes was associated with increased cardiovascular risk, a link that has been duplicated in previous studies.Can eggs yolks be safely replaced with egg whites? The new PLOS study found replacing half a whole egg with an equivalent amount of egg whites or egg substitutes reduced death from cardiovascular disease by 3%.\"In my view the recommendation made by the authors to replace whole eggs with egg whites/substitutes is not supported by the entirety of evidence available,\" said UCL's Patel.  \"Most studies have not looked at eggs without yolks,\" Willett said, \"mostly because consumption of egg whites is pretty low in the general population. The lowest risk is replacing eggs with nuts and plant-based sources of protein.\"Patel added: \"I do not think this study changes the general advice, that for most people, eggs can be eaten in moderation as part of a balanced diet, unless they have been advised not to for a specific medical or dietary reason.\"", "summary": "Are eggs good or bad for you?

Based on cases from the past seven days, this would amount to roughly 52,000 to 104,000 sequences a week.\"The recent rise in number of variants detected in the United States is likely due at least in part to our expanded ability to sequence virus samples,\" Walensky noted.A new order by the CDC requiring people to wear masks while riding any kind of public transportation will go into effect at 11:59 p.m. Monday. Airlines and airports will be required to report passengers who disobey the new federal mask mandate to federal authorities, according to documents obtained by CNN.   The directive says failure to comply with the mask rules at an airport \"may result in the removal and denial of re-entry\" of violators.The CDC said public transportation operators must use best efforts to enforce the mandate, such as allowing only those wearing masks to board and disembarking passengers who refuse to comply. The order was signed by Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's . People can take their masks off briefly to eat, drink or take medication; verify their identity to law enforcement or transportation officials; communicate with hearing impaired people; don an oxygen mask on an aircraft; or during a medical emergency, the CDC said.Children younger than 2 or people with a disability who cannot wear a mask are exempt. About 26 million people have received at least one dose of their two-dose vaccines, . About 6 million people have been fully vaccinated with both doses. That's 1.7% of the US population.The storm that is dumping snow across the Northeast is delaying vaccinations there. State-run mass vaccination sites in New York and New Jersey are set to be closed Tuesday due to the winter storm. In Massachusetts, the state Department of Transportation is coordinating with several Covid-19 vaccination sites to \"keep them as accessible as possible for as long as possible,\" Gov. Charlie Baker said.But with new variants spreading, some health experts say the US should go ahead and give first doses to as many people as possible -- even if that might delay second doses for some. \"We still want to get two doses in everyone,\" Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told NBC on Sunday. \"But I think right now, in advance of this surge, we need to get as many one doses in as many people over 65 as we possibly can to reduce serious illness and deaths that are going to occur over the next weeks ahead.\"Osterholm said he's worried about a potential surge caused by , first identified in the UK. That strain has now spread to at least 32 states, according to the CDC.\"The surge that is likely to occur with this new variant from England is going to happen in the next six to 14 weeks,\" Osterholm said. \"And if we see that happen ... we are going to see something like we have not yet seen in this country.\"But some health experts are concerned second doses could be delayed. Recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are supposed to get their second doses 21 days after the first dose, and Moderna vaccine doses are supposed to be spaced 28 days apart. The World Health Organization, Pfizer and Moderna have all said people can wait as long as six weeks between doses. But Pfizer and Moderna said they don't have any data on .While Osterholm's idea is \"admirable, trying to give at least some protection to as many people as possible,\" it also has drawbacks, said William Haseltine, president of .\"First, they may not get fully protected, and that might accelerate the rate of variants taking over and causing us much more trouble in the future,\" said Haseltine, a former professor at Harvard Medical School. \"Secondly, we really don't know if delaying the second dose for a long time is going to give you the same degree of protection.\"Ideally, people should stick to the recommended interval of either three weeks or four weeks, said Fauci, also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\"But if someone who, for one reason or another, is a bit late by a couple of weeks ... there is some wiggle room,\" Fauci said. \"It's not the end of the world if you delay a little bit. If you want to delay it by six months, that's different.\"States should not be holding back doses to give people their second shot, Fauci said.\"The first priority will always be to get the people who have gotten their first doses to get their second doses,\" Fauci said.But \"a dose that's available is going to go into someone's arm. If a person is ready for their second dose, that person will be prioritized.\"Ranney said she hopes increased production can help ensure people can get their second doses in a timely manner.\"We should count on Pfizer and Moderna and  to help fill that gap,\" she said. \"Give everyone the doses that you can right now and count on that increased production so that you can get people adequately protected.\"New York officials acknowledged Monday there's a clear  who have received vaccine doses to date and the city needs to redouble its efforts to address inequitable access.A  Monday highlighted that issue. People in the United States who have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine were most likely to be female, non-Hispanic White and at least 50 years old, according to the report.The CDC collected demographic data from states and other jurisdictions on people who began the vaccination process between December 14 and January 14.Age and gender were identified for nearly all 12.5 million individuals who received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine in the first month of distribution. Of those, about 63% were female and about 55% were at least 50 years old.Race and ethnicity, however, were unknown for about half of the individuals vaccinated. Six jurisdictions did not report any race or ethnicity data. But of those for whom race and ethnicity were identified, about 60% were non-Hispanic White. About 11.5% were Hispanic or Latino, 6% Asian, 5.4% Black, 2% American Indian or Alaskan Native, and less than 1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.The demographic data of those vaccinated against Covid-19 likely reflects the demographics of the people in the Phase 1a priority group, including health care personnel and long-term care facility residents, according to the CDC.Black and Hispanic people have been found to have more severe outcomes from Covid-19, according to CDC, and \"more complete reporting of race and ethnicity data\" is needed to detect and respond to potential disparities in Covid-19 vaccination.Many Americans hope Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine will get emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration this month. That vaccine has been shown to be 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial and 85% effective against severe disease, the company announced Friday. The vaccine was 72% effective against moderate and severe disease in the US.There are two key advantages to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. It requires only one dose, and it can be kept at normal refrigeration temperatures.If the vaccine gets a green light from the FDA in the coming weeks, Johnson & Johnson said it would have fewer than 10 million vaccine doses available, a federal health official told CNN.The number of doses available would be in the single-digit millions and that number would ramp up to 20 or 30 million doses by April, the official said. CNN has reached out to Johnson & Johnson for comment.The US government is working with the Australian company Ellume to provide more of its fully at-home Covid-19 tests to the United States, the Biden administration said Monday. The company has been ramping up manufacturing and will ship 100,000 test kits per month to the US from February through July, said Andy Slavitt, senior White House adviser for Covid-19 response.With a new $230 million contract, Ellume will \"be able to scale their production to manufacture more than 19 million test kits per month by the end of this year, 8.5 million of which are guaranteed to the US government,\" Slavitt said.The Ellume test can detect Covid-19 with 95% accuracy in about 15 minutes, he said.CNN's Kaitlan Collins, Andrea Diaz, Maggie Fox, Deidre McPhillips, Michael Nedelman, Ganesh Setty, Naomi Thomas and Greg Wallace contributed to this report.

{"text": "Over 4.6 million US adults have a peanut allergy — and many of them developed the allergy in adulthood, a new study has found.Over 800,000 of those adults — over 17% — developed their allergy after turning 18 years old, according to a study published Tuesday in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.A peanut allergy has generally been thought of as a pediatric issue, but more adults than children have the allergy, said study author Dr. Ruchi Gupta, director of the Center for Food Allergy and Asthma Research at Northwestern University in Illinois. But only 15% to 20% of children with a peanut allergy will outgrow their allergy by adulthood, according to the study. Adults who reported developing a peanut allergy in adulthood were significantly less likely to get diagnosed by a physician compared to adults who reported developing the allergy as a child, according to the survey of over 40,000 US adults. Gupta said she has noticed adults who have a negative reaction to a certain food tend to avoid eating it rather than following up with an allergy test. When you get diagnosed with a peanut allergy, you receive confirmation that you are allergic, which affects how you live your life, she said.Of the 2.9% of US adults who reported having a peanut allergy, only 1.8% — that's 4.6 million people — had a convincing peanut allergy, according to the study. Convincing symptoms included vomiting, hives and trouble breathing among others, said study author Christopher Warren, research consultant at the Center for Food Allergy and Asthma Research. Some examples of symptoms that were not convincing included bloating and diarrhea, he said. Adults who self-diagnose are also potentially placing an unnecessary burden on themselves of avoiding peanuts when they don't have to, Warren added.\"They could be living their life as if their next bite could lead to a very bad outcome when it's something that would be so easy to avoid\" through routine allergy testing, Warren said.  Another reason it's important to get diagnosed is because physicians can prescribe epinephrine, Gupta said, which is an emergency treatment for anaphylaxis, a severe reaction to an allergen. Only 44% of adults with an adult-onset peanut allergy reported having an epinephrine prescription compared to 56% of adults with a childhood-onset peanut allergy, according to the study. There is no known reason why peanut allergies develop in adults, but a person's environment or hormones could play a role, Gupta said. She said research is being done to see if a change in a person's living environment or a fluctuation in women's hormones when they enter puberty or menopause could cause an allergy. This study revealed that peanut allergies in adults are much more prevalent than anticipated, said Bruce Roberts, chief research strategy and innovation officer at Food Allergy Research & Education, who was not involved in the study.If you suspect you have a peanut allergy, Roberts recommended seeing your primary care doctor to get tested. In addition to peanuts, he says you should be tested for other common allergens like tree nuts. Adults with an adult-onset peanut allergy were more likely to report multiple allergies compared to adults with a childhood-onset peanut allergy, according to the study.The Food and Drug Administration has not approved any peanut allergy therapy for adults, Warren said, but there is one therapy for children ages 4 to 17. The therapy slowly desensitizes the children to peanuts, which allows them to ingest the peanut protein and have a milder reaction or none at all, according to the study. Another benefit of being diagnosed as an adult is you can participate in peanut allergy therapy trials, Warren said. Clinical trials are an important part of the process to getting peanut allergy therapies approved for adults, he said.

Although there is a consensus that the  for most cancer patients, according to the American Cancer Society and others in the medical community, research into whether they will be  for cancer patients is still a data-free zone.The  that cancer patients talk to their doctors before getting any type of vaccine because all patients and their courses of treatment are different.There are several factors that may require a cancer patient to delay vaccination, including recent stem cell transplants or other recent use of therapy agents known to reduce vaccine efficacy, according to Dr. Laura Makaroff, the American Cancer Society's Senior Vice President for Prevention and Early Detection.\"As far as safety of the vaccine, every situation for every patient with cancer is a little different. And there's a spectrum of where any one patient might be in their cancer journey,\" Makaroff told CNN. \"The Covid-19 vaccine is definitely safe for people with cancer but it's important that patients have a conversation with their healthcare provider and their cancer care team to determine when is the right time to have the vaccine.\"\"All the guidance that we're seeing -- the American Cancer society and other leading oncology groups -- is that Covid-19 immunization is recommended for patients in active therapy, but we really understand that there are limited safety and efficacy data on these patients,\" Makaroff said.Even with limited data, many cancer experts, medical groups, and doctors are making a big push for vaccinating most cancer patients -- especially those cancer patients .\"The potential benefits far outweigh the risks,\" said Dr. Brian Koffman, chief medical officer for , a group that represents patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the most common adult form of leukemia in the western world. \"Despite the lack of safety data specifically in patients with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), SARS-Cov-2 vaccination is anticipated to be safe.\"Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who develop symptomatic Covid-19 have an 89% risk of hospitalization, Koffman told CNN, based on aLeukemia. CLL is characterized by a weakened immune system. The immunocompromization is so severe that CLL patients are advised to avoid live vaccines such as the ones for measles or yellow fever. And a weakened immune system also means these cancer patients have an due to Covid-19, according to Dr. Chaitra Ujjani, a physician at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and oncology professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine. The, conducted by the European Research Initiative on CLL, found that the mortality rate for CLL patients with symptomatic coronavirus was 31%.\"The thing that people don't quite realize is that the impaired immune system in CLL patients -- due to the disease or some of the treatments for the disease -- can actually impact your response to vaccination,\" Ujjani told CNN. \"We recommend the Covid-19 vaccines for our patients ... but we're not really sure how effective it's going to be,\" she added. \"Patients with blood cancers are typically excluded from the clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of the vaccine.\"To remedy the lack of data, Ujjani is launching a research study involving 500 CLL patients across the country -- all of whom are already slated to receive the vaccine from their doctor or pharmacist -- to determine what kind of immune response they will have to the commercially available vaccines. The study, which is a collaboration between more than 10 medical institutions, will be the first of its kind and may bring more clarity for The  is conducting similar trials for other cancer types, including certain immune system and blood cancers, Ujjani said.Advocacy groups for other more prevalent types of cancer are also encouraging cancer patients to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The Lung Cancer Action Network recently asked the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to give lung cancer patients expedited access to the vaccines. \"Because COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory condition, this disease presents a unique challenge to , who are at extremely high risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19,\" said the group The scientific community agrees that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines in cancer patients -- and many doctors are working around the clock to get more trials off the ground. \"We need these data so that we can better inform patients and better prioritize the allocation of the vaccines. If these vulnerable patients form an adequate immune response, we should certainly vaccinate them as early as possible,\" Dr. Elad Sharon, senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute, told CNN via email. \"But, if research efforts show that these patients fail to form a protective response to these vaccines, then what we will need to do will be to vaccinate everyone around these patients first, so that our medically vulnerable patients are most protected by the people living with them and caring for them.\"Ujjani added, \"We're all working really hard to answer this question, but it's hard because we've been working kind of against the clock as the vaccines just became available.\"\"A lot of our patients have suffered in isolation and fear, and they're not sure they're going to get back to a normal life,\" Ujjani told CNN. \"So every oncologist is interested to see how their patients will respond to the vaccine.\"", "summary": "Many cancer experts, medical groups, and doctors are making a big push for vaccinating most cancer patients -- especially those cancer patients most at risk during the pandemic.

Now, however, after nearly a year of the Covid-19 pandemic, one elusive characteristic is beginning to transcend all others for her: vaccination status.It's not that Jablow is picky; the 34-year-old winemaker from Napa, California, has been on about a half dozen Zoom dates and several in-real-life dates since she ended her last long-term relationship in June. This time around, however, the entire search is different; she received her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in late January, and she's looking for a partner who is either vaccinated or interested in getting vaccinated soon.\"It's all about the vaccine for me now,\" said Jablow, who was vaccinated early because of her job in California's agriculture industry. \"I'm pretty straightforward about it: I believe in science, and if someone isn't interested (in the vaccine) or they don't believe in (vaccines in general), I'm done.\"Jablow certainly isn't the only vaccinated single person looking for safer dating these days.Matchmakers have reported seeing intense demand for partners who have received both doses of the Pfizer or Moderna shots. Dating sites have recorded dramatic upticks in mentions of the word vaccine. Even if you eavesdrop on masked and distanced hangouts at public parks, it seems everyone is desperately seeking someone who has gotten injected.\"Getting vaccinated or being open to getting it is the hottest thing you could do right now,\" said Michael Kaye, spokesperson for the dating site OKCupid.OKCupid users view vaccines as the \"light at the end of the tunnel,\" Kaye said. \"It's not only good for your health and safety to be open to getting the vaccine, but it's good for your dating life as well.\" The recent spikes in demand make perfect sense. As health care systems administer dose after dose of Covid vaccines — as of February 8,  have been administered in the US — those who get vaccinated are far less likely to fall ill with Covid-19.  No, getting the shots isn't a magic bullet; researchers currently are trying to determine the extent to which vaccine recipients can transmit the virus. But their efficacy rates are high. Vaccination clearly has benefits, and in the world of dating, those benefits are in . Exactly how much interest is vaccination status generating these days? That depends on whom you ask for information.At OKCupid, Kaye said he saw a 25% increase in mentions of \"vaccine\" on site profiles over the month of January, and a 63% increase between November and January. He added that users who answer \"Yes\" to a standard profile question, \"Will you get the Covid-19 vaccine?\" are being \"liked\" at a rate of up to 25% higher than those who answer \"No\" or choose not to answer.Other dating sites reported even more encouraging stats.Dating site Tinder recorded an astronomical 258% increase in profile mentions of the word \"vaccine\" between September and December of last year, said Dana Balch, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles-based company.\"What this tells me is that the notion of becoming immune to the virus has sparked conversation around a cultural moment that's on everyone's mind,\" she said. \"We expect interest (in vaccines) only to grow.\"Admittedly, at this stage of vaccine rollout, these numbers can be a bit skewed. Most of the people who have been vaccinated are health care professionals, first responders, essential workers and people over the ages of 65 or 70. In most of these cases, people are likely too busy or anxious to prioritize dating right now.Bela Gandhi, dating coach and founder of , a matchmaking service in Chicago, said that as more people get vaccines and share photos of themselves getting shots on social media, the more important vaccination status will become.\"I think there are going to be seismic shifts in the way we think about this,\" she said.Gandhi envisioned a scenario where single people declare Covid-19 vaccination status the same way some declare they are taking prophylactic medication to prevent the transmission of HIV.\"Dating is about developing an emotional connection and making sure a person doesn't have red flags,\" she continued. \"Knowing that someone has gotten a Covid vaccine certainly eliminates one of the biggest red flags of the time.\"Technically speaking, Gandhi is correct — on the most basic level, vaccination status indicates whether a prospective paramour received the shot. On another level, a person's willingness to broadcast vaccination status reveals a lot about that person's morality and their relationship to issues such as science, politics and the greater good.Vaccination status is a way of \"understanding someone's relationship to trusted institutions,\" said Jennifer Reich, professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Denver. Vaccines mark a certain faith in public health and desire to participate in community solutions, she said, noting this can be important to people in the same way that certain kinds of causes have been important in dating over time.\"People seek people who share their values, and this could be its own symbolic marker,\" said Reich, who has specialized in researching attitudes about vaccinations for years.The Covid-19 vaccine allows you to control your own exposure to the virus, but beyond contributing to eventual herd immunity, it says little about your willingness to control the exposure of others, said Rachel DeAlto, chief dating officer at Match.com.\"The vaccine is about protecting yourself, while masks are about protecting other people,\" she said. \"The conversation about masks is more difficult.\"DeAlto added that post-vaccination dating, like Covid-era dating overall, comes down to risk tolerance.\"Someone who gets vaccinated might say, 'I'll take that chance and start making out with people again,'\" she explained. \"Others will not be comfortable unless they have double protection between them and the person they're dating. Before you get back out there, you need to figure out where you stand, and be very clear about it from the beginning.\"The flip side of this equation is that when two vaccinated people get together, the risks to them are almost nil, said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician in Baltimore and visiting professor of public health at George Washington University in Washington, DC.\"If your grandparents have been vaccinated and they want to meet for dinner with their neighbors, so long as the neighbors also have been vaccinated, they can have dinner indoors because they're not a danger to each other,\" Wen said. \"The same applies to dating — when you date someone else who's fully vaccinated there's very minimal danger to both parties involved.\"Whatever value we place on vaccination, it's important to remember that current .First, both current vaccines require two shots, and even then, they take a couple weeks to work. Second, in the absence of an official vaccination card or a social media photo, it might be difficult for people to prove to potential partners that they have received the shot.Third — and perhaps most important — while the vaccines have proven to be 94% to 95% effective in preventing virus symptoms in patients who receive the shots, researchers are still trying to figure out what risk vaccine recipients might pose to others. A  — one that had not been peer reviewed — suggested it is possible that those who have a degree of immunity against the virus may still be able to carry it in their nose or throat and therefore transmit it.Complicating the situation is that some of the newer strains of Covid-19 have been found to be more transmissible than the original, which could pose additional health risks.What's more, case counts are still high, which increases everyone's chances of encountering the virus.The ramifications of these data points are clear: Just because you get the vaccine  or practicing social distancing. It also means that vaccine recipients probably should think twice before they start being intimate with people who have yet to get the shots.Gandhi, the dating coach, said that as people get vaccinated and dive back into the dating pool, communicating mindfulness about these issues can go a long way.\"Awareness of the big picture shows you take it seriously,\" she said. \"It's signaling, in the best way.\"As for Jablow, the winemaker, vaccination status has changed nothing — especially when it comes to the way she prepares for potentially exposing others.She still wears face coverings. She still keeps her distance. She still avoids going inside the grocery store at all costs. Jablow went so far as to say that she's even more cautious about her health after receiving the vaccine — out of necessity.\"If I were to go on a date with someone who was unvaccinated, pick up Covid, and then give it to someone else, I don't know if I could sleep at night or live with myself,\" she said. \"It felt like I won the lottery when I learned I was going to get the vaccine. It's a responsibility. It's an honor. I can't screw it up. I won't.\"", "summary": "Safe dating takes on new meaning with the Covid-19 vaccine rollout.

{"text": "It's another home run for coffee consumption -- as long as it's black and caffeinated, that is.Drinking one or more cups of plain, leaded coffee a day was associated with a long-term reduced risk of heart failure, according to a review of diet data from three major studies using analytic tools from the American Heart Association.The benefit did not extend to decaffeinated coffee. Instead, the analysis found an association between decaf coffee and an increased risk for heart failure. occurs when a weakened heart fails to supply the body's cells with enough blood to get the oxygen needed to keep the body functioning properly. People with heart failure suffer fatigue and shortness of breath and have trouble walking, climbing stairs or other daily activities.\"While unable to prove causality, it is intriguing that these three studies suggest that drinking coffee is associated with a decreased risk of heart failure and that coffee can be part of a healthy dietary pattern if consumed plain, without added sugar and high fat dairy products such as cream,\" said registered dietitian Penny Kris-Etherton, immediate past chairperson of the American Heart Association's Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health Council Leadership Committee, in a statement. She was not involved with the research.The study, , analyzed self-reported dietary information from the original . That study, which began in 1948, enrolled over 5,000 people with no diagnosed heart disease who lived in Framingham, Massachusetts. The study has followed those people and their offspring for 72 years over three generations.The new study used state-of-the-art analytic tools from the AHA's  to compare the Framingham data to the , a longitudinal, multisite, biracial study, and the , a 10-year-long study of cardiovascular risk in adults over 65.Altogether, the studies provided dietary information on more than 21,000 adult Americans.Compared with people who didn't drink coffee, the analysis found the risk of heart failure over time decreased between 5% and 12% for each cup of coffee consumed each day in the Framingham Heart and the Cardiovascular Health studies. The risk of heart failure remained the same for drinking no coffee or one cup per day in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. But when people drank two or more cups of black coffee a day the risk decreased by about 30%, the analysis found.\"The association between caffeine and heart failure risk reduction was surprising,\" said senior author Dr. David Kao, medical director of the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora.\"Coffee and caffeine are often considered by the general population to be 'bad' for the heart because people associate them with palpitations, high blood pressure, etc. The consistent relationship between increasing caffeine consumption and decreasing heart failure risk turns that assumption on its head,\" Kao said in a statement.All of these studies were done with drinking black coffee. However, many people add dairy,  sugars, flavors or nondairy creamers that are high in calories, added sugar and fat. That likely negates any heart-healthy benefits, warns the AHA.Also be aware that in most studies a cup of coffee is only 8 ounces; the standard \"grande\" cup at the coffee shop is double that at 16 ounces.How you brew your coffee also has health consequences. Unlike filter coffee makers, a French press, Turkish coffee or the boiled coffee popular in Scandinavian countries fails to catch a compound called cafestol in the oily part of coffee. Cafestol can increase your bad cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoproteins).Caffeine can be dangerous if consumed in excess by certain populations, research has shown. High levels of coffee consumption (more than 4 cups) during pregnancy was associated with low birth weight, preterm birth and stillbirths in a . For women with a higher likelihood of bone fractures, coffee raised that risk; the same was not true for men.Past studies also suggested people with  or  should check with a doctor before adding caffeine to their diets.And, of course, these benefits do not apply to kids -- children and adolescents should not drink colas, coffees, energy drinks or other beverages with any amount of caffeine, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\"The bottom line: enjoy coffee in moderation as part of an overall heart-healthy dietary pattern that meets recommendations for fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat/non-fat dairy products, and that also is low in sodium, saturated fat and added sugars,\" Kris-Etherton said. \"Also, it is important to be mindful that caffeine is a stimulant and consuming too much may be problematic - causing jitteriness and sleep problems,\" she said.", "summary": "One or more cups of black coffee a day may reduce your risk for heart failure over time, according to a new analysis of research by the American Heart Association."},
{"text": "A roller coaster of research has stoked concerns that a coronavirus variant first linked to South Africa could be resistant to vaccines and raise the bar for herd immunity.But scientists and vaccine makers say the data have not yet had the final word, and there's still reason to be hopeful.On Sunday, health officials in South Africa announced a  on the rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine after a study suggested it offered \"minimal protection\" against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the variant, the  said.But that yet-unpublished study included a relatively small number of people who were young and healthy on the whole. Crucially, it was not able to measure how effective the vaccine was against severe disease, hospitalization or death.Dr. Anthony Fauci previously said that keeping people out of the hospital was \"the most important thing\" from a public health perspective.\"If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress and human suffering and death,\" Fauci said during a call with reporters last month.While researchers in South Africa continue to study the vaccine's impact on hospitalization there, AstraZeneca believes it will prove to be effective against the variant when it comes to severe disease, a spokesperson told CNN in a statement Sunday.Until more data becomes available, scientists are piecing together the puzzle with findings from clinical trials and the lab -- each offering a different but incomplete view of how the variant might impact Covid-19 vaccines.Before the AstraZeneca announcement, both Johnson & Johnson and Novavax had seen lower vaccine efficacy in South Africa.Novavax  its vaccine was 89% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 in a Phase 3 UK trial, but it only appeared 49% effective in a separate Phase 2b study conducted in South Africa. The latter rose to 60% when looking only at HIV-negative individuals.Similarly, in Johnson & Johnson's Phase 3 trial, efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease : 72% in the US versus 57% in South Africa.In both trials, 90 to 95% of cases in South Africa were linked to the variant, also known as B.1.351.The silver lining: Johnson & Johnson's trial showed that its single-shot vaccine was indeed effective against severe disease across the board.\"Across all geographies, across all variants, we see 85% protection\" against severe disease, Dr. Mathai Mammen, the company's global head of research and development, previously told CNN. Plus, from one month after the shot, all hospitalizations and deaths occurred in the placebo group.These results from Johnson & Jonhson have buoyed hope for AstraZeneca, as well.\"These two vaccines use a similar sort of technology,\" Dr. Shabir Madhi, professor of vaccinology at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, told the BBC Monday. Both vaccines use another type of virus -- an adenovirus -- as a shell that carries genetic instructions into the human body, leading to an immune response. Johnson & Johnson uses a weakened common cold adenovirus, while AstraZeneca has modified one from chimpanzees.\"So I think extrapolating from that, there's still some hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine might well perform as well as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a different age group demographic that are at risk of severe disease,\" Madhi said.While clinical trials have given a bird's eye view of vaccine efficacy, lab research has focused on the variant's mischief at a level that's invisible to the naked eye.Coronaviruses are known to mutate, generally in ways that are harmless to humans. But every now and then a mutation pops up that makes scientists look twice. These mutations can cause changes in the spike protein -- the protein the coronavirus uses to attach to human cells and infect them. The spike protein is also a key target of the antibodies we create in response to vaccines.A number of  have suggested that antibodies from vaccinated people are less effective at \"neutralizing\" the variant from infecting cells in the lab. But that doesn't mean the virus has completely escaped.Oxford's announcement this week said that neutralization activity against B.1.351 was \"substantially reduced when compared with the original strain of the coronavirus.\"Similar results have been seen, albeit to varying degrees, across \"almost every one of the vaccines that have been studied against this variant in different ways, either in the laboratory or in clinical studies,\" Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, the chair of the South African government's coronavirus advisory panel, previously told CNN.Many lab studies have looked at  engineered to carry key mutations in B.1.351, while some research has tested the full . Experts say the latter offers a more complete picture of how the variant's mutations might interact with each other and have combined effects. Scientists have often focused on a mutation , which appears to help the variant escape some of the protection offered by antibodies. This mutation is also part of the genetic signature of the P.1 variant first linked to Brazil, and it has cropped up in a handful of cases of .The issue with lab studies, however, is that it's hard to know whether less neutralization in the lab means less protection in real life.\"When you look at the studies done in labs, there was less neutralizing activity against the South Africa strain,\" vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit told CNN after Novavax and Johnson & Johnson shared their results. Those trials appeared to confirm earlier lab findings, he said.Offit, who advises the US Food and Drug Administration on vaccines, said the two vaccines currently authorized in the US -- Moderna and Pfizer -- could also be somewhat less effective against the variant. Last year, these two vaccines showed upward of 94% efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19, with perhaps even higher efficacy against severe cases. But those results largely came before variants like B.1.351 were known to be widely circulating. For now, much of what we know about about Moderna and Pfizer's effectiveness against the variant comes from lab research. Both companies have signaled they believe their vaccines will still protect against the variant.\"It's really hard to compare numbers head-to-head right now without running a study with two vaccines,\" said Johnson & Johnson's Mammen. The spotlight on antibodies, however, may leave out much of the complexity of our immune systems -- which can adapt to threats like coronavirus and recruit other cells to the fight, including T cells.\"You can't see all of that breadth just by looking at antibodies,\" said Marion Pepper, associate professor at the University of Washington's department of immunology.Still, many of the key players are developing tools to combat variants like B.1.351, which has been found in more than 40 countries and territories around the world, including a handful of cases in the US.Moderna has announced it will test  to its current two-shot regimen: an additional shot of its currently authorized vaccine, and one that's modified specifically for B.1.351. Pfizer has also said it's \"laying the groundwork\" to create a vaccine booster.Last month, Novavax started developing the next iterations of its vaccine, which may take the form of a booster or a combined \"bivalent\" vaccine. Johnson & Johnson, whose Phase 3 data came from its one-shot vaccine, is also testing a two-shot regimen.Similarly, Oxford and AstraZeneca are thinking ahead.\"Efforts are underway to develop a new generation of vaccines that will allow protection to be redirected to emerging variants as booster jabs, if it turns out that it is necessary to do so,\" Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said in a statement Sunday. \"We are working with AstraZeneca to optimise the pipeline required for a strain change should one become necessary. \"This is the same issue that is faced by all of the vaccine developers, and we will continue to monitor the emergence of new variants that arise in readiness for a future strain change.\"But there's no reason to wait for a new generation of vaccines to get one. On the contrary, experts say the emergence of variants makes the vaccine rollout all the more timely: The more people get vaccinated, the more hospitalizations may be prevented, and the less chance the virus has to mutate.\"You need to get vaccinated when it becomes available as quickly and as expeditiously as possible throughout the country,\" Fauci said in a virtual news briefing Monday. \"Viruses cannot mutate if they don't replicate. And if you stop their replication by vaccinating widely ... you will not get mutations.\"CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Jamie Gumbrecht, Jacqueline Howard, Maggie Fox and Naomi Thomas contributed to this report.

{"text": "At just 9 years old, Ally Tumblin has inspired legislation in Congress that could help thousands of Americans pay for hearing aid devices by mandating insurance companies to cover them. It all started in 2019 with a simple letter to her elected official after the then third-grader was assigned to do something to better her community for class. She decided to write to her congressman, Rep. Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat, about her struggle to hear and how important her BAHA was, a bone-anchored hearing aid that's used to treat hearing loss. It's an implantable device that most insurance companies do not cover and can cost up to $10,000.Tumblin's life relies heavily on her BAHA as she suffers from , a rare birth defect where the external ear is small and not properly formed. Many times, as in Tumblin's case, having microtia also means having aural atresia, a missing ear canal. When the Tumblin family realized Ally's diagnosis after she was born, they were shocked to find that no insurance company would cover her BAHA, despite her doctors confirming the device as medically necessary. \"From birth to age three ... that's the critical years of development. Every medical professional knows that is the time the child's speech and language and vocabulary skills are coming in,\" said Melissa Tumblin, Ally's mother. \"And it's critical to help them hear their best and for insurance providers to deny these hearing devices is ridiculous.\" The Tumblin family ended up paying for Ally's BAHA out of pocket. Insurance coverage for hearing devices vary by state and most typically only pay for traditional air conduction hearing aids. More sophisticated devices, like BAHAs and cochlear implants, are not covered and cost more than traditional hearing aids.After receiving Tumblin's letter, Rep. Neguse established. The bill would require insurance providers to cover osseointegrated devices, including BAHAs and cochlear implants for children and adults from birth to age 64. Coverage would extend to services to the hearing devices, upgrades, surgery and associated costs. Ally's Act is a bipartisan effort, co-sponsored by West Virginia Republican Rep. David McKinley, who himself uses a cochlear hearing device, and Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson of California. It also earned the support of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. In an emailed statement to CNN, Neguse expressed his enthusiasm for the Tumblin family's work around hearing loss and for bringing the issue to his attention. \"For Ally and so many others, specialized hearing devices are critical for communicating. For insurance companies to deny coverage for these essential devices goes against common sense,\" Neguse said.Since her daughter's diagnosis, Melissa Tumblin struggled to find answers and support around microtia and hearing loss. So she created , a non-profit focused on creating awareness of microtia and aural atresia, funding for those who struggled to pay for hearing devices and even established November 9 as National Microtia Awareness Day. Since its inception in 2012, Ear Community has helped thousands of families across the US and globally. From newborns to firemen, veterinarians and congressman, Tumblin has seen firsthand how people are impacted by hearing loss. \"There's nothing wrong with these people. They're perfectly normal, healthy people who want the best life they can provide like everyone else. So, to just be denied the chance to be able to hear, it's terrible,\" said Tumblin.Ally's Act was the first bill reintroduced to the new 117th Congress on January 27. It will need 290 co-sponsors to help become law and has been endorsed by dozens of medical associations, including the American Academy of Audiology and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.", "summary": "At just 9-years-old Ally Tumblin inspired legislation in Congress that could help thousands of Americans pay for hearing aid devices by mandating insurance companies cover them.

{"text": "Shipments of  vaccines will be headed to pharmacies this week under a federal program that aims to get more people vaccinated quickly.Twenty-one \"national pharmacy partners and networks of independent pharmacies representing over 40,000 pharmacy locations nationwide\" are taking part in the program, according to a government , which includes a list of all participating pharmacies or networks.In phase one of the distribution plan, 1 million doses will be sent out to about 6,500 stores including Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Publix pharmacies, and others, starting on February 11.Many pharmacies already vaccinate people against a number of illnesses, including the flu and shingles. Some experts have suggested that pharmacies nationwide will have the capacity to administer 100 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine once supply is available.\"Based on conservative assumptions, pharmacies have the capacity to meet the demand for 100 million vaccine doses in one month when that level of the vaccine supply is available,\" Steven Anderson, president and CEO of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, .Pharmacies are also \"readily accessible in most communities, with most Americans living within five miles of a pharmacy,\" White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said earlier this week.Here's a look at how the plan will work.The pharmacies that will have the vaccine are selected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and states, taking into account \"their ability to reach some of the populations most at risk for severe illness from Covid-19, including socially vulnerable communities,\" according to Zients.\"In the early phase, many pharmacies across the country will not have vaccine, or may have very limited supply,\" Zients  Tuesday.CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid will be offering vaccines at some stores starting Friday to those eligible for it who have an appointment.CVS and Walgreens have said they will get around 420,000 doses of the 1 million doses available. Rite Aid will be getting 116,300 doses for  about 1,200 of its pharmacies, the company said in a release on Thursday.CVS said it will be offering doses to people eligible in some of its stores in , including California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.CVS will have about a quarter of the total initial million doses. The chain had said last week it would be offering those as of Thursday, but pushed it back a day \"to ensure in-store availability,\" the company said Tuesday. Walgreens said it will begin offering vaccines on February 12 , including Chicago and other places in Illinois, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, including New York City, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, Vermont, Wisconsin and West Virginia.Rite Aid will be offering the vaccine in some of its stores in California, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The cities of Philadelphia and New York City are also included.\"Initially, vaccine appointments will still be difficult to schedule at any provider,\" Heyward Donigan, Rite Aid president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. \"However, we expect to see availability of the vaccine improve over time.\"Not every pharmacy in these states will have the vaccine in this initial phase. However, \"as more supply becomes available the company will expand to additional states while increasing the number of stores offering vaccinations,\" CVS said in a news release. More than 1,000 Walmart and Sam's Clubswill be offering the vaccine in some of its stores in Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Louisiana and Wyoming. \"Once a store or club receives allocation, our online scheduler will be available to make appointments,\" Walmart said in a statement.Walmart worked with states and the CDC in choosing the locations in the initial phase, looking at population density, customer demographics, infection rates and the availability of local health care resources, among other factors.\"For example, the Walmart store in Brewton, Alabama, was chosen because it is in a designated medically underserved area and is the only location to administer the vaccine for 102 miles,\" the company said in a  Wednesday.Walmart said  that it expects it will be able to administer 10 million to 13 million doses per month \"when supply and allocations allow\" across its more than 5,000 pharmacies in the United States and Puerto Rico.CVS has said it eventually expects to be able to administer as many as 20 million to 25 million shots per month across its nearly 10,000 stores.The pharmacies in the program will follow the state's guidelines and only vaccinate people who are eligible in that state. Most states have followed the CDC's recommendation and are offering vaccines to frontline workers and the elderly in long-term care facilities right now. States like Florida and Georgia are also offering vaccines to people 65 and older.Those who are eligible will be able to sign up for an appointment. Experts are hopeful that vaccination appointments will eliminate wait times for clients, and make the process similar to getting a flu vaccination at your local drug store. There is normally a 15-minute wait time  getting the Covid-19 shot, which is in place to make sure people don't have an allergic reaction.Appointments can be made online or by phone. At Walgreens, appointments can be booked through a . The CVS website lets you .Requiring everyone to have an appointment will also help stores make sure people are socially distanced and that there's no crowding.\"Vaccines are by appointment, so we know how many people will need to be observed,\" a Walmart spokesperson told CNN in an email. In locations where Walmart will host vaccination clinics, it will have floor decals to mark social distancing. Stores will also space out chairs so people are socially distant. Everyone will be able to get the vaccine at no cost, even people who have no health insurance or are under-insured. Vaccine supply at this stage is the main challenge. There will only be 1 million doses sent to drug stores at first, and it's not clear if or when the allocation to drug stores will be increased. That will ramp up over time, as more supply becomes available.CVS has hired around 10,000 pharmacy technicians to administer vaccines and coronavirus testing, Michael DeAngelis, a CVS spokesman, said. It plans to have around 90,000 employees, including pharmacists, licensed pharmacy technicians and nurses, administering vaccines.Walmart has not put a number on how many pharmacy staff members it will need to add for vaccine administering. But it is offering current staff a bonus for referring qualified candidates, a Walmart spokesperson told CNN in an email.Supply constraints and a patchwork system of vaccine eligibility by states are not the only challenges facing these chains and their staff. The pharmacy chains are also preparing for  misinformation online about the vaccine as well.Giant Eagle, which has more than 400 stores in five states, has prepared talking points for its more than 600 pharmacists who will administer the vaccine. The goal is to help combat false information about the virus, Victor Vercammen, chief pandemic officer at the chain, said in an interview last month.\"We are also doing our best to educate the public ... to help them sift through what might be on social media, what might be factual, what might be opinion, around topics like Covid vaccine safety,\" he said.Once the supply of vaccine is available, pharmacies around the country could be vaccinating seven people an hour and 100 million a month, even with current staffing, according to the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.The group's model assumes that 40,000 chain pharmacies, including traditional drug stores like CVS and Walgreens, grocery stores like Kroger and large retailers such as Walmart and Costco, can administer 3.3 million vaccinations per day. The model does not include independent pharmacies in the United States that will also administer the vaccine and are part of the federal partnership.If all of the nearly 17,000 independent pharmacies that give immunizations had the vaccine, they could administer approximately 1.28 million per day, according to the National Community Pharmacists Association.", "summary": "Shipments of Covid-19 vaccines will be headed to pharmacies this week under a federal program that aims to get more people vaccinated quickly."},

Starting Monday in the UK, passengers must have a negative Covid-19 test within three days of boarding a flight to the United States.   A CDC  Thursday hailed the new changes.  \"Today, President Trump is taking another step to protect the health of the American people,\" according to the statement.   But according to researchers on the CDC's Covid-19 response team, testing three days before a flight might not accomplish very much -- reducing the risk of spreading the virus by just 5 to 9%. Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, said the  \"is like putting up a chain link fence to keep out a mosquito.\"  The  that \"testing does not eliminate all risk,\" but when combined with other measures like self-monitoring for symptoms, masks and distancing, \"it can make travel safer.\" A federal official told CNN that the new order is just one layer in a multi-layered approach to curtail the spread of the new variant, which appears to transmit more easily than other coronavirus strains. In March, the CDC cut off travel from the UK for foreign nationals, which brought travel from the UK to the US down 90%, from about 30,000 to 3,000 passengers a day, the official said.In addition, the CDC has recommendations for international travelers, including getting tested one to three days before a flight and three to five days after travel, combined with staying home for seven days after travel, even if they test negative. Covid-19 tests often miss recent infections, so someone can test negative and actually be infected because they're not shedding enough virus to be detected.   \"Testing 72 hours before a flight is going to miss a lot of people,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease specialist at the Baylor College of Medicine, who pointed out that the new variant appeared in the UK three months ago and is likely already in the United States.

This is the first known case of allergic reaction from a Moderna coronavirus vaccine, although there have been at least six similar reported cases in the United States associated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.\"After I got the vaccine, I felt tachycardic, but I felt like it was probably anxiety because I was scared after learning about Pfizer's reactions in the US, especially with those people who have shellfish allergies, like me,\" Dr. Hossein Sadrzadeh explained to CNN.  is a medical term for a heart rate over 100 beats per minute.  After having his vitals checked, Sadrzadeh realized his heart rate had spiked.\"My heart rate was 150, my normal heart rate is 75 but ... six, seven minutes after the injection of the vaccine, I felt in my tongue and also my throat having, like, some weird sensation of tingling and numbness, the same reaction that I had before to my shellfish allergy,\" Sadrzadeh said.Sadrzadeh said his blood pressure dipped so low it wasn't even detectable with a monitor. That's when he decided to use his EpiPen, and then the staff rushed him to the emergency room, which was only a couple of minutes from the room he was in after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. Sadrzadeh was monitored for four more hours after his allergic reaction and was able to drive home after that. He says the medical center staff \"responded exceptionally well.\" Boston Medical Center emailed a statement about Sadrzadeh's reaction to CNN on Friday.\"The employee received the Moderna vaccine Thursday and as is our standard practice was being observed post vaccination by trained nurses. He felt he was developing an allergic reaction and was allowed to self-administer his personal epi-pen. He was taken to the Emergency Department, evaluated, treated, observed and discharged. He is doing well today,\" the statement said.\"The main concern for me as a human being and as a physician ... I have to get the word out to people ... People should have the EpiPen with them if they have allergy reactions,\" said Sadrzadeh, urging Moderna to investigate further.Ray Jordan, a spokesperson from the biotechnology company, told CNN: \"Moderna can't confirm the incident but reported the potential adverse event through its internal safety reporting system and Moderna is further investigating the incident.\"It's still unknown what ingredient in the coronavirus vaccines may be causing severe allergic reaction in some people. Dr. Peter Marks, who heads the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a briefing last week that the agency is investigating a compound known as polyethylene glycol (PEG), as well as four other possible ingredients in the formulation.  \"It is known that one of the components that is present in both of the vaccines, polyethylene glycol, can be associated uncommonly with allergic reactions,\" Marks said. Polyethylene glycol is a compound that appears in a number of pharmaceuticals including some bowel preparations and laxatives. \"That could be a culprit here. And that's why we'll be watching very closely as we see the Moderna vaccine rolled out,\" he said.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla explained in a town hall on Thursday that adverse reactions to the vaccine were \"very rare\" in clinical trials. He pointed out that now that the vaccine is being distributed to millions of people, adverse events are inevitable. He added that these incidents should not keep people from taking the vaccine, especially those with preexisting conditions that put them at risk for severe Covid-19. On Wednesday, Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, said there are discussions between the vaccine makers and the National Institutes of Health to consider conducting clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccines in very allergic populations, such as those who have to carry an EpiPen with them at all times. He said a trial could help understand the rate of allergic reactions and what is provoking them. He had previously told CNN's Jake Tapper that the key is to be aware that allergic reactions can happen. \"If you prepare, these are the kinds of events that can be dealt with,\" Slaoui said. \"And we'll continue to try and understand what is it in the vaccine that induces this, if there is something that induces this that's specific.\"Elizabeth Cohen, Maggie Fox, Naomi Thomas and Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report", "summary": "A health care worker who experienced an allergic reaction after receiving a Moderna Covid-19 vaccine at Boston Medical Center on Christmas Eve tells CNN he has a history of allergies.

{"text": "Researchers studying the new UK strain of the coronavirus think it likely arrived in the US in mid-November, and that many people in the United States could already be infected.   \"If I had to guess, I would say it's probably in hundreds of people by now,\" said Michael Worobey, head of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona. \"It's very possible it's arrived multiple times in multiple places.\"  \"Imagine the amount of infected travelers leaving London -- that's been increasing exponentially,\" said Trevor Bedford, associate professor in the vaccine and infectious disease division of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.   British scientists have traced the new strain's earliest known appearance back to September 20 in Kent, a county southeast of London.   Worobey and Bedford say they estimate the virus would have arrived in the US in mid-November.   Both scientists, as well as others around the world, have scoured genetic sequences of coronavirus in the United States to see if any match up with the UK variant. So far, they haven't found any, but they say that's likely because the US surveillance system isn't catching them.   Health officials agree.   \"You really need to assume that it's here already, and certainly is not the dominant strain, but I would not be surprised at all if it is already here,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday.   \"It could be in the United States, and we might not have yet detected it,\" Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir said Monday.   The UK coronavirus variant has not been identified through sequencing efforts in the United States, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a scientific brief posted on its website Tuesday.   However, it says, only about 51,000 of 17 million US cases it has tallied have been sequenced — less than half a percent.   \"Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected,\" the CDC said.  To detect new mutations of a virus, samples are gathered from infected patients and then undergo genetic sequencing, looking at the order of the letters in its genetic code for anything new.  In the US, only a relatively small number of samples go through this process.   Since November 15 -- about the time the UK variant might have arrived in the US -- genetic sequencing has been done on viruses found in about 300 people in the United States and in about 9,000 in the UK, Worobey said.   \"We're flying blind,\" Worobey said. \"Maybe some other similarly interesting variant is sweeping up with high frequency, but we're just not seeing it.\"   On its website,  notes that of about 275,000 full-genome sequences in public databases, 51,000 are from the United States, and 125,000 are from the UK.  This difference is especially striking considering how many more infections have been confirmed in the US -- over 18 million - compared with over 2.1 million in the UK.  Health officials say research so far shows the changes do appear to make the virus more transmissible, but it doesn't appear that the variant causes more severe disease. They also say that at this point, it looks like the vaccine will still work against the UK variant.  Last month, the CDC launched a strain surveillance program where states will send in at least 10 samples biweekly for analysis. The agency expects to have the program fully implemented in January.

{"text": "While the coronavirus pandemic continued to surge throughout the summer and fall, federal government officials repeatedly offered a ray of hope: enough vaccine doses to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of December. But after the first week of vaccine distribution and with only nine days left to meet their self-imposed deadline, Operation Warp Speed is on track to fall well short of 20 million shots in arms.One count, from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shows about 11.4 million doses have been distributed as of Monday morning and about 2.1 million have been administered -- not even close to the goal Warp Speed originally set.  Officials at US Health and Human Services and the CDC say the agency's tallies are undercounting many vaccinations due to data lags, but even accounting for reporting delays, the US vaccination program appears to be taking longer than Warp Speed officials projected.One early hurdle: A two-day US Food and Drug Administration requirement to assess each shipment of vaccine for quality control slowed down distribution. States were told by OWS to expect fewer doses for week two than originally planned. With the 20 million number seeming further from reach, OWS officials acknowledged last Monday they may not get there until January.\"We do still feel strongly that we will have allocated to the states by the end of the year 20 million doses of vaccine that'll be available,\" Gen. Gustave Perna, Operation Warp Speed's chief operating officer said during the call December 21. \"We feel confident that we will be distributing the end part of that vaccine no later than the first week in January for everybody to have access to.\" An HHS official said that nearly 16 million doses have already been allocated for states and jurisdictions to order. But, as more vaccine doses are available, both Operation Warp Speed and the state and health care partners receiving the vaccine will also need to be able to scale up the complicated distribution and logistics needed to get vaccines from point A to point B.\"It does seem like getting to 20 million by the beginning of the year is ambitious,\" Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said. Still, \"people seem to be really very encouraged about how the vaccinations are going,\" Plescia added. \"Everybody seems to feel like they are using the supply that they have.\"The vaccination effort is almost certainly moving faster than the low numbers the CDC data reveal. In addition to launching new vaccination programs, states are also grappling with new vaccination reporting tools, causing delays in the data. The latest numbers also do not include most of the larger vaccination efforts that are just getting underway this week in long-term care facilities. CDC distribution data has just started to include the Moderna vaccine, which was rolling out to more than 3,500 locations. While the CDC plans to update the data regularly, daily updates are not slated to begin until 2021.Some states, like Michigan, are reporting their own data, but that state-level reporting lags, too.Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Public Information Officer Lynn Sutfin pointed out that the state's dashboard is not updated in real time and providers have up to 24 hours to upload their administered doses into the vaccine registry.Michael Pratt, chief communications officer for Operation Warp Speed, lauded the federal government's progress so far.\"These doses are being distributed at states' direction to the American people as quickly as they are available and releasable, and the rapid availability and distribution of so many doses -- with 20 million doses expected to be allocated for distribution just 18 days after the first vaccine was granted emergency use authorization -- is a testament to the success of Operation Warp Speed,\" Pratt said in a statement to CNN.On top of states  that they will receive fewer doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine than initially promised in the next few weeks, they're juggling how to ensure that every dose they receive gets administered in a timely manner.While vaccines have been sent to every state, vaccinations are only just beginning in some areas. Dayton, Ohio, Mayor Nan Whaley said on CNN last Tuesday that her city had not yet started administering vaccines, although vaccinations began in Ohio on December 14.\"To date, we still have not started vaccine distribution in Dayton,\" Whaley said Tuesday, adding that Christmas Eve will be the first day someone from Dayton receives the vaccine.\"We aren't a big city that gets these assets quickly. We have talked about this, how testing was very slow in communities like Dayton and across the country, and I'm concerned that vaccine distribution will be slow as well,\" she added. Even though all states have data on the number of people being vaccinated, only 23 states have publicly released that information, a survey from Johns Hopkins University . CDC and state numbers are not a real-time reflection of the vaccinations happening on the ground, but they raise questions about how states are ensuring their full supply is being efficiently used. The lag between doses received and doses administered starts to become even more daunting when considering each state is slated to receive more doses from Pfizer and first round doses from Moderna last week; in many cases, the first week's shipment of doses haven't been fully administered yet. In Michigan, the state's Covid-19 vaccine dashboard December 28 shows only 37,660 doses of the vaccine have been administered out of the 231,075 doses sent to the state. Sutfin said the delay in shipments and lag in data updates explains the discrepancy.\"While Michigan received over 84,000 doses last week, they were not all received the same day. Vaccine is being delivered daily to hospitals and local health departments across the state. As they understand more about operations and clinic flow, we expect the time from receipt to administration to decrease\" Sutfin told CNN. Sutfin also outlined that the process for unpacking, inventorying, thawing, and coordinating each dose of vaccine \"takes some time, so it is expected that at any point in time there will be a difference between vaccine received and doses administered.\"In Florida as of Monday morning,  have received the Covid-19 vaccine. The state initially received 179,400 doses from Pfizer. Florida Hospital Association President and CEO Mary Mayhew told CNN that reconfiguring clinical space in a socially distanced way and allocating staff for vaccine administration explain why the initial number of people vaccinated does not match the supply of vaccine available.   \"I am confident that hospitals are efficiently and effectively deploying critical resources to support the urgent administration of vaccines to front line healthcare staff,\" Mayhew said when asked if she was worried about the discrepancy. \"Hospitals are working collaboratively with other community healthcare partners to support timely distribution of the vaccines.\"Even though states are overseeing the vaccine distribution process, many state health departments or governor offices have left the actual administration of the vaccine to the specific hospital, long-term care facility or pharmacy slated to receive the shipment. This decentralized structure could cause some delays in learning where weaknesses are in the process. Mississippi Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs explained during a Tuesday press conference that it was not the state's job to make sure vaccines actually went into people's arms once it was allocated to long-term care facilities.\"They haven't started vaccinating,\" Dobbs said referring to long term care facilities, \"but we have released the allocation sufficient for them to get started so they're in the process of getting that set up. And you know, that's something that's out of our control. But you know, within the next couple of weeks they'll get that rolling.\"Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said he's not surprised at some of the initial issues with the vaccine rollout.\"It's a little frustrating because it's not like we didn't know that vaccines were coming,\" he told CNN's Kate Bolduan Monday.  \"It's going to go a little bit more slowly -- again, better planning would have moved us faster, but here we are and let's just get these vaccines out as quickly as we can, to the right people,\" he said.Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, is more optimistic with the rollout, saying so far, it has gone \"reasonably well.\" He does hope the incoming Biden administration is thinking about how to get accurate numbers to states to set expectations for Americans about when life can return to normal.\"It is not in our interest to have these multiple estimates as to when it gets to the rest of the population because I don't think you can do good planning that way,\" Benjamin told CNN. \"I hope the new administration is sitting down and thinking about the messaging, so people don't get their hopes up to get vaccinated.\" That being said, the vaccines were developed in record time without the normal \"bureaucratic pace,\" Benjamin said. He believes this process has given Americans new exposure to what the vaccine development process is like.\"The American public is getting a good sense of the vaccination process that they've never had before, and I think that people should pay a lot of attention to this, when people talk about what public health does, this is an example of what we do,\" Benjamin said.CNN's John Bonifield and Ronnie Glassberg contributed to this report.", "summary": "While the coronavirus pandemic continued to surge throughout the summer and fall, federal government officials repeatedly offered a ray of hope: enough vaccine doses to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of December.

{"text": "Dr. Anthony Fauci turns 80 on Thursday, but don't expect him to get philosophical on his big birthday.   \"I'm afraid if you sort of start dropping back and philosophizing about things, you could take your attention away from the job that we have,\" he told CNN. \"So, I will leave the philosophizing to another day.\"   Fauci's job right now is formidable. Nearly 120,000 Americans woke up Thursday in the hospital with Covid-19, a record for the pandemic. On Wednesday, more than 3,000 people died from the virus.   Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has a very clear message to the country: \"Curtail travel to the extent possible [and] don't congregate in large dinners and celebrations.\"   He'll be heeding his own advice on his birthday and Christmas.   \"I really feel strongly that I need to practice what I preach to the country,\" he said. \"Although I would love very much to have my children, who live in different parts of the country, [to] come in together and have a celebration for my birthday and Christmas, I don't think that's the prudent thing to do, so I'll be having a quiet dinner with my wife, and we'll Zoom in the children.\"   He knows that what he's asking people to do isn't easy. He knows it's hard to stay away from the people you love, especially during the holidays, or milestone events like big birthdays.   \"I definitely feel sad,\" he said. \"I have three daughters, ranging in age from late 20s to early 30s, [and] this is the first holiday season of Christmas and my birthday that I have not spent with my daughters since they were born. So, [it] is sad, but we all have tried to take an upbeat attitude.\"   He and his family hold tight to the idea that there will be a big reunion -- just not now.   \"Next year hopefully at this time, we'll have a real in-person celebration with a lot of hugs that we can't do right now,\" he said. \"We'll look forward to better times.\"   And when those better times arrive, he said, \"we'll make the most out of it.\"     was born December 24, 1940, in Brooklyn. In 1966, he received his medical degree from Cornell University Medical College, and then went on to do his internship and residency at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.   Fauci calls this early training \"really extremely exciting and gratifying.\"   In 1968, he started at the National Institutes of Health, where he learned \"the ins and outs\" of infectious diseases and immunology.   He says his work there on the HIV epidemic \"both transformed my professional career and my life and defines me as a physician, a scientist and a public health person.\"   Of the six -- soon to be seven -- presidents he has served, Fauci says the one that stands out for him is George W. Bush, who established the  that has supported antiretroviral treatment for nearly 17.2 million people worldwide with HIV.    For decades before Covid-19, Fauci said his worst nightmare was what has unfolded this year.   \"A brand new virus that emerges, likely out of an animal reservoir, that's respiratory born, that has the capability of spreading very, very, very efficiently among humans, and that has a high degree of morbidity and mortality,\" he said. \"That had been my worst nightmare, but you don't anticipate or expect your worst nightmare to come true.\"    Since that nightmare started to unfold in mid-January of 2020, Fauci said he hasn't taken a day off.  \"The days just melt into one another. You lose track of time. I think many people have experienced what I've experienced. It's like one big blur,\" he said. \"Sometimes you wake up in the morning and for a very brief moment you're wondering -- 'Is it July? Is it March? Or is it really December?' -- because you're so preoccupied with what you're doing.\"   When asked how he deals with this intensity at age 80, he says his energy levels haven't really changed since he was a young man.   \"I've always been a very energetic person,\" he said. \"When I was in my 20s and 30s and 40s, I had boundless energy. It just seems that has not diminished very much.\"   When asked if he works 24-7, Fauci laughs.   \"Well, not 24-7, but more like 18-7,\" he said.   Does the near constant work ever wear on him?   \"I would imagine it is - I don't pay attention to its wearing on me. I think sometimes I'm quite exhausted, but you just keep going,\" Fauci said. \"You just kind of have to dig deep and suck it up because the problem itself is of such enormity that it just requires that you have to put a full effort into it.\"   Fauci will keep going in the new year in the role of medical adviser to President-elect Joe Biden.   \"I think that sooner or later I'm going to have to [retire]. I don't see that right now clearly in my future,\" he said.   He says the only thing he sees in front of him is \"the challenge that we are currently facing\" to get \"out of this terrible pandemic that we're totally immersed in.\"  ", "summary": "Dr. Anthony Fauci turns 80 on Thursday, but don't expect him to get philosophical on his big birthday.  \"I'm afraid if you sort of start dropping back and philosophizing about things, you could take your attention away from the job that we have,\" he told CNN. \"So, I will leave the philosophizing to another day.\"  "},
{"text": "Next year will be a crucial year for Erika Kirgios as she works to complete her doctorate, publish academic papers and try to land a faculty job at a university.Not surprisingly, one of her New Year's resolutions is to focus on her career.In order to find some delight in what could be long nights working alone, she is applying her research in the science of behavior change to pair meticulous work -- writing research articles -- with a decadent temptation -- in her case, a particular candle and cup of tea.\"I'm really going to focus on writing,\" Kirgios said. \"I only light my favorite candle and drink my favorite tea when I'm writing because I need to make sure that I have the external motivations to get started.The doctoral student at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School has an advantage -- her research focuses on ways we can ensure successful behavioral change.The good news is that her lab has found a litany of ways science can make your resolution stick this year. Here's how to proceed.Kirgios' method for increasing her likelihood of a successful resolution is known as \"temptation bundling,\" according to Katy Milkman, professor of operations, information and decisions at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Milkman oversees Kirgios' research and co-directs Penn's Behavior Change for Good Initiative. She is also the author of the upcoming book \".\"Kirgios and Milkman tested temptation bundling in a study published this year of more than 6,000 members of 24 Hour Fitness gyms around the United States. One group was given a free audiobook and encouragement to listen to it while working out; a second group was given the free audiobook without the extra nudge; and a third group didn't receive the book. Those who consciously bundled the temptation of the free audiobook with exercising were 10% to 14% more likely to have a weekly workout than those who didn't have a book.That same concept can work in other situations. As the mother of a 4-year-old, Milkman, the Wharton professor, is thinking about setting a resolution to stay off her phone and be more present with her family during dinner.One way she could accomplish that is by having her husband make a donation to a charity she hates every time she slips up and responds to a buzz on her phone during dinner.One online tool, , enables you to put real money on the line to help you stick to your commitments.Milkman declined to name which loathed charity her husband might pick to send 10 bucks whenever she slips her phone out at the table. But use your imagination, and brainstorm how you can up the ante financially to encourage positive behavior in yourself or a friend.For goal setting, you can follow the , which stands for Wish, Outcome, Obstacles and Plan. That means beginning with a wish and imagining a positive outcome that could emerge from achieving that goal. Then you identify any obstacles hindering you, before devising a plan to navigate around them.It's similar to temptation bundling, and refers to stacking an activity you'd like to start after a routine habit. Many people brush their teeth every day, but fewer people floss. So British scientists designed  in which one group of people was told to floss before brushing, and another after brushing.Eight months later, those who trained to floss after brushing had a stronger habit than the other group. A  by scientists published in the open-access journal PLOS One showed that framing your resolution positively could be a way to increase your likelihood of success. Researchers from Stockholm University and Linköping University in Sweden noticed that resolvers with \"approach\" goals were 12% more likely to succeed than those with goals centered around avoiding something.So consider phrasing your resolution, \"I want to start cycling,\" rather than, for instance, \"I want to quit eating ice cream.\" Slipups happen. So factor them in. Rather than trying to meditate every day, your goal could be to meditate five out of seven days per week.That's one way to avoid what behavior change researchers call the Abstinence Violation Effect, in which you say \"screw it\" after missing a day of routine and let it slide even more. So use your slips as an opportunity to learn.\"Don't let a slip become a fall,\" said John Norcross, distinguished professor and chair of psychology at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania and author of the book \".\"Besides focusing on writing papers and job searching, Kirgios also has a resolution to do yoga for 15 minutes every evening with her mother.\"That way, we can be each other's commitment device,\" she said. \"I have the added benefit of helping my mom achieve her goals, too, and of sharing some daily quality time.\"Hang out too much on Twitter or Facebook? Announce your resolutions on social media, so your community can help hold you accountable, too.\"There's hundreds of studies in the health psychology literature suggesting in fact that social support does in fact make a difference,\" Norcross said. And people don't fail at resolutions as much as we think they do. About 40% to 44% of New Year's resolutions are successful, as measured six months later when researchers check back in with resolvers, according to a  published in the Journal of Substance Abuse.On the one hand, that feels like a pretty decent track record. On the other hand, it still means the majority of New Year's resolutions fail by the Fourth of July.It brings up a key question: Should we even set resolutions?\"I'm very much a fan of New Year's resolutions. I'm a fan of Monday resolutions, and beginning of the month resolutions, and after rejection resolutions and after-you-miss-your-noon-workout resolutions,\" Milkman said.That faith comes from studying what she calls the \"fresh start\" effect, which she observed in a . She and colleagues observed that gym visits, commitments to and Google searches for terms such as \"diet\" all increase around particular landmarks in time. These new \"mental accounting periods\" could be the start of a new semester, a birthday or a holiday.\"I love that there's moments throughout our lives when we sort of stand back and assess what we could do better and I think that's how we grow,\" she said.And if you worry about setting a resolution this year because it might not work, there's virtue in trying anyways, to find out what the exercise could teach you.\"One of the key things I feel like I've learned in the last decade of studying this is that goal failure is the norm,\" Milkman said. \"The whole ball game is figuring out how we recover from failure, keep trying and getting better.\"", "summary": "If you want your resolutions to stick this year, try bundling a new activity with a habit you already enjoy.

Vaccines will only make any meaningful impact once they're widely available to the public, possibly not until summertime, experts have said.And many states are reporting alarming trends.In Georgia, where the average number of new daily coronavirus cases is more than double what it was just six weeks ago, officials are Atlanta's large convention center as an overflow medical center.

New Orleans officials , with indoor facilities for bars, breweries, and live adult entertainment venues closed Thursday.In Nevada, a similar message: Gov. Steve Sisolak urged residents to avoid high-risk activities to slow the spread of the virus in the state. \"I know people want to celebrate the end of 2020, and I don't blame them. But if we don't start making smart choices at the start of 2021, we will look a lot and feel a lot more like 2020 than any of us want it to be,\" the governor said. Texas reported a record number of hospitalizations for the fourth day in a row on Thursday. California's Los Angeles County hit a grim milestone Wednesday, surpassing 10,000totalCovid-19 deaths.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told Jake Tapper: \"This is what we all feared.\"He urged people to make their New Year's resolutions to stay home to help stop the spread of the virus.\"We are still going to have our toughest and darkest days,\" Garcetti said.More than 2.7 million doses of the vaccine have been administered, according to the latest CDC numbers, and more than 12.4 million have been distributed in the US. The numbers are still a far cry from the 20 million vaccinations that . \"We have literally 10 million doses sitting on the shelf around the country, waiting to go into arms. We need mass events,\" CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, said Thursday. \"We need large events at football stadiums and racetracks. \"We need to go into mass vaccination mode, and we need to do it now.\"State and local leaders have also exp ressed concern about the slow pace.  In New York City, officials announced a plan to get vaccines into 1 million people there by the end of January, expanding on the 88,000 people who've received a dose currently.The first of several city-operated vaccine hubs -- in places such as school gymnasiums -- will open in mid-January in the hardest-hit neighborhoods, city Health Commissioner Dave Chokshi said Thursday.The CDC generally recommended that front-line health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities receive vaccines first. But an increasing number of states are expanding their eligibility lists.In Louisiana, a limited number of people ages 70 and over, as well as outpatient health care workers, can start getting vaccines with appointments at pharmacies statewide starting next week, Gov, John Bel Edwards said Thursday. The pharmacies will start receiving vaccines for these people on Monday.Georgia officials declared plans to add adults 65 and older, law enforcement officers, firefighters and first responders as eligible to get a vaccine. In West Virginia, people 80 and over could get the vaccine, starting Wednesday, the governor said. In Nevada, officials said people 75 and older will be included in Tier 2 of the state's Covid-19 vaccine distribution plan and will be vaccinated at the same time as the first group of Nevada's frontline workers. Residents between 65 and 74 years of age and people with underlying health conditions will be part of the Tier 3 group, along with the second group of essential workers. Officials in three states this week reported cases of a Covid-19 variant first identified in the UK that than prior strains.In Florida, health officials said Thursday that preliminary test results show a Martin County man in his 20s, with no history of travel, has the UK variant.California health officials announced Wednesday the variant had been detected in a 30-year-old San Diego man, who is not hospitalized and had very few social interactions during his potential contagious period. \"Understanding that it is here in San Diego really underscores the significance of what we have been asking and continue to ask everyone to do,\" said San Diego County Supervisor Nathan Fletcher. \"Wear the face covering, avoid close contact with people you don't live with, avoid large indoor settings and don't leave your home unless it is essential.\"The first known case of the UK variant in the US was in Colorado, state officials said At least 29 countries have reported cases of the variant, per CNN reporting. Data suggests the new Covid-19 variant has been circulating undetected in the US and transmitted from person to person, the CDC says.\"Public health authorities in Colorado detected a variant that was first identified in the UK, in a person who reported no travel history, the lack of reported travel history suggests this variant has been transmitting from person to person in the United States,\" said Dr. Henry Walke, the CDC's Covid-19 incident manager.Even though there is no evidence the variant causes more severe symptoms or increased risk of death, it could lead to more cases and \"put even more strain on our heavily burdened health care systems,\" Walke said.But the vaccines that are being distributed across the country will likely protect against the variant, Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Dr. Brett Giroir told CNN on Wednesday. \"We do expect -- we haven't proven it 100%, but we will soon -- we do expect that the vaccines now being administered or under development will cover this strain very well,\" Giroir said.

Brian Kemp's office said. The number of Covid-19 patients in Georgia hospitals on a given day has more than doubled since mid-November, the tracking project's data shows.

December was the deadliest month of the pandemic for the US, accounting for more than 77,500 of the country's 346,000 Covid-19 deaths, Johns Hopkins University data shows.And experts have warned daily numbers could worsen nationwide in the coming weeks, with swells stemming from gatherings and travels over the holidays. Despite repeated calls from local and state leaders for people to celebrate with only members of their household, millions of Americans opted to spend time away from home. Testing so far does not indicate a more easily transmitted variant of the coronavirus is common across the US, genomics company Helix told CNN.Only four out of 31 samples have turned up positive for the pattern of mutations first identified in the United Kingdom, Helix officials said. The mutation pattern, known as  B.1.1.7 or VUI-202012/01, was first seen in England and has been found in at least 30 countries, as well as in samples taken from people in California, Colorado and Florida.\"We cannot say with confidence when the B.1.1.7 strain emerged in the US,\" Dr. James Lu, co-founder and president of Helix, said. \"But it's not common, which indicates it has not been circulating long.\"That said, the US is not really looking hard, Lu added. \"Currently, the US is doing less sequencing than many other countries -- a recent report from (genomics database) GISAID estimated that the US is sequencing 0.3% of positive cases versus the UK that's at about 7%,\" Lu added.As the US wraps up its third week of vaccinations, Dr. Anthony Fauci made a major statement Friday about how they will proceed.The US will continue giving two doses of the current coronavirus vaccines weeks apart, and will not follow the UK's decision to potentially delay second doses, Fauci told CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen.  \"I would not be in favor of that,\" Fauci said when asked about the UK's new dosing plan. \"We're going to keep doing what we're doing.\" So far, the coronavirus vaccines approved in the US require two doses, taken  three to four weeks apart.On Wednesday, the British government  that the UK would prioritize giving the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine \"to those in the most high-risk group\" and allow the second dose to be given up to 12 weeks later. The UK adopted that strategy to give as many people as possible the first dose as quickly as possible. Even the first shot, UK medical officers have argued, would afford some amount of protection.Asked on Thursday by NBC's \"Today\" show if the US should adopt the UK's plan, Fauci had answered, \"That's under consideration.\" But he told CNN Friday that this comment had been misinterpreted.Pfizer and Moderna, the makers of the two vaccines given emergency use authorization  in the US, studied the effectiveness of two doses a few weeks apart, not a few months apart, noted Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\"The fact is we want to stick with what the science tells us, and the data that we have for both (vaccines) indicate you give a prime, followed by a boost in 21 days with Pfizer and 28 days with Moderna. And right now, that's the way we're going with it, and that's the decision that is made,\" he said Friday. \"We make decisions based on data. We don't have any data of giving a single dose and waiting for more than the normal period of time\" to give the second dose, he added.  When Fauci told NBC that following the UK's example was \"under consideration,\" he meant that some people -- not US health authorities -- were talking about it, he told CNN Friday.\"It was somewhat of a misinterpretation. I think some -- not everybody -- but people misinterpreted when I said it's under consideration [as] like we're going to change. We're not,\" he said.  People who were vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine on December 14 are due soon to take their second shots.Experts say it will be months before vaccines are widespread enough to turn the course of the pandemic. So far, more than 12.4 million vaccine doses had been distributed nationwide and more than 2.7 million had been administered,  data from Wednesday. The rollout has been slower than many officials expected, but if the US is able to catch up in 2021, widespread vaccination could be possible starting in early spring,Fauci has said. \"Let's say in April, it will be what I call 'open season,' namely, anybody who wants to get vaccinated can get vaccinated,\" Fauci saidWednesday in an  with California Gov. Gavin Newsom. \"If we then diligently vaccinate people in April, May, June, July, then we will gradually and noticeably get a degree of protection approaching herd immunity.\"If vaccinations pick up, by the time early fall rolls around, Fauci said, \"we will have enough good herd immunity to be able to really get back to some strong semblance of normality.\"CNN's Andrea Diaz, Cheri Mossburg, Haley Brink, Elizabeth Cohen, Sarah Moon, Jennifer Henderson, Nick Valencia, Lindsay Benson and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.

{"text": "As  across the US, some states are already offering shots to people other than health care workers and nursing home residents.West Virginia recently announced it would start vaccinating some of its elderly population, joining states such as Tennessee, Nevada and Florida in expanding vaccine distribution. that the first round of vaccines be allocated to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities,  adults aged 75 and older and \"frontline essential workers.\" But, in reality, states are free to make their own decisions on who gets vaccinated when.Leaders in some states have argued that focusing on vaccinating elderly people rather than younger essential workers could help reduce the burdens on their health care systems.Still, though some governors have expanded who can receive the vaccine at this time, when exactly those people get a shot depends on supplies and how localities administer them.Here's how the effort to vaccinate the most vulnerable residents is going in some places.Residents aged 80 and older became eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine beginning on Wednesday, .Doses for people in that age group were being delivered to 82 organizations, including primary care physicians, health clinics and local health departments, Justice said at a news briefing. The state is planning several vaccination clinics for people aged 80 and older at National Guard armories and other selected sites around the state, though the clinics have not yet been scheduled.But though some elderly people in the state are now eligible for the vaccine, it could be some time before they actually get one -- at the moment, demand is high and supplies are limited. The number of vaccines available depends on how many West Virginia receives each week from the federal government, according to the governor's office.\"... Patience is urged while the West Virginia National Guard's Joint Interagency Task Force finalizes plans for the widespread distribution of vaccines for West Virginians in this age category,\" Justice's office said in the news release.The Kanawha-Charleston Health Department, which serves the state's most populous county, said it eager to get a shot after the governor's announcement. By the end of Wednesday, it had run out of its allotted appointment times for the following day.The department has since announced that it expects to receive 500 doses for those 80 and older on Saturday. Eligible residents who wish to be vaccinated should call for an appointment starting at 8 a.m. on Friday, the department said.Staff at the Berkeley County Health Department  to coordinate vaccine shipments, schedule appointments and administer doses to eligible members of the community.Appointments were given on a first-come, first-serve basis and soon, the department announced that it had run out of doses -- with no word yet on when it would receive the next shipment as of Thursday morning.\"We understand the desire to get our loved ones vaccinated as soon as possible and are doing our best to ensure we get the vaccines out, based on the priority groups given, as quickly as possible,\" the department  on Thursday.In Tennessee, residents aged 75 years and older are now eligible to receive the vaccine.came as part of an update to Tennessee's current vaccination plan, which the health department said was based on new recommendations from the federal government's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and several other groups.As a part of that update, K-12 teachers and child care workers also moved ahead in the line to receive the vaccine, putting them right behind frontline health care workers.\"COVID-19 vaccines remain limited at this time, and Tennessee's allocation plan prioritizes those most at risk of illness and death from COVID-19,\" Tennessee Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said in a statement.Piercey said that some counties  vaccinating elderly residents.In Hamilton County, lines of cars with people seeking vaccines  on Thursday morning. Wait times were longer than two hours, and at around 10 a.m., the county health department  people to exit the line and come back at another time. More vaccination slots for eligible residents would likely open up starting January 5, .Georgians 65 and older, along with law enforcement officers, firefighters and first responders, will soon be among those eligible for the vaccine.State officials  that those groups could get the vaccine within the next two weeks, as long as the state had enough supplies.This latest wave of individuals will now be included in the state's Phase 1A, joining health care workers and staff and residents of long-term care facilities, who have .The state health department didn't offer much detail on how it would roll out vaccines to elderly people and first responders. But it appears that when those populations will get a shot will depend on where they live and the availability of vaccines in their area.Different parts of the state are completing the state's Phase 1A at different times, based on the number of health care workers and long-term care residents and staff they have to vaccinate, according to Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey. \"This expansion of 1a eligible vaccination criteria will allow vaccine to be administered as quickly as possible to our most at-risk populations in terms of exposure, transmission and severity,\" Toomey said in a statement.Nevada recently updated its distribution plan to prioritize people 75 and older.Individuals in that age group, meaning that they'll be vaccinated at the same time as the state's frontline essential workers. Other people in the Tier 2 category include those who work in the education, agriculture and transportation sectors.Residents between 65 and 74 years of age and people with underlying health conditions will be part of the Tier 3 group, along with a second group of essential workers.\"It's important for Nevadans to know that during the time period when COVID vaccines are limited, the allocation is based on scientific data, key ethical principles, federal recommendations, and our unique implementation challenges,\" Gov. Steve Sisolak .But it's still unclear how exactly those vaccines would be administered to those newly eligible. Immunization program manager Shannon Bennett said during a news briefing that the state's vaccine distribution plan \"continues to be fluid.\" \"As more doses of the vaccine are received in Nevada and distributed to counties, some regions of the state may move into the next tier sooner than others, based on factors such as population size and vaccine demand and the tier group,\" Bennett said.As of Tuesday, more than 25,000 doses have been administered and reported across the state, Sisolak said.Vaccination at assisted living facilities will start next week, the governor said. Florida, which has among the highest proportion of residents over the age of 65, is prioritizing vaccinating the elderly over essential workers.But in practice, getting shots in the arms of those residents has been more complicated.Gov. Ron DeSantis has left it up to each county health department to decide how it administers the vaccines. The approach has created a mass scramble for a limited number of doses, with hourslong wait times at vaccination sites and overburdened county hotlines and websites.In southwest Florida, huge lines formed overnight Tuesday after the Lee County Department of Health announced that anyone 65 and older and high-risk frontline health care workers could receive a vaccine on a first-come, first serve basis. Each of the county's seven vaccination sites had just 300 doses, leading people to camp out on lawn chairs and wait for hours.Other counties have tried to set up vaccination appointments for those who sign up online or through a hotline.In Orange County, the department of health set up an online portal to make vaccination appointments, and 30,000 appointments were scheduled in the last 24 hours. The county then said it reached capacity and closed its online portal on Wednesday.In Palm Beach County, the department of health directed people 65 and older to call an appointment hotline to get their vaccine. But the hotline can only handle 150 calls at a time and was being overwhelmed, the county said.And in South Florida, Broward Health said all of its appointments are booked until February.Some vaccine recipients said that though they considered themselves lucky, the process of distributing the shots could be improved.\"Although I'm grateful to get the vaccine, I feel that there's got to be a better way to distribute this,\" Bruce Scott, who received the vaccine at a site in Fort Myers, told CNN. \"For people that really need it, elderly that might be disabled in some way, they can't endure this process, so there's got to be a better way to manage this.\"CNN's Carma Hassan, Rebekah Riess, Gisela Crespo, Tina Burnside, Eric Levenson, Angela Barajas and Ryan Young contributed to this report.", "summary": "Though some governors have expanded who can receive the vaccine at this time, when exactly those people get a shot depends on supplies and how localities administer them."},
{"text": "If ever there was a year to toast drawing to an end, it's 2020. Over the festive period, people around the world will be raising a glass to better times ahead.Accompanying sighs of relief will likely be the subtle tinkling of ice.In researching a book on the social, medical and moral history of gin and tonic, I have imbibed -- moderately -- in bars from the Raffles Hotel in Singapore to the Morse Bar in Oxford. At each venue, my G&T was always served over ice.The history of chilled drinks goes back to antiquity. But it was the innovative \"frozen water\" trade from New England to India in the mid-19th century that popularized ice.By that time, ice had been used to chill the drinks for millennia -- but only ever for the elite.Chilled wine was all the rage in first-century Rome. Ice chunks were brought down from the summits of Mounts Vesuvius and Etna to chill the food and drink of the wealthy. Roman author Pliny the Younger ascribes to Emperor Nero both the invention of the ice bucket and the chilling of water.The  Humayun chilled summer fruit juice into a frozen sherbet in the mid-1500s. He used ice shavings from huge blocks of ice he transported on muleback from Kashmir to the capital city of Delhi. To keep it from melting, the ice was treated with potassium nitrate, otherwise known as saltpetre. By the 18th century the Mughals were so dependent upon ice for chilling both food and palaces that they built large \"baraf khana,\" or ice houses, to store the product.Across the world in 17th-century Florence, the ruling Medici family would host elaborate feasts featuring tabletop mountain ranges sculpted from ice made by chilling water in winter. They also acted as patrons to Bernardo Buontalenti, the pioneer of modern-day ice cream.But until the early 1800s, only emperors and the fabulously wealthy enjoyed the cooling effects of ice.That changed with a young man from Boston. Frederic Tudor was born in 1783 to a wealthy Boston family who summered on a pond in Rockwood, just north of the city. There, they enjoyed ice cream and chilled drinks thanks to ice harvested in winter and stored in an ice house.When his brother, William, quipped that they should harvest ice from the estate's pond and sell it in the tropics, Frederic took the notion seriously. He begged and borrowed , which included Revolutionary War heroes and merchant elite, to fund his ice enterprise.According to Tudor's diary, held at , he started shipping ice to the Caribbean island of Martinique in 1806. But islanders remained unconvinced of the benefits of chilling. The ice melted on the dock, and Tudor landed in debtors prison, owing over $5,000 to his patrons.Despite this setback, Tudor's entrepreneurial spirit was said to be undimmed. By 1826, he had garnered enough business to hire noted inventor Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth as foreman for his company -- The Tudor Ice Co. Wyeth created new types of saws, pulleys, iron grids and hoisters needed for efficient ice harvesting. He cut huge blocks of ice from Fresh Pond in Cambridge using horse-drawn ice cutters, and moved them via rail to ships in the Boston and Salem harbors.From there, the world awaited.In 1833 Tudor was approached by Samuel Austin, a merchant of silks and spices, to ship ice to Calcutta, modern-day Kolkata, 16,000 miles away, as ballast to add weight to his empty ships. Austin knew that the colonial British in India were frightened of the tropical heat, believing it to be deadly, and they often escaped to the hills during the endless summer.So on May 12, 1833, the ship Tuscany sailed from Boston for Calcutta, its hold filled with 180 tons of ice cut during the previous winter. When it arrived in Calcutta four months later, the ship still held 100 tons of ice. It meant Tudor could sell his superior ice at just 3 pence for a pound, undercutting his rivals who sold dirtier ice for much higher.When news of the ice in Calcutta circulated, British merchants in Bombay, modern-day Mumbai, excitedly raised money to build an ice house in the city's docks. Initially, demand was limited to the British and Parsis -- Persians settled in India -- but Tudor's low prices and superior commodity soon ensured that most elite Indians had access to cold beverages through their homes, clubs and restaurants.Bombay's ice trade with the U.S. was robust and continued through much of the 19th century, when, during the American Civil War, Indian cotton was used to fill the empty ice ships returning home.By 1853 India became Tudor's most lucrative destination, with Calcutta alone yielding an estimated $220,000 in profits.A few of the structures built to accommodate the trade still exist today. A decade ago, I visited an ice house in Madras, modern-day Chennai -- now known as Vivekananda House -- an engineering marvel. British military engineer Col. J.J. Collingwood borrowed a Syrian roofing technique for the ice tower -- a domed structure built using clay cylinders. This roof kept the ice very cool, as it was doubly insulated.The American naturalist Henry David Thoreau noted the trade in the winter of 1846. After observing a crew of 100 ice cutters of the Tudor Ice Co. at work on Walden Pond, , \"The sweltering inhabitants of Charleston and New Orleans, of Madras and Bombay and Calcutta, drink at my well.\"It wasn't just India. Ice cut in New England was transported to Singapore, Jamaica, Havana, New Orleans and Hong Kong.As well as being able to deliver in bulk, Tudor also marketed the quality of his ice. His claim that the ice of Wenham Lake -- 10 miles North of Boston -- was the \"purest\" in the world spawned many imitators. In 1844, a competitor, The Wenham Lake Ice Co., opened an ice store in The Strand, London, where it displayed a large block of ice with a newspaper placed behind it so that passersby could read the print through the frozen water.The Tudor Ice Co. flourished despite competition. In December 1847, The Sunbury American  newspaper reported that 22,591 tons of ice were shipped to foreign ports.In the space of 40 years, Tudor had built an ice empire, block by block, earning him the moniker the \"Ice King.\"But the icy winds of change were blowing. In 1844, the American inventor John Gorrie, a doctor who specialized in treating malaria -- also related to the birth of the G&T -- had produced a prototype of the modern air conditioner.In 1851, Gorrie received a US patent for one of the world's first ice-making machines, and by 1860 he was successful in making ice through artificial refrigeration. Meantime, the New England lakes grew dirty with pollution from coal-fired railroads.The Tudor Ice Co.'s market declined precipitously; the company closed in 1887.Tudor had died earlier in Boston, in the middle of winter of 1864. By that time, he had created what the ice industry now defines as \"the clink effect\" -- the ability of ice cubes to recall a host of positive associations -- around the world. is a professor of anthropology, religion and transnational studies at Emerson College's Marlboro Institute for Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies.Republished under a Creative Commons license from .", "summary": "While people everywhere are raising a glass New Year's weekendthis  to better times, they may not know that was the innovative \"frozen water\" trade from New England to India in the mid-19th century that popularized ice."},

Both the confirmed case and the suspected instance involve National Guard members who had been working at the Good Samaritan Society assisted living facility in Simla, about 45 miles northeast of Colorado Springs, health officials said.Neither are residents of Elbert County, and they are isolating outside the county, health director Dwayne Smith said. There is \"no indication at this point\" that this event has gone beyond the facility and into the larger community, he said.  The men were part of a team of six Guard members deployed to the Good Samaritan Society--Simla after a recent outbreak of Covid-19 caused a staff shortage.

Smith did not know when the variant could be verified or ruled out definitively in the second person, he said. He was not able to comment on travel history for the men and said the state health department notified the county about the two men on Tuesday afternoon.The \"two individuals were working at the facility in non-clinical roles,\" Smith said. \"The state health department has deployed a rapid response team to the assisted living facility in Simla to test residents and staff.\"Randy Fitzgerald, Good Samaritan Society regional vice president, said they expect results from those tests in a few days. Facility officials will \"work closely with the state while following the CDC's infection control measures,\" he added. Vaccinations will take place next week, he said.The Good Samaritan Society had a Covid-19 outbreak in the past two and a half weeks, and at least two people -- a 93-year-old man and an 88-year-old woman -- died, Smith said. A third death is being investigated, he said. The facility is home to about 25 residents.Scientists advising the UK government have estimated the variant could be up to 70% more effective at spreading than others.

{"text": "When biotech company Moderna  that it planned to offer its workforce a chance to get vaccinated with its recently authorized Covid-19 vaccine, their decision raised some eyebrows. In addition to employees, the company said it would offer shots to its board members and the \"adult household members of our team.\" Moderna's decision calls into question whether there are loopholes that will allow some people to cut the proverbial line to get their shot.\"What it appears to be is, privilege and power gaining priority access to the vaccine,\" said Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Nancy Berlinger, a research scholar at The Hastings Center, a nonprofit think tank, agreed. \"It's a rather problematic example that [the vaccine] is going to go to the VIPs first rather than to rank and file. You can imagine people are watching this pretty closely,\" she said.Vaccines against Covid-19 are largely seen as a way out of a pandemic that has wreaked havoc across the globe over the last year, but at the moment they are in very scarce supply. In the United States, two -- one developed by Moderna and the other by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer in partnership with BioNTech -- were given Emergency Use Authorization earlier in December by the US Food and Drug Administration, and several more vaccines are in the pipeline. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 12 million doses of the two vaccines have been distributed to states so far, and nearly 2.6 million doses have actually been administered, mostly to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities -- the two groups in the CDC's recommended-first tier for vaccine prioritization.In a company-issued statement, Moderna explained that it is making the shot available to its workers in the United States through a voluntary and confidential program \"to provide an additional layer of COVID-19 protection\" because Moderna workers are conducting essential services in developing, manufacturing and delivering the vaccine.As for the adult household members of people on the team, the rationale is \"to reduce the risk of absenteeism and disruption due to a COVID-19 infection in an adult household member.\"In an email to CNN, a spokesperson for Moderna said, \"We have committed specific volumes to the US Government, and we expect to meet those commitments. So these are doses beyond those commitments and sales.\" He noted Moderna has approximately 1,200 employees.This is in contrast to Pfizer, a global behemoth with almost 90,000 employees. According to a statement sent to CNN Monday, \"Pfizer plans to vaccinate its employees as groups of them become eligible per the CDC guidelines. The first group is expected to be the company's essential workers, especially in manufacturing, who are critical to the vaccine effort and the continued supply of all Pfizer medicines. There are no plans to prioritize the vaccination of our executives or board members ahead of other high-risk groups.\"In an interview from mid-December, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC that while he is very excited to get vaccinated when it's his turn, he doesn't want to be seen as \"cutting the line.\" However, he said one circumstance that would lead him to get vaccinated early would be to help increase public confidence in its safety. But that would not apply to other Pfizer employees. \"We have made the decision that if we have to do that, we will not do it with our executives. So, none of the executives or board members will cut the line, they will take it as their age and occupation type is,\" said Bourla. While none of the experts CNN spoke with for this story thought the number of vaccines that might go to Moderna employees would at all affect the vaccine supply available for general distribution, they said it was a matter of fairness and perception.\"Moderna is trying to reward the board and the company for getting the job done about creating vaccines. I'm going to say it's prioritization based on gratitude. I get it; I understand the desire to do that,\" bioethicist Arthur Caplan said. But Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and a CNN analyst, still doesn't think it passes the sniff test. \"In general, my view is, you try to stick with the high-risk folks and get agreement on who they are and get them done: nursing home folks, healthcare workers. I think that's the right way to role model by the manufacturers of vaccines. I'm not even happy that so many politicians are getting vaccinated,\" he said.Caplan is an unpaid adviser to Moderna (as well as to Janssen, maker of another vaccine candidate) but did not advise Moderna on this issue.The company can argue that those involved in the vaccine manufacturing should be considered essential workers.\"I do have concerns about prioritizing the board members [but] not the employees who are on the frontline manufacturing the vaccine,\" said Moss. Board members, Moss said, tend to have the type of job \"where it's very easy to work remotely and protect yourself. In certain other types of jobs that are essential, it's impossible to [work remotely], and that includes frontline health care workers but also the bus drivers, the teachers, people who work in grocery stores.\"  \"Vaccine, manufacturing is obviously an essential industry during a pandemic that is only going to be ended by the development, manufacturing, distribution of that vaccine -- that's pretty clear,\" Berlinger said. \"However, we're in a time of limited supply, and we have to prioritize ... across a very large country. [It's] important to keep in mind that we shouldn't conflate an essential industry with being in a high-risk environment. That is, not everybody who's involved in the manufacturing or the distribution of a vaccine is actually at high risk of either getting Covid or getting severe Covid,\" she said. Berlinger, who is lead author of The Hastings Center's Ethical Framework for Health Care Institutions Responding to Covid-19, said the Moderna situation presents an \"ethical test\" for people who have access and can jump the queue. \"Should you take advantage of your access? Should you jump the queue if you have a chance?\"\"If you can protect yourself, you should wait your turn, because this is one of those situations where the more people who use their access to go to the head of the queue, it actually starts slowing things down for other people,\" she said. Caplan also comes down on the side of waiting one's turn. \"If I were them, I'd say 'No Thanks, I'll wait until my turn comes.' It's an offer that doesn't have to be accepted,\" said Caplan. \"If you're going to take the offer, you want to be ready to stand in front of a nursing home resident or a high-risk healthcare worker and say, 'This is why I felt justified in saying yes.'\" Andrea Diaz, Shelby Lin Erdman and Amanda Sealy contributed to this story.", "summary": "When biotech company Moderna announced Tuesday that it planned to offer its workforce a chance to get vaccinated with its recently authorized Covid-19 vaccine, their decision raised some eyebrows.

In the US, 2,589,125 vaccine doses were administered from December 14 through December 30 at 9 a.m., according to data posted Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's an average of 161,820 shots per day, or a daily rate of 49 shots per 100,000 people in the country. That is significantly lower than the daily vaccination rates for Israel, the United Kingdom and Bahrain. The daily rate per 100,000 in Israel is 608, for Bahrain it's 263 and for the UK it's 60, according to data from those governments.  The US is doing better than Canada, where the daily rate is 10 doses per 100,000 people, according to researchers at the University of Toronto.In the US, there's a significant difference between the number of vaccines that have been distributed to various locations and the number of shots that have actually gone into arms.According to the CDC, 12,409,050  doses have been distributed, and 2,589,125 vaccinations have been administered between December 14 and December 30 at 9am.  \"Clearly, we need to get better at this,\" Dr. Paul Offit, an advisor to the US Food and Drug Administration on vaccine, told CNN's Bianna Golodryga Wednesday.  An administration official said it's expected the vaccination rates will improve with time.  \"I worry a little bit that talking about the rate of administration at this point is like saying, 'after opening day, my favorite player is on pace to hit 340 home runs.' We've been working with jurisdictions since September on their vaccination plans and have great confidence in our partnership with them as they ramp up,\" the official wrote in an email. \"We are so early in this effort and there is tremendous work being done at all levels to get vaccines to Americans as quickly as possible.\"  The official added that according to data reviewed by government officials, the US has distributed more vaccines total than any other country.  \"Based on publicly reported vaccination totals, the U.S. has currently vaccinated more people than any country on earth just 16 days after the first COVID-19 vaccination program began in the U.S.,\" the official wrote.

Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said the vaccination numbers are likely higher, since there is a time lag of 72 to 96 hours between the shots and when they get reported to the CDC. He said he's working to address that delay, noting that the data will \"tighten up\" as reporting becomes more routine. Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, gave the US an \"A+\" for the first part of the mission: getting vaccines distributed across the county.   When asked what grade she would give for the second part of the mission -- getting those shots into  arms -- she laughed.   \"I don't want to give them a grade,\" she said.   \"Anyone with experience with vaccines knows that logistics are the easy part,\" she added, referring to the planes and trucks that distributed the vaccines. \"Getting vaccines into arms is the hard part.\"   Organizing vaccination clinics takes time. The CDC has recommended that health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be the first two groups to receive the vaccines, and each group pose special challenges. Each group pose special challenges. Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines can make people feel sick the next day, so shots need to be staggered for health care workers. Obtaining consent for nursing home residents can be complicated, since some are not capable of giving consent, and family members must be located.   In addition, Pfizer's vaccine must be stored at ultra-low temperatures.  \"Pfizer's vaccine doesn't lend itself to large mass vaccinations, because it has very, very specific  requirements,\" said Hannan, whose group has been helping states for several months with Covid-19 vaccination plans.   Hannan pointed out that the countries that are outperforming the US -- Israel, Bahrain, and the UK -- have centralized national health services, which the US does not.  She said while reasonable people can disagree about whether a national health service is best for the US in general, there's no question that such a service helps when launching a mass vaccination campaign. In Israel, Bahrain, and the UK, \"they already have a vaccine program that's government run. They're already providing vaccines to their citizens. They're not building an entire infrastructure to do this -- they already have it,\" she said.  In the US, that public health infrastructure does not exist. For the Covid-19 vaccine campaign, legal agreements had to be arranged between the federal and state governments. Nurses had to be enrolled in a special program in order to give the vaccines. Surveys needed to be done to see which facilities had ultra-cold freezers to store Pfizer's vaccine.  \"The structure we have in the US doesn't lend itself to vaccinating 300 million people in four months,\" she said. \"This just isn't the way we do business.\"  Dr. Celine Gounder, a member of the Biden-Harris transition Covid-19 advisory board, agrees.  Tuesday, she told CNN's Jim Sciutto that health care in the US is \"very decentralized, very fragmented,\" compared to the National Health Service in the UK, \"where they have really one system that they can roll this out smoothly to. We have many, many different small systems in this country.\"  Wednesday morning,  about vaccine distribution:  \"The Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!\"   Offit, a pediatrician at the University of Pennsylvania who's advising his state on its Covid-19 plan, said this was less than helpful.   \"To sort of stand back and point a finger at the states saying 'it's all your problem' it just doesn't make any sense,\" he said.   Hannan, who worked with Operation Warp Speed for months on the vaccination implementation plan, said it was clear to her that government officials did not realize how much money, effort and organization was needed on the state level to get the vaccines into arms.   \"I just don't think they had an understanding of it,\" she said. \"There was a lack of understanding of the funding necessary to support the last mile.\"  In  and , the US Department of Health and Human Services announced awards to state totaling $480 million to help with vaccine preparedness.But Offit said more money is needed.   \"Hopefully when the new administration comes in -- which I think is more committed to making sure we can get the vaccine out there in an efficient way -- things will get better.\"  Naomi Thomas, Amir Tal, Andrew Carey, Samira Said, Michael Nedelman and John Bonifield contributed to this report", "summary": "The United States is lagging behind several other countries in its Covid-19 vaccination efforts, according to a CNN analysis of government data.

The daily rate of Covid-19 vaccinations administered in a country was calculated by dividing the total number of doses administered by the number of days since the first dose was administered.For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported to CNN that 2,589,125 doses had been administered in the US as of December 30 at 9 a.m. That's 16 days since the first shot on December 14, which averages to 161,820 shots administered each day.In Bahrain, the first shot was administered on December 17.

{"text": "The United States Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services issued new , which include recommendations for babies and toddlers for the first time. Used by health care professionals and policy makers, the guidelines dictate much of what Americans of all ages will eat over the next five years and provide a foundation for federal nutrition programs. The guidelines, which were issued Tuesday, focus on \"customizing and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations\" and \"meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages, and stay within calorie limits,\" according to the \"The science tells us that good nutrition leads to better health outcomes, and the new dietary guidelines use the best available evidence to give Americans the information they need to make healthy decisions for themselves and their families,\" said HHS Secretary Alex Azar, in a statement. \"USDA and HHS have expanded this edition of the dietary guidelines to provide new guidance for infants, toddlers, and pregnant and breastfeeding women, helping all Americans to improve their health, no matter their age or life stage.\"Despite this expanded guidance including early life stages, the guidance doesn't follow quantitative recommendations in two key areas -- alcohol and sugar intake -- addressed by an advisory committee's scientific report.The guidelines, which build on previous editions of the dietary recommendations, draw from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee's scientific report, which was released in July. However, the suggestions in the science-based report can be vetoed when the actual final recommendations take shape and are published. The committee report suggested reducing current guidance from two drinks for men and one drink a day for women to one drink a day for both women and men. However, the newly released guidelines \"did not include changes to quantitative recommendations as there was not a preponderance of evidence in the material the committee reviewed to support specific changes, as required by law,\" according to the . \"As in previous editions, limited intake of these two food components is encouraged.\"Adults can choose not to drink or drink in moderation by limiting consumption of two drinks or less in a day for men and one drink or less in a day for women, according to the new guidelines. Pregnant women should not drink, the guidelines say.\"The decision made by the federal government to maintain current dietary guidelines around alcohol intake reflects the current science and should be applauded,\" according to a statement released by the American Beverage Institute. \"The USDA and HHS rightly rejected suggestions from the advisory committee to limit alcohol intake for men, which was not supported by the evidence,\" according to the industry trade group's statement. \"New developments regarding human health should never be dismissed, but the debate should be driven by sound science, not an agenda.\"The American Institute for Cancer Research was pleased to see \"recommendations for a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and low in sugar-sweetened foods and drinks,\" said Dr. Nigel Brockton, AICR's vice president of research, in a statement.But \"retaining this flawed advice implies that two drinks per day are safe for men; that advice is contrary to the convincing evidence that intake of even less than one drink per day elevates the risk for several cancer types, including head and neck, esophageal and breast cancers,\" he said.The committee had also recommended that no amount of added sugar is OK for a baby's development. Parents and guardians should avoid added sugar in a child's diet, the committee recommended, because of the strong link to childhood obesity and future chronic health conditions.Instead the recommended amount of added sugar remained at 10% of daily calories in the guidelines, although the guidelines did add a recommendation for children under 2 years of age to consume no added sugars whatsoever.The new guidelines suggest that starting at the age of 2, a child should consume less than 10% of calories per day of added sugars while those younger than 2 years old should avoid foods or beverages with added sugars. Yet  has found that on average, infants consume a teaspoon of added sugar a day while toddlers consume about 6 teaspoons a day.Added sugars are used in processed foods and beverages to sweeten, and differ from the natural sugars that are part of a piece of fruit or glass of milk. However, while 100% fruit juice may appear to offer the same nutritional benefit as whole fruit, in reality it does not, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\"Nearly 70 percent of added sugars intake comes from five food categories: sweetened beverages, desserts and sweet snacks, coffee and tea (with their additions), candy and sugars, and breakfast cereals and bars,\" according to the committee. On a food label, added sugars can include \"brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, raw sugar, and sucrose,\" .The broadest guideline is to \"follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage.\"\"For about the first 6 months of life, exclusively feed infants human milk. Continue to feed infants human milk through at least the first year of life, and longer if desired,\" the new guidelines stated, adding that if human milk is unavailable parents and guardians should feed infants \"iron-fortified\" formula during the first year of life.Breast milk contains healthy micronutrients important to a baby's development that can, for the most part, be influenced by a woman's diet and supplement use. This first guideline also suggests introducing \"nutrient-dense\" foods to infants at 6 months of life, along with \"potentially allergenic foods.\"\"As focused on the Birth-24 months, generally we're pleased with the recommendations and the key messaging of making 'every bite count,'\" said pediatrician Dr. Steven Abrams, who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition, via email. \"Recommendations align well with AAP policy supporting exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months with introduction of peanut-containing foods at 4 to 6 months in infants at high risk of peanut allergy.\"Possible areas of nutritional concern in baby's development revolve around iron, zinc and vitamin D. Because breast milk doesn't contain adequate amounts of vitamin D unless the mother is supplementing at high levels, the guidelines recommend providing infants with supplemental vitamin D beginning soon after birth.Introducing peanuts, eggs, cow's milk products, tree nuts, wheat, soy, and shellfish and fish with other complementary foods could reduce a child's risk of developing a food allergy.\"FARE is thrilled to see the inclusion of more comprehensive dietary guidance around the early introduction of egg and peanut for infants and toddlers,\" said Lisa Gable, CEO of nonprofit organization Food Allergy Research & Education, in a statement.And for those 12 months through older adulthood, follow a healthy dietary pattern across the life span to meet nutrient needs.The guidance states that a \"healthy dietary pattern\" consists of nutrient-dense forms of foods and beverages across all food groups, in recommended amounts, and within calorie limits. These foods consist of protein, oils, dairy, vegetables, grains and fruits.This pattern includes dark green, red and orange vegetables, beans, peas, lentils and other starches, whole fruits and whole grains, as well as vegetable oils, lean meats, poultry, eggs, nuts, fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt and cheese.And lastly, the final guideline is to \"limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, and limit alcoholic beverages, at every life stage.\" A child should consume less than 10% of calories per day of saturated fat at the age of 2. Sodium consumption should be less than 2,300 milligrams per day, and even less for kids under 14 years old.\"Strategies to lower sodium intake include cooking at home more often; using the Nutrition Facts label to choose products with less sodium, reduced sodium, or no-salt-added, etc.; and flavoring foods with herbs and spices instead of salt based on personal and cultural foodways,\" according to the new guidelines.The limits on sodium, however, have not shifted from the 2015 report.The American Institute for Cancer Research also suggested that the recommendations don't fully represent research about the health benefits of reducing the intake of processed meats and added sugars beyond the 10% of calories recommended by the new guidelines.The guidelines don't touch on the topic of red meat -- a major supplier of saturated fat in the American diet and a huge player in the argument over food sustainability and . And the new guidance doesn't say much about processed foods.Instead, the guidelines suggest replacing processed or high-fat meats, like hot dogs, sausages and bacon, with seafood or beans, peas and lentils to meet protein recommendations. They also suggest that the majority of meat and poultry a person consumes should be fresh, frozen or canned, and in lean forms, like chicken breast or ground turkey, rather than processed meats like ham or other deli meat. Overall, the guidelines feel old-fashioned and very similar to those released in 2015, said nutrition researcher Marion Nestle, who has authored numerous books on food politics and marketing, including 2015's \"Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning).\"\"They've also hidden or diminished the importance of the main food sources of sugar, saturated fat and salt,\" said Nestle, who is the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. And apparently the main food to avoid if you want to limit your salt and saturated fat intake? Sandwiches. \"'Ultraprocessed' is the new way of talking about foods that should not be consumed regularly or in large amounts — tons of evidence has come in within the last five years,\" Nestle said. But the word doesn't appear in the guidelines. Those issues aren't addressed, critics say, because the independence of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee was removed by the federal government.\"For the first time in the 40-year history of the Dietary Guidelines, the agencies — USDA and HHS — set the scientific agenda, not the committee,\" Nestle said.Nestle was on the advisory committee in 1995, a time when the committee decided on the agenda, did the research and wrote the guidelines. That changed in 2005, when it was decided that the committee would write the scientific report while agencies would author the guidelines. This time, the agencies also set the scientific agenda, making it a \"completely political process,\" Nestle said. The agencies appointed the committee, but largely ignored their stricter recommendations, she said.Going forward, Nestle believes that we don't need another repetitive and conservative set of guidelines like the ones released Tuesday. \"We need to look at what the world looks like in 2021 and make changes based on that.\"Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner from 2017 to 2019,, \"These guidelines are intended as a public health tool. As such, we need to restructure how they're decided upon; and put public health agencies like FDA, ASH (the American Society of Hematology) in charge. While USDA could have a role, decisions should be made fully in a public health context.\"", "summary": "The United States issued new dietary guidelines that included recommendations for babies and toddlers for the first time but did not reduce sugar and alcohol intake."},

This classic Italian cocktail works for New Year's Eve because it combines sparkling wine with slightly bitter aperitifs. This range of herb- and botanical-infused liqueurs is lower in alcohol than hard liquors like gin and vodka but has \"big, punchy flavors,\" Carducci explained. \"It tricks the palate that we're drinking something heavier than we are.\"Even better, \"you can't find a simpler drink to make.\" Carducci likes the Venetian spritz for its easy-to-remember 3-2-1 ratio: 3 parts prosecco, 2 parts Select Aperitivo or Amaro Montenegro, and 1 part soda water or seltzer.

{"text": "Many of the ideas and metaphors in popular culture about how the human brain works don't stand up to scrutiny. That's a prevailing theme in Lisa Feldman Barrett's new book \",\" released in November. Barrett is a university distinguished professor of psychology at Northeastern University in Boston, where she directs the school's Interdisciplinary Affective Science Laboratory. She also holds appointments at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. She has made significant contributions in helping to understand the fundamental nature of emotion. Her pioneering research in neuroscience has landed her among the top 1% of most cited scientists in the world, and a 2019  in neuroscience.Here Barrett answers seven and a half questions about how brain science can help you have a more productive and prosperous life. Yes, it was a Jedi mind trick at work. Did it stick in your head? Actually, in the first draft of the book, it had seven lessons. But an early reader suggested splitting the first lesson into two parts, which is the lesson on brain evolution. The first half lesson is really just a short peek into a much larger story on brain evolution so I thought calling it \"a half\" sounded reasonable. Having a science book called \"Seven and a Half Lessons\" does indicate that I hope this is supposed to be fun and entertaining.Think about the last time you were drinkinga glass of water. Within a couple of seconds you feelless thirsty. And that's actually a remarkable thing, because the water that you drink doesn't reach your bloodstream for about 20 minutes. How is that water quenching your thirst so quickly? And the answer is because your brain has learned from past experience that drinking water makes you less thirsty, so your brain is making a prediction. It predicts that you'll feel less thirsty, and that prediction becomes your experience, and so your thirst diminishes quickly. And so really what your brain is doing is predicting -- the brain actually operates by prediction all the time. The process is largely invisible to you. But it's happening under the hood and everything you've experienced is some combination of what's in your head. The question is really whether a brain is a slave to itself, or is there an opportunity for free will?Free will is a topic that philosophers have been debating forever. A little book isn't gonna settle it, but from understanding how the brain predicts, we can shed some light on the question of free will. It's true that your brain predicts your actions and launches your actions before you're aware of them. Think about a baseball player about to launch into a swing well before he consciously needed to. If he waited until later, he wouldn't have enough time to swing, and he'd always miss the ball. Prediction is crucial. We don't experience our life this way, but this is actually what's happening.Your brain predicts and launches your actions based on data, namely, based on your past experience.The baseball player takes into account what he knows about the pitcher and the conditions of his own body to make a really good prediction about where the ball is going to be in a moment from now. That's where he swings and is prepared to hit. This example reveals something important: If you curate useful experiences for yourself, you can change your brain in future predictions. That is a form of free will we rarely discuss. You are always cultivating your past, which helps you control who you will be in the future. You have a predicting brain that launches your actions and prepares your experience based on what you have learned or experienced yourself in the past. So the best way to stick to a New Year's resolution is to practice it in advance so that your brain learns to issue new predictions about your New Year's resolution in an automatic way. It's like driving. At first when you practice something it requires a lot of attention -- you have to really work at it. But over time, if you practice it becomes automatic and effortless, really. So, if your resolution is to spend more time with your kids or to learn a new musical instrument, you can start today, you don't have to wait for the New Year.And you can practice the skill, cultivate the experience as much as you can, giving your brain lots of practice to predict automatically in the future. Again, it's this idea that you are the architect of your experience. If you seed your brain with new experiences today, this will encourage your brain to predict differently tomorrow.I have several New Year's resolutions. One of my goals is to engage with people who have very different points of view from me, politically, to be curious, instead of being judgmental or close minded. I think that this is the most patriotic thing I can do right now in our current politically charged moment. So you can think about it as an investment that you're hoping to see a return on. It's a worthy investment. So, I'm gonna try hard to go for communication, over affirmations, that's my goal. My other resolution is to knit because it's actually a skill that is somewhat meditative. I think it's probably going to be as hard for me to learn that as it is to talk to people who disagree. My main recommendation is to be curious about other people's perspectives, to focus on communication and not affirmation.In every moment your brain is running a sort of budget for your body. But instead of budgeting money, it's budgeting water, salt, glucose and other resources so that your body has what it needs at the right time to keep you alive and well. This budgeting process also produces your most basic feelings, like feeling pleasant or unpleasant, feeling comfortable or distressed, feeling calm or activated. So when you encounter political ideas that you dislike, there's a lot of uncertainty. Your brain is using some extra resources to process them. It's like a withdrawal from your body budget because things that are unpredictable or dislikable are more expensive metabolically. This withdrawal can feel unpleasant. The two most expensive things your brain can do is  and learn something new. When you exercise, you spend a lot of metabolic resources. You're making a big expenditure but you think about that as an investment in a healthier brain in the future.The same thing is true about learning something new. The more that you learn, the more you expose yourself to new things and the more new things you've learned, the more flexible and resilient you are in your own life. The idea that humans have a primitive lizard brain with base instincts is a very popular story, but it's just a story. We can trace it all the way back to ancient Greece, but it became popular in the mid 20th century, when the best technology that neuroscientists had available for examining brains was a microscope. And the naked eye. When you look at a lizard brain and at a mammalian brain, like a rodent's, and you look at a primate brain, and they work, you know, like a monkey or chimp and then you look at the human brain, we see their brains look very different to the naked eye. But today, using advanced tools that we have for examining the molecular genetics inside of brain cells, we can see clearly that the human brain didn't evolve by growing the parts to layer on top of the lizard brain. Instead, we've discovered something much more interesting, which is that the brains of all mammals, and possibly all vertebrates, actually, are built from a single manufacturing plan. What this means is that your brain and my brain, and a rat's brain and a dog's brain, and maybe a lizard brain and some bird brains, all look different. But they have the same basic complement of neurons. Those neurons may arrange themselves in different ways.As brains get bigger over evolutionary time, they reorganize themselves like companies. That's the neurobiologist George Streeter's saying, that brains are like companies: They reorganize as they grow.  Remember, your brain is always running a budget for your body. Sometimes your feelings are at front and center in your attention, and sometimes they're in the background. But they're always there, which means that rationality cannot be an absence of feeling. Your brain wiring guarantees that this is the case. Sometimes your brain  as your brain explains what's going on inside your own body in relation to the world. Sometimes emotions are actually rational, like when you feel afraid because you're in danger. And sometimes thinking is not rational, like when you scroll through social media for hours telling yourself that you're bound to come across something important.There are examples where emotion is a deep form of wisdom that you can draw on to help guide your decisions. It's important to understand that, both from a neuroscience standpoint and just from a common sense standpoint.It's not really useful to think about the human brain or the human mind as a battleground between thinking and feeling for the control of your behavior. The idea that thinking and feeling are distinct mental events, that rationality and emotion are in a constant battle for control of your behavior is a very Western story. These are not universal elements of human nature.

The CDC has a long list of . Among them: -- Have a virtual party with friends and celebrate the countdown together.-- Plan a neighborhood countdown to midnight. Neighbors can go outside and cheer from the front of their homes.-- Pick up a special meal from a local restaurant to share with your household.-- Watch celebrations on TV or online.-- Call, text or leave voicemails for friends and family wishing them a happy new year.If you already have plans for a big party, don't be afraid to cancel them to ensure a healthy start to 2021. \"It's okay if you decide to postpone or cancel your gathering,\" . \"Do what's best for you.\"And don't worry, this will probably be the last time health experts beg you to hunker down for New Year's Eve.\"Once we start getting vaccinated, we'll be in a much better position by the middle of next year,\" Hotez said. \"And we can have a much happier New Year's 2022.\" ", "summary": "Yes, 2020 was largely a dumpster fire.

Jared Polis announced Tuesday.It is the first known case of the UK coronavirus variant in United States.The man, who is in his 20s and in isolation in Elbert County, has no travel history, Polis' office said in a news release.\"We will closely monitor this case,\" Polis said, \"as well as all COVID-19 indicators, very closely.\"The statement said public health officials are working to identify potential contacts and potential cases through contact tracing interviews.\"An unknown travel history mean that this person picked it up the community,\" Dr. Atul Gawande, a member of the Biden-Harris transition Covid advisory board and a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told CNN.Health authorities from around the world have said the variant does not appear to be more deadly than previously identified Covid-19 strains.\"We know it is a more contagious variant and that's a serious concern if it is only just now beginning to spread, given that our hospitals and ICUs, in particular, are already being filled,\" Gawande said.But the mitigation factors -- social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing -- that work against the virus also work against this variant, he said.\"If this mutation, this mutated virus, which is more contagious, is not widespread yet and beginning to spread, that means it will be even more important to follow the approaches we know work,\" he said. Many countries have banned flights from the United Kingdom. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently announced passengers from London to the United States will need a negative coronavirus test from the previous 72 hours.The variant has been around since September, and US health officials have said in recent days as it became prevalent in the United Kingdom that it is probably already in the United States.The United States will likely see \"homegrown variants\" of the virus, similar to the UK variant, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.Hotez said that if the United States starts performing more virus genomic surveillance, it will likely identify additional strains of the virus in the US.Public Health England said initial analysis showed that while the variant appears to be more transmissible, there is no evidence it is linked to a higher risk of hospital admission or death.The number of patients hospitalized across the US with is the highest it's ever been -- and at this rate health experts warn some hospitals may have to ration nurses, respirators and care.And in Los Angeles County, where a crush of cases have , at least five hospitals have already turned patients away because of oxygen supply issues, officials say.\"The surges and the impact on our ICUs across the country is absolutely devastating. ... This is the nightmare scenario we worked so hard to prevent,\" Hotez, an infectious disease specialist, told CNN on Tuesday about the hospital situation nationwide.The United States reported 124,686 coronavirus patients in hospitals Tuesday, the most reported on a given day during the pandemic, according to the . The country's proportion of ICU patients who have coronavirus also has shot up, from 16% in September to 40% last week, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. \"When you run out of capacity, physicians and bioethicists in these hospitals will need to decide which patients are salvageable -- potentially salvageable -- and which patients aren't,\" CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner said Monday.December already has been the country's . And with travel , health experts anticipate the spread of the virus will increase and send hospitalizations surging further.In Los Angeles County, problems with supplying oxygen to rooms led at least five hospitals to declare an \"internal disaster\" Sunday, which included turning an unspecified number of patients away, county health services director Dr. Christina Ghaly said.Though there were multiple issues, the problem generally wasn't an absolute shortage of oxygen, she said. One issue was that aging infrastructure pumping the oxygen to patient rooms couldn't keep up with the high number of patients needing it.She didn't immediately identify the hospitals with those issues. Other capacity issues, meanwhile, are plaguing county medical facilities.A further spike in cases would put Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital in Los Angeles in the position of needing to ration care, CEO Dr. Elaine Batchlor said Monday.\"If we continue to see an increase in the number of Covid patients, we may be forced to do something that, as health professionals, we all really just loathe having to even think about,\" Batchlor told CNN's Brooke Baldwin.Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital will not turn patients away, Batchlor said, but staff may have to employ techniques that have been used in war.\"We use what in the battlefield is called triage techniques, which is doing an assessment of each person's needs and prognosis and using scarce resources with patients that are most likely to benefit from them,\" she said.Already, resources are being used in unconventional ways to accommodate the surge.\"Our staff has been incredibly adept and flexible in accommodating increasing numbers of patients, so as you heard, we have five tents outside of the hospital,\" Batchlor said. \"We have patients in our conference room, in our chapel.\"Many gurneys are taken into the gift shop, she said.While Batchlor didn't specify how many new patients have Covid-19, the increase in their numbers is putting stress on all care.At Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, California, nurses who usually care for one or two patients are now caring for three or four, infectious disease specialist Dr. Kimberly Shriner told CNN on Sunday.\"We have a limited number of ventilators, we have a limited number of ICU beds,\" Shriner said, adding that a team including a bioethicist, a community member, a physician, a nurse and an administrative leader will decide how to divide those resources if it comes down to it.Ghaly, the county health services director, said some hospitals are attending to patients who are still in ambulances.\"Those patients are being cared for and treated in the ambulance as if it's part of the emergency room bay,\" Ghaly said.January's coronavirus numbers could be worse than December's because travel surged for the holidays, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday.He wishes so many hadn't traveled -- but those who did can still decide to limit potential spread by restricting who they congregate with, he said.\"For those who have already done the travel, the thing to do now is to try to not congregate with large numbers of people in social settings like dinners,\" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Tuesday.\"Once you get to large numbers of people at a dinner inside, poor air ventilation and circulation, that's when you get in trouble,\" he said. \"That's what we're concerned about -- that in addition to the (current) surge, we're going to have an increase superimposed upon that surge, which could make January even worse than December.\"Air travel has been .

{"text": "If you're feeling weary as 2020 comes to an end, you may be in need of some relaxation. Let's face it: This year has been a challenge for so many. Whether it was the transition from in-person to online activities or keeping up with new health safety guidelines, countless people likely had some trouble adjusting to our new way of living. So how about we take some time for ourselves in the New Year?Yoga is the perfect workout if you're looking for more self-care.  have shown that yoga actually reduces the production of stress hormones such as cortisol. Because of this phenomenon, many people find themselves feeling at peace after a relaxing and light yoga routine. Regularly practicing yoga can become your new stress reliever, especially if you choose the right poses. Light and simple poses are the way to go if you're looking for a restorative routine. This type of yoga may improve fatigue and overall well-being, according to . Because the stresses of 2020 are enough to leave you both mentally and physically drained, I've devised a yoga routine that pinpoints relieving stress and restoring well-being. Trust me, we all deserve it!For each yoga pose, breathe in and out through your nose.Get back in the groove. This pose is basically a squat. It opens up the hips and inner thighs.Open your feet as wide as your hips and turn the toes out toward the front corner of the mat. Bring the palms together at your chest, and bend the knees out to the sides as you lower down into a squat. Squat as low as you can so that your butt is almost touching the floor. Press your upper outer arms into your inner thighs to open more deeply. Take a few breaths here. Because squatting is a natural position, you can focus on your breath and body. Being mindful of your breath while in this pose can help your body relax. Squatting also stretches your hips, hamstrings and lower body without causing strain. After a few breaths, you'll be on your way to balance and restoration. This pose helps with restoration and stress relief. Standing on a yoga mat with your feet as wide as your hips, slowly fold forward, hinging at your hips. Allow your arms, head and neck to dangle down.Reach your arms toward the mat and allow your chin to drop toward your chest. You'll feel a stretch in the backs of your legs, but if this is too intense or if your low back is stiff, feel free to bend your knees.Hold this pose for about a minute. You can shake your head gently \"yes\" and \"no.\" To come out of this pose, slowly roll up one vertebra at a time with your head being the last thing to come up.For a variation, try the head-to-knee forward fold: On the mat, start by sitting down with your legs straight in front of you. Bend one leg so that your foot is flat against the inner thigh of your other leg and the knee is out to the side. Fold forward at your waist so that you are reaching for the foot that is straight in front of you. Hold for a few breaths. Then, alternate legs. This pose is a variation of the forward bend and helps to stretch hamstrings, hips and back. By straightening one leg at a time, you're able to gain a deeper stretch at a slower pace. This pose has been to calm the racing thoughts and reduce stress, helping to restore your mind from any lingering worries.  The pigeon pose helps to gently open and stretch the hips and glutes. Begin on all fours, with your hands and knees on the yoga mat. Step your right foot forward and then bend your right knee out to the side. Line up your right shin up with the front of the mat.  Place your right ankle in front of your left hip. Move your left leg so that it is straight behind you with your toes pointed. Stay upright, or walk the hands forward over the right leg. Take a few deep breaths, and then switch sides. This pose has been known to calm the mind and improve hip flexibility. Once again, focusing on one side of your body at a time allows for a deeper stretch. The slow pace of this pose also allows you to focus on more than the position that you're in. Instead, you can focus on how your body feels and the breath that enters and leaves your body. A lot of emotional energy can be held in the glutes, so many people find a release after coming out of this pose both physically and emotionally. Elevating your legs above your head is one of the most relaxing positions in yoga. This is an advanced yoga pose; only do this pose once you've loosened up your body. And if you're a beginner looking to gradually ease into a new pose, what follows the steps are instructions for a modification.Lie on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Then bend your knees in toward your chest and rock backward so that your legs go over your head. Support your low back by pressing your hands into your back with your fingertips up toward the middle of your back. Pull your abs in and bend the knees to bring them over your head and then straighten the legs up toward the sky. Squeeze your inner thighs together and point your toes.This pose helps with shoulder and neck flexibility and has been shown to calm nerves. Because your body is above your head, blood flows to the brain, reducing fatigue and creating a calming sensation. New to yoga, or looking for a modification? Simply lie next to a wall and reach your legs up along the wall with your low back on the ground. This pose opens up the inner and outer hips. Begin by sitting up on a yoga mat. Bring your legs in, bending your knees with the soles of your feet touching and knees out to the sides. Hold onto your ankles (or onto your shins if you can't reach). Once in this butterfly position, recline your upper body so that you are lying on the mat. Keep your hands straight out to the side or on your stomach. Take a few deep breaths.In addition to increasing hip flexibility, the reclined butterfly also helps to bring your body into a calm state. Because you are laying down while stretching, your body is more likely to relax, allowing you to focus on your breathing. Commit to de-stressing in the New Year. Take a break from intense workouts by doing these poses once a week or anytime you just need some relaxation.", "summary": "Fitness expert Stephanie Mansour, PBS host of \"Step It Up With Steph,\" has devised an easy yoga routine for energy.

{"text": "Adventurer Eric Larsen has faced some of the . He has been to the South Pole and the North Pole, and he stood atop Mount Everest. Traveling by ski, dogsled and bicycle, he has crossed snowy landscapes scoured by howling winds.\"Worst-case scenario, the ambient temperature is minus 50 and you're dealing with wind chills that are even colder than that,\" said Larsen, who lives in Colorado. \"It can be a complete whiteout, like being on the inside of a ping-pong ball.\" And while Larsen loves exploring, he's not shy about his fondness for staying cozy. \"I do not like being cold,\" he said. He's not the only one. Just 11% of Americans say winter is their favorite season, according to a  conducted in 2005. But maybe with the right cold-weather gear, that perspective could change. Across 15 years of exploring the chilliest places in the world, Larson has learned that it's all about what you wear. \"There's no such thing as cold weather,\" he said. \"Only not enough layers.\" That's not just true for hardy adventurers. The key points of dressing for harsh conditions, Larsen said, are relevant for people braving frigid city streets, too. As the world copes with cold weather amid an ongoing pandemic, cold-weather clothing has new urgency. Experts say the safest way to socialize is outdoors, where the virus doesn't spread as quickly as it does inside. In some places, kids are attending school in outdoor classrooms. The outdoors aren't just a pandemic backup plan, either. Spending time outside makes us happy, , an effect that doesn't go away when it's cold. In snowy places, a sled or snowshoes can turn the landscape into a giant playground. Even if there is no snow on the ground, winter walks mean encounters with beloved birds, such as the dark-eyed junco, that only appear this time of year. It's beautiful and fun: but only if you dress for the cold. Whether you're seeing loved ones around a winter campfire, hiking with family or playing at recess, staying warm is important. So, we asked the polar explorer for his cold-weather clothing tips, then got some extra advice from an ultra-runner and a camping pioneer. Here's what they said about getting dressed this winter.A thin, light base layer is the first thing that goes on your body, Larsen said, where it will wick moisture away from your skin. That means you won't have a damp coating of sweat cooling you off. \"The base layer is really, really important,\" agreed Mirna Valerio, who lives in Vermont. Valerio, who has completed more than a dozen ultramarathons — races longer than 26.2 miles — said a good base layer is key to staying warm in fluctuating weather conditions. \"I'm looking for something that's fitted, that's not loose,\" she explained. \"It needs to be really close to my skin.\" A base layer can be made from natural materials such as wool or silk, or a synthetic material designed specifically for the outdoors. Cotton is out: If it gets wet, cotton can make you dangerously cold. Valerio, who once blogged under the handle \"FATGIRLRUNNING,\" said it's key to find a layer that fully covers your torso, which can be challenging for people with bigger bodies.\"It needs to be long enough where it doesn't roll up,\" she said, noting that plus-size people should avoid brands that simply scale up their \"straight size\" clothing, rather than designing specifically for each body type. Valerio wears silk long underwear from L.L. Bean, a sponsor, but also recommends plus-size options from brands prAna and Oiselle.The next thing to go on your body will be a bit thicker. Just like the insulation on a house, the midlayer is what keeps all the heat in.  A \"midlayer\" could be a wool sweater, a lightweight down jacket or a fleece, said Valerio, who usually opts for wool. \"That technical wool is going to help regulate your body temperature,\" she said, noting that wool will keep you warm even when it's wet. Down jackets are popular, too, because they're light, warm and easy to pack. If that's what you choose, just make sure the jacket doesn't get wet, because it will lose much of its insulating power.\"I actually really love being in the rain,\" said Ambreen Tariq, an avid outdoorswoman and the founder of social media initiative , which promotes diversity in public lands. \"But waterproof clothing is really, really important for getting through those times.\"That's where the third component of layering comes in: a weatherproof coat that will keep out the elements, so your inner insulation stays dry and warm. Tariq, who lives in Washington, DC, emphasized that it's a good idea to find a coat with a hood to prevent cold, rain and snow from seeping into your neck and head area. There are two key words to keep in mind when shopping for this layer. \"Waterproof\" coats, which are generally a bit more expensive, are intended to keep all moisture out. Pick up one of these if you're facing heavy rain.A \"water-resistant\" coat, on the other hand, is made to repel lighter rain and snow. This can be a good option if you want some wind protection and you don't expect to see much precipitation. All three experts emphasized that wearing a warm hat goes a long way toward keeping you warm when it's chilly out. On really cold days, you can add a buff or gaiter that wraps around your neck. Hands and feet are equally important. Start with roomy shoes or boots, then add a pair of warm, wooly socks for toasty feet. Still cold? Larsen recommended sliding an insole into your shoes to add a bit more insulation. And always keep a pair of gloves on hand: They're easy to throw in a bag when heading out the door and will contribute to your overall comfort in a major way. But staying warm on a cold day doesn't stop with getting dressed, the experts said. It sounds nonintuitive, but you also need to know when to start taking clothes off.\"I'm hyper focused on not getting too hot,\" Larsen, the polar explorer, said. If you get sweaty, that sweat will eventually cool off and steal your heat. \"As you start getting warmer, as you potentially start sweating, you need to start removing some of those layers or modifying those layers.\"Coat with zippered vents under the arms let you add some ventilation, or you can open the front of your coat. Otherwise, simply strip off an extra layer to keep your cool. If you're out moving around, Larsen said you'll need to adjust your clothing throughout the day. You'll warm up when working hard, and cool back down when you stop to sit down or eat a snack. Paying attention to how you're feeling is key. \"You want to make sure you're taking care of yourself, and your own body, first,\" he said. \"You need to be mindful.\"• There are three basic components of winter dressing: a moisture-wicking base layer, a warm middle layer and a weatherproof outer layer.• Don't forget a hat and hood! Keeping your head warm helps raise your core temperature, too.• Throw some gloves in your bag. It's a wintertime habit your hands will thank you for.• Adjust throughout the day. If you're getting warm and sweaty, remove a layer to ensure you don't get cold later.

I'm not certain.\"He said the federal government needs to step up and states need to get funding for the administering of the vaccines.Trump administration officials told CNN that vaccine distribution is on track and blamed the gap on a lag in reporting data.Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir said he expects  and that the US is on track to distribute 20 million vaccine doses by the first week of January.\"Of course, we need to be doing a better job, but all vaccine programs start somewhat slow,\" Giroir told CNN's Jake Tapper. He expects 30 million more doses to be distributed in January and potentially up to 50 million more in February. Both of the vaccines require two doses to be fully effective. Two new vaccines for Covid-19 may be authorized for use in the US in the coming months.The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine that the  may be authorized for emergency use in the US in April, according to Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed.That vaccine is in Phase 3 trials in the US, Slaoui said, and the vaccine is being manufactured ahead of the potential authorization.\"If everything goes well, that read-out and emergency use authorization may be granted somewhere early in April,\" he added. \"By that time, several tens of millions of doses of this vaccine will have been manufactured.\"In addition, Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine may be authorized for emergency use in February and could be a \"game changer\" for the US, Slaoui said. Phase 3 trial recruitment for this vaccine has been completed.\"We feel more and more confident that readout of efficacy will take place during the month of January, and very likely an EUA submission will take place during the month of January,\" said Slaoui, referring to The US has already authorized the use of two vaccines -- one from Pfizer/BioNTech and one from Moderna.The vaccinations, and the reinforcements potentially on the way, come at a critical time. The US set two more devastating Covid-19 records as it counted down the hours to the end of what has been a calamitous year.On Tuesday, the US recorded more than 3,700 deaths linked to the virus, a chilling new high. There were almost 3,700 additional deaths reported by Wednesday evening, according to Johns Hopkins University.The US on Wednesday also reported the most Covid-19 hospitalizations, with 125,220 patients nationwide, according to the On a state level, Texas officials reported record-high hospitalizations Wednesday, with 11,992 Covid-19 patients across the state, while Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Tuesday a temporary hospital with an additional 60 beds could open within the next few days. In Los Angeles County, hospitalizations are at an all-time high of 7,415, an increase of more than 500 in two days. With the surge in patients, some hospitals are running out of oxygen tanks. \"I actually think we're now beyond waves or surges and this is a viral tsunami that we are now experiencing,\" epidemiologist Dr. Robert Kim-Farley said. Ambulances are sometimes waiting with patients -- with Covid-19 or other problems -- outside hospitals, the county's department of health services said. \"The demand is leading to lines of ambulances waiting to offload patients and hospitals having to open up new areas to treat patients,\" an emailed statement said. \"We expect the ambulance diversion to continue as numbers of COVID-19 cases -- and the numbers of people needing hospital care -- continue to rise.\" And experts have warned the US likely will see  in January fueled by this month's holiday gatherings and travel. And while the ongoing vaccinations continue to offer hope, it likely be months before the country will begin to see a meaningful impact, experts said. One state did report good news with hospitalizations. Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb told reporters he is lifting the statewide pause on elective surgeries because recent data show the hospital census is becoming more manageable.Health officials in a Colorado county believe they've found a  variant from the  -- one that experts have said may be especially contagious.The news came a day after the first known case of the variant in the US  in Elbert County.

{"text": "Despite warnings from public health officials, millions of Americans traveled over the Christmas holiday. The US Transportation Security Administration reported that  passed through airport security checkpoints nationwide Sunday. This record-breaking development in pandemic air travel comes as the United States has surpassed 19 million coronavirus infections. And December marks  since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, explains how people can still take precautions to keep themselves safe and to reduce the spread of Covid-19 in their home communities.People should keep in mind the concept of cumulative risk, that risk is additive: The more high-risk activities you participate in, the greater your likelihood of contracting Covid-19 (and, if you are an asymptomatic carrier, to inadvertently infect other people). Just because you've engaged in one high-risk event doesn't mean you should engage in others. So let's say that you had Christmas dinner with extended family and friends. That doesn't mean you should also now go to a bar or crowded New Year's Eve party. For the remainder of the holiday, if you've traveled, you should try to reduce risk in other ways. See people outdoors only, households separated at least 6 feet apart. If you have to be indoors, make sure you have masks on the entire time. Stay away from settings where others have their masks off and are not abiding by physical distancing guidelines. Take every precaution when traveling. You may have had risk from the one or two activities you already engaged in, but you can still prevent further risk the rest of the holiday.Yes. You could have had risk through getting together with others at celebrations and through the travel itself. The last thing we would want is for travelers to then seed coronavirus once they return home, to their family, colleagues, friends and neighbors. I recommend to quarantine for seven days and to get a coronavirus test at that point. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) says that you can get a coronavirus test three to five days after travel. That's probably enough time for the test to turn positive after exposure, though waiting for seven days will pick up even more infections. If you're unable to get a test because of limited testing in your community, you need to quarantine for a full 10 days. Unfortunately, yes. There is such a high level of coronavirus in most parts of the country that being in a crowded airport and plane exposes travelers to risk. Loved ones are also just as likely as strangers to have coronavirus, so if you were indoors with friends or family who don't live in your household, you were also engaging in a high-risk activity.Our hospitals are at the brink. One in five hospitals are reporting that their ICUs are full or nearly full. When hospitals are filled, it's not only patients with coronavirus who suffer; other patients who need care for heart problems or who come in after car accidents also get delays in their care. Hospitals are the last line of defense. The community is the first line of defense. Quarantine and testing after a high-risk exposure is the best thing you can do to prevent further overburdening our health care system.Travel itself is high risk unless you drove with just your household in a car. Buses, planes and trains, especially for holiday travel where there are so many other travelers, would have risk of coronavirus exposure.Many people, after traveling, probably gathered in some way with their relatives and friends. If the only gatherings were outdoors, following physical distancing, that's not high risk. However, if there were any indoor gatherings, those would be high risk. Consider activities that would be normal in pre-pandemic times. People sitting around the dinner table, masks off, eating for long periods of time. Or watching TV together sitting on a couch or having drinks while preparing a meal. These are all high-risk activities.There are nuances here. If, for example, everyone that you saw has also been quarantining and did not see anyone else for at least 10 days before getting together, that would substantially reduce risk. But if everyone has just had one negative test alone, that in itself is not enough. A negative test must be accompanied by at least seven days of quarantine before that. If in doubt, you should consider your exposure to those you saw indoors to be high risk and quarantine accordingly.When you return, you should quarantine from them to prevent transmitting coronavirus to them. (And, if they traveled themselves or were engaged in high-risk activities, too, they should also quarantine.) Quarantining from people you share a home with isn't easy, but it can be done. Try to avoid going to shared spaces at the same time, like the living room. When in those spaces, wear a mask. Wipe down commonly used surfaces like door handles or faucets. Keep windows open as much as you can. Take extra precaution if you live with someone who is at high risk for illness, if they are older or have chronic medical conditions.No. A quarantine should be strict: Do not go into public spaces where you could infect others. That means not going to grocery stores or to work. Kids should not go to school or day care. And definitely do not get together with anyone else who is not in your immediate household during this time.Even those who are previously healthy could get ill themselves. They could certainly spread coronavirus to others unknowingly. Our health care system is already so strained that we really cannot afford further escalation in infections. This is particularly true in areas that are hotspots, but many other areas are on the cusp of having explosive spread, too.That's why it's up to all of us to do our part. If we traveled or otherwise saw loved ones over the holidays, we should quarantine and get tested. That way, we protect ourselves and those around us, and we reduce the level of coronavirus spread in our home communities.", "summary": "Despite warnings from public health officials, millions of Americans traveled over the Christmas holiday.

Right now, it's not business as usual.\"Our staff has been incredibly adept and flexible in accommodating increasing numbers of patients, so as you heard, we have five tents outside of the hospital,\" Batchlor said. \"We have patients in our conference room, in our chapel.\"Many gurneys are taken into the gift shop, she said.While Batchlor didn't specify how many new patients have Covid, the increase in their numbers is putting stress on all care.Batchlor said the hospital will not turn patients away but may have to employ techniques that have been used during war.\"We use what in the battlefield is called triage techniques, which is doing an assessment of each person's needs and prognosis and using scarce resources with patients that are most likely to benefit from them,\" she said.L.A. County Health Services Director Christina Ghaly said some hospitals are seeing patients who are still on ambulances.\"Those patients are being cared for and treated in the ambulance as if it's part of the emergency room bay,\" Ghaly said.L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said there have been 97,472 new cases over the past seven days. \"The sad reality is that all indicators show us that our situation may only get worse as we begin 2021,\" she said.More Americans were hospitalized this past week than any other week of the pandemic, according to the Covid Tracking Project. And the United States reported 121,235 current Covid-19 hospitalizations on Monday, a pandemic high.Six states set records Sunday for the most Covid-19 patients hospitalized: Alabama, California, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina. Texas hit an all-time high on Monday.Doctors say mass holiday gatherings will lead to even more patients -- a huge problem because many hospitals are already beyond capacity. \"It's really frustrating, because if you look at the data over the last 10 days, it actually started to show some signs of light,\" said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, professor of medicine at George Washington University.\"Places like the Midwest, with a drop in the number of cases. Even in the Northeast. US positivity rate dropped from about 12% down to about 10%. Those are really tangible signs of a slowing of the crisis. And now there almost certainly will be another spike.\"And unlike previous holidays, the Christmas-New Year combo stretches an entire week. \"We know that after every major holiday, that there was a spike in the number of cases,\" emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen said.\"We saw this after Memorial Day, after Fourth of July, after Labor Day. And those holidays were relatively short in comparison to Christmas and New Year's.\" On top of that, the weather is much colder now -- meaning more indoor gatherings and . ICUs are often associated with heart attacks and car accidents, but a growing number of ICU beds are occupied by Covid-19 patients.This past week, about 40% of all ICU patients in the US had Covid-19, according to a CNN analysis of data published Monday by the US Department of Health and Human Services.That's up from 16% in late September; 22% in late October; and 35% in late November. And more hospitalizations inevitably precede more deaths. The deaths of more than 63,000 Americans have been reported so far this month -- the most of any month since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. In just 11 months, more than 334,000 people have died from Covid-19. That means . And since most Americans can't get vaccinated until well into next year, the US faces a \"surge upon a surge\" following holiday travel, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health. As more countries detect the  first spotted in the UK, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new testing requirements for travelers arriving from the UK. The new rules go into effect Monday. Passengers must have had  within 72 hours of boarding a flight from the UK to the US, along with documentation of their lab results. Airlines will be required to confirm the test prior to the flight.So far, . All viruses mutate over time, and the novel coronavirus has mutated before. But scientists advising the UK government estimated this strain  at spreading than others.The companies behind the first two vaccines to gain emergency authorization in the US -- Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna -- are testing their vaccines to confirm whether they're effective against the new strain.Biotech company Novavax -- which announced the launch of a phase 3 trial of its Covid-19 vaccine in the US on Monday -- said it is also testing its vaccine against the UK strain.It will take weeks for the results, the company said.About 2.1 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the US, according to the CDC. More than 11.4 million doses have been distributed.Those numbers now include both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. And while there are lags in data reporting, doses by the end of the year.Asked about the apparent slow rollout of vaccines, Fauci said large, comprehensive vaccine programs with a new vaccine start slow before gaining momentum.\"I'm pretty confident that as we gain more and more momentum, as we transition from December to January and then February to March, I believe we will catch up with the projection,\" he said.Dr. Esther Choo, a professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, said vaccine distribution is \"just a very complicated thing.\"\"At every step, there's complexity and there's possibility for delay, whether it's individual state planning, allocation, training, supply of vaccine, storage ... there (are) just so many factors at this stage,\" Choo said.\"We need to be prepared for the fact that it is going to be a slow rollout in many places and that it will not change our behaviors or necessarily the trajectory of the pandemic in this country in the short term,\" Choo said.With vaccines likely not widely available until the summer, experts have urged Americans not to let their guard down.

{"text": "We teach kids not to do it. It's unsanitary. It's just plain gross to see. Let's be real, though. Most of us pick our noses — some  that seems to have ever been done on the subject, perhaps revealing how little even scientists want to think about it. Looking around the world, however, it's not exactly uncommon to see someone with a finger up their nose, either discreetly or not so much, . Jokes aside, nose picking is deadly serious. Not only are people spreading their own bacteria and viruses onto everything they touch after a bout of digging for gold — but you also \"transfer germs from your fingertips into the nose, which is the exact opposite of what you want,\" said infectious disease specialist Dr. Paul Pottinger, a professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. That means that you can spread coronavirus to others from your nose-picking session, and you are also more likely to bring that virus, along with others like influenza or rhinovirus (the common cold), directly into your body. The nose is one of three main ways that viruses can enter the body — the other two are the mouth and eyes. The nose has a number of defense systems to keep pathogens out, including hair at the front of the nostrils to block larger particles and the mucous membrane. That moist lining of the nose \"has microscopically small glands that can secrete mucus into the airway in response to foreign invaders. That includes big stuff like pollen and dirt and dust and also microscopic stuff, which would include bacteria and viruses,\" Pottinger said. Some mucus is a good and healthy thing, keeping most invaders out. But when it dries up, along with whatever it has caught, it turns into what most of us call boogers (scientists call them crusts). When you feel one in your nose, it's easy to want to pick it out without thinking.What many people don't realize is how delicate that skin inside the nose can be. Nose picking can create tiny cuts in the delicate epithelial linings in the nasal cavity, said molecular virologist Cedric Buckley, formerly an associate professor of biology at Jackson State University in Mississippi who now does STEM curriculum development.\"Once that barrier is breached, you're right into a capillary bed, which becomes the conduit for viral particle infection,\" explained Buckley, who also serves on the City of Jackson Covid-19 Task Force. This breach increases your chances of transmitting whatever germs are on your hands right into your bloodstream.Nose picking is something that should — more than ever during a pandemic — be avoided. But habits can be hard to break, especially those that you do without thinking. Picking the nose, like nail-biting, skin picking, lip chewing and hair pulling, is considered by mental health professionals to be a \"body-focused repetitive behavior.\" Those are \"actions that are directed at one's own body and that often focus on grooming or removing parts of the body,\" according to Dr. Elias Aboujaoude, clinical professor of psychiatry at Stanford University in California and director of the Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Clinic there. These behavioral habits can be a clinical disorder if they result in damage or significant impairment to someone's personal or professional life, Aboujaoude said via email. For many of us, though, they're just bad habits, not disorders. Habit reversal therapy, a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, is a tool that psychiatrists use to help people with body-focused repetitive behaviors. This treatment \"increases awareness of the behavior and its consequences, and trains the individual to replace nose picking with a 'competing response,'\" Aboujaoude said. That means doing something less damaging and more socially acceptable with one's hands, like making a fist and holding it, or squeezing a stress ball. This is where mask wearing can be especially useful. In addition to masks' effectiveness in reducing transmission of airborne particles that can contain coronavirus, they can also help reduce nose picking by physically blocking the habitual or unconscious finger-to-nose action. \"If they're eager to stop nose-picking, boy, what a great opportunity to take advantage of this moment in human history where everybody's supposed to be covering their face,\" Pottinger said. If you find your nose picking isn't a habit so much as a reaction to a constantly uncomfortable or clogged nose, get checked out by your doctor or at a local clinic. Your issue could have less to do with those nose crusts and more to do with another issue that needs to be addressed: \"You could have a deviated septum, you could have nasal inflammation, you could be prone to seasonal or chronic allergies, where your nasal membranes are constantly swollen,\" Buckley said.The best way to get rid of boogers is to blow your nose into a tissue and then wash your hands, instead of picking out the crusts. Neti pots or saline sprays are another option. \"Remember, the booger is just a dried out piece of mucus. If you rehydrate the mucus, you should be able to blow it out or have it come out on its own,\" Pottinger said. However, he said that everyone should get their own bottle — no sharing, not even with intimate partners. It should be kept clean, and the tip wiped off on a regular basis so germs don't get transferred into the nose from use to use. And if you use a neti pot, Pottinger said, be sure to use sterilized water. Humidifiers to keep indoor air hydrated can also help reduce crust formation. Caring for your nasal health, which definitely includes not picking your nose, will reduce the risk of catching coronavirus — and passing it along. In working with patients who have caught it, Pottinger said that a sometimes long-lasting side effect of the viral infection is anosmia, or , which impacts the ability to taste as well. For patients who experience this condition, \"they're very, very depressed, discouraged and disheartened that they can no longer taste their food. Now I'm hopeful that some of those people will get back their sense of smell, some do. For some, it is a ,\" he said via email. \"If you like to eat food, and you'd like to taste good things, then please make sure that you do prevent yourself from catching COVID-19.\"  An earlier version of this story misspelled Dr. Elias Aboujaoude's last name.", "summary": "Most of us pick our noses.

{"text": "When China first reported cases of coronavirus to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019, it was described as a . It didn't even have a name., Chinese scientists had identified the virus' genome sequence, the genetic code that makes up the virus. Within three weeks, the first test kits  and then shared by the WHO. And just over 11 months since the virus was reported to the WHO, the first people were vaccinated, making the shots the fastest vaccines ever developed.The speed at which we've learned about coronavirus is unprecedented and scientists say we already know a remarkable amount. But one year on, with more than 81 million reported infections and 1.7 million deathsaround the world, there's still a lot we don't know about Covid-19. Those unknowns range from the basics -- such as how the virus started -- to the more complicated questions, including how will this pandemic end?\"We have learned a tremendous amount, but in terms of understanding anything in any real detail, we've got miles and miles to go,\" said Maureen Ferran, an associate professor of biology at Rochester Institute of Technology. \"This is going to keep virologists and public health officials busy for decades.\"As governments raced to find a vaccine for the virus, one of the most basic questions fell off the public's radar: what is the origin of the virus? The virus' origin has been dogged by confusion and conspiracy theories. Initially, the virus looked like it was connected to a Wuhan market that sold live animals, but a Lancet study published in January found that  of the initial patients had no direct connection to that market.Some, including US President Donald Trump, questioned whether the virus had been released after being studied or created in a Wuhan lab.  there is overwhelming evidence that the virus originated in the wild, and say the closest known relatives to coronavirus are too genetically different from Covid-19 for it to have been leaked and subsequentlycaused the outbreak. Studies have that the virus may have been circulating in United States and Europe in December 2019, months earlier than first thought. Chinese state media  that the virus may haveoriginated outside of China. But while Peter Collignon, a professor of microbiology at the Australian National University, says it's quite likely that the virus was circulating in the US and parts of Europe before the first cases in those countrieswere diagnosed, there's nothing conclusive to show that the virus originated outside of China. The World Health Organization, which is investigating the origin of the virus, will look into whether Covid-19 could have been circulating in China before the first cases were identified in December.Despite the plethora of conspiracy theories, there are a few things that most scientists agree on. Covid-19 is a coronavirus, a type of virus that is responsible for everything from the common cold, to SARS. It's zoonotic, meaning it originally came from an animal. Some studies point to bats as the likely vectors, which are known to carry coronaviruses. And most scientists still think the virus transferred to humans in China, as that is where the first cases were identified. But we still don't know where the virus first passed to humans, and if it transferred through another animal intermediary, such as a pangolin or a civet cat, before infecting humans. Those are questions we may never answer, says Ferran -- after all, in the more than 40 years since Ebola was discovered, scientists  to definitively say which animal it came from.When Covid-19 was first identified, it was seen as a respiratory illness. But as the months have gone on, a range of symptoms and complications of the disease have become apparent.Many people lose their sense of smell. Some people vomit or have diarrhea, or get discoloration on their . Some even have impaired cognition or brain damage. We now know that even those who recover from Covid-19 can experience long lasting effects, including anxiety, brain damage and chronic fatigue. A  in the British Medical Journal in August found that around 10% of patients had a prolonged illness from Covid-19 lasting more than 12 weeks.  But scientists  these effects from Covid-19 last -- and they can't really explain why it is that some people suffer more than others. A letter published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine in November described a case where two 60-year-old identical twin brothers were both infected with Covid-19 had very different outcomes. One twin was released from hospital after two weeks without any complications, the other was transferred to intensive care and required a ventilator.The case demonstrated what researchers have been observing for months: there seems to almost be a randomness in how severely coronavirus affects different people -- although there are some people who do have a  due to existing chronic conditions or old age, among other factors.\"We all have slightly different genetics,\" Collignon said. \"Often for reasons we don't fully understand, some people cope with infections better than others.\"That's also true across demographics. For months, scientists have observed trends showing older people and men tend to be more vulnerable. Scientists know something about why children tend to have less serious infections from coronavirus -- they have , and these receptors are how coronavirus gets into our cells. But they can't really explain why older people have such a high death rate from coronavirus -- much higher than from the common flu. \"What is it about age that makes you so much more susceptible to having disease?\" Collignon questioned. \"We've got the data and we know it's true ... but I don't think we've got all the answers for that.\" Back in January, China confirmed that the virus could spread from . But a full year on, there's still debate over exactly how that happens. Scientists say the key way the virus is spreading is though droplets which are sent into the air when someone coughs or sneezes. These droplets fall to the ground after one or two meters, and masks can help prevent their spread.But some scientists argue that the virus is also being spread by aerosols -- much smaller particles that can stay suspended in the air for hours and travel long distances. That would be a problem, says Collignon -- cloth masks can't protect against aerosol transmission.Collignon says that while aerosol transmission could be happening, it seems that most infections are caused by droplets. Instead, he thinks much more focus needs to be placed on the effect of air flow indoors -- a recent  found virus droplets could still infect people more than two meters away due to air flow from an air conditioning unit. There are other questions, too. According to Ferran, it's unclear what dose of coronavirus is needed for someone to get infected. Children may be more likely to be asymptomatic, but there are still no definitive answers on how much children are involved in spreading the virus.  All of these questions are important as they have implications for what policy approaches governments take. If children are involved in spreading the virus, then it makes sense to shut schools -- and conversely, if they aren't involved in spreading the virus, then shutting schools could be having a large impact with limited pay off.In August,  from the University of Hong Kong said a 33-year-old man had been reinfected with Covid-19 -- 4.5 months after he was first infected. That seemed to confirm what some people were afraid of -- that it was possible to get infected twice.The good news, according to Collignon, is that while some people can get infected twice, \"it's such a rare event that you get put in a medical journal.\" Around 99% of people infected with the virus don't seem to get infected again for at least six months after they are infected, Collignon said. The big question, then, is how long does natural immunity from the virus last?Scientists can't answer that yet as the virus hasn't been with us for long enough. The same is true for the vaccine -- we don't know how long the immunity for that lasts either. Scientists assumed that the vaccine would provide some form of immunity for a number of years, said Collignon. \"But the bottom line is, we don't know yet.\"At the moment, the coronavirus vaccines look like they are more effective than the influenza vaccine, which needs to be administered every year. Scientists are optimistic about the vaccine and think the chance of long-term side effects is unlikely. As Jonathan Stoye, from the Francis Crick Institute in London, puts it: \"I think the risk is much greater from the virus than the vaccine.\"But that doesn't mean there aren't still questions about the vaccine beyond how long immunity lasts. We don't know whether the virus will mutate,in a way that will render a vaccine ineffective. The longer we take to vaccinate large swaths of the population, the more opportunity it has to mutate, said Ferran. And some of the new vaccines employ mRNA technology, which has never been used widely before -- raising questions about whether the immunity from those vaccines will last for the same length of time as traditional vaccines. All of these questions have implications for the big question: when will this all end?Many around the world are pinning their hopes on the vaccine, but even that isn't a quick fix. It will likely take years to vaccinate the majority of the world's population -- something that would be necessary to stop the spread -- and polls show that some people may not be willing to be vaccinated. Even if people do, the vaccine isn't a silver bullet. \"I think the vaccines are the way to go. But people seem to have a view of it will give me 100% protection -- no vaccine does that,\" Collignon. And even if someone is vaccinated, scientists don't yet know whether it's possible that they could get the virus and spread it, even if they don't get sick themselves. It's likely that even once there is widespread vaccination, we might still have to live with the virus. After all, only one virus in human history has been declared eradicatedby a vaccine -- small pox. There are other issues that could influence how long coronavirus is with us, such as whether the virus mutates or develops a new strain. It's possible that the virus could become less deadly or infectious -- but it's also possible that the virus could become more virulent. That possibility has been highlighted by the UK's recently announcement that it has identified a new strain of coronavirus that appears to be 70% more infectious than the old strain. In the meantime, we are going to need to rely on a range of other measures. Stoye, from the Francis Crick Institute, said that would likely mean taking a range of different protections in combination. \"You can't say -- we will do this one thing, and you'll prevent the virus spreading.\"And that's where all the questions about how the virus spreads and how different people are affected comes in. Those are important not just for dealing with the current outbreak -- but for future outbreaks. The problem, says Collignon, is that not enough money is spent on answering the basics. \"We spend billions of dollars on vaccines and drugs, but you can't get funding to do research on basics like how effective is this mask versus that mask,\" he said, adding that was partly because answers to those questions didn't make the problem go away -- they just decreased the risk.Stoye said he was concerned that we still hadn't found the right way to deal with the pandemic. \"That's what worries me about when we talk about future epidemics -- will we have learned from this one enough to prevent another one?\" ", "summary": "There's still a lot we don't know about Covid-19, ranging from the basics -- such as how the virus started -- to the more complicated questions, including how will this pandemic end?"},
{"text": "Lives lost, families torn apart, economies ruined -- these tragedies arejust some of the devastation caused by the deadly novel coronavirus as it swept the globe in 2020. The pandemic brought the world's scientists together in an unprecedented race to develop vaccines. Meeting that goal in under a year is \"truly historic,\" according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Covid-19 was not, however, the only battle waged by doctors and researchers over the last year. The fight against many other diseases and conditions that plague humanity continued this year despite challenging circumstances.Here are some of the top non-pandemicadvances in health care during 2020 that you may not have heard much about -- many of them nominated by major health organizations.In June, a vaccine years in the making finally brought an end to the , which killed over 2,200 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Another outbreak killed over 11,000 West Africans between 2014 and 2016.Transmitted by exposure to bodily fluids, often when relatives were bathing the dead body for burial, Ebola is highly contagious and deadly -- .The World Health Organization called the use of the vaccine by the DRC and other African countries a \"milestone\" in the fight against Ebola.The fight against dementia and Alzheimer's --  -- continued during 2020, with some good news. \"Advances in biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease have perhaps been the biggest story this year,\" said Joe Balintfy, a spokesperson for the National Institute on Aging. Blood-based tests are being developed to detect beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, two of the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's disease. Up until recently, the only way to test for Alzheimer's was to do a spinal tap or use an expensive brain scan that required injecting a radioactive tracer and is only performed at specialized centers.The US Food and Drug Administration in Mayapproved flortaucipir, or AV-1451, as the first drug used to image the presence of tau tangles. And  that can be used in clinic by physicians to measure amyloid proteins Aβ42 and Aβ40 became available in most US states in October.Advances in behavioral and lifestyle interventions for dementia continued in 2020. The National Institute on Aging has over  in progress exploring the role of diet, exercise and sleep. The Alzheimer's Association reported on studies ofsupplements -- such as a lab-made version of vitamin B1, and a drink that boosts  -- and their effectiveness at slowing early cognitive decline. The American Heart Association nominated a \"game-changing\" development in the fight against heart and kidney disease associated with diabetes as a top health advance for 2020. Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation. In addition to managing blood sugars, the two newer classes of medications used to treat Type 2 diabetes -- SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs -- can \"safely and significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and death,\" . The drugs were also shown to \"reduce hospitalization and slow the progression of chronic to end-stage kidney disease including the risks of dialysis, transplantation or death,\" the AHA said.A  showed promise for the investigational drug vericiguat in helping people with worsening heart failure and reducedejection fraction, a measure of how much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction.About 6.2 million adults in the US have heart failure, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\"This is an important treatment breakthrough for a group of patients with limited options and who are growing in number,\" said Nicole Napoli, the director of media relations for the American College of Cardiology.TheFDA in January approved the first treatment for thyroid eye disease, in which the eyes push forward and bulge outward, causing eye pain, double vision, light sensitivity or difficulty closing the eye.The Endocrine Society said its members were \"thrilled to finally have a treatment\" for the rare but debilitating disorder.Moms and Dads, listen up: If you missed this story, you'll want to get the full treatment. The FDA approved a drug for head lice in adults and children older than 6 months. The drug, abametapir, or XEGLYZE, is applied as a lotion to dry hair and rinsed with warm water in about 10 minutes.The lotion was shown in clinical trials to be about 80% effective in ridding the hair of lice compared to 50% from a placebo. XEGLYZE is a welcome addition to the lice-treatment arsenal as many lice have become resistant to existing treatments.Between 6 million and 12 million cases of head lice occur in children 3 to 11 years of age in the US, .The FDA in November recognized sesame seeds as a common allergen, calling upon manufacturers to voluntarily add a warning to products that contain the seeds.Over a million people in the United States have an allergy to sesame, and it is \"among the 10 most common childhood food allergies,\" . Reactions can be severe, the NIH warns.Food allergy consumer advocates have been petitioning Congress and the FDA to mandate the warning on labels, instead of leaving it up to the companies, so expect to hear more about this issue in 2021.Despite these advances, a number of important public health issues fell out of the spotlight during 2020.International progress toward bringing the HIV epidemic under control was blown \"completely off track\" by the novel coronavirus, . In the US, for example, spring 2020 saw a 75% drop in people starting PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, the medicine designed to prevent people at risk for HIV from getting the disease from sex or needles using for drugs.Fear of the novel coronavirus -- and a wish not to overwhelm doctors and hospitals deluged with Covid-19 patients -- kept many people from seeking basic health care.

A new CDC report found the US had the largest number of fatal drug overdoses ever recorded during the 12-month period that ended in June.The CDC said most deaths occurred when access to care was limited or closed during lockdowns to control the coronavirus pandemic.The Clean Air Act celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, but the celebration was marred by wildfires that endangered lung health and the loss of a number of environmental safeguards.  \"The Trump administration has attempted to roll back more than 100 public health and environmental safeguards, many of which protected our communities from dangerous air pollution,\" said Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer of the American Lung Association, via email.\"This has included repealing the first-ever limit on carbon pollution from existing power plants, undermining cleaner cars standards and the authority of states to address tailpipe pollution and attempting to undermine protections from toxic mercury pollution,\" he said.The association's 2020 \"State of the Air\" report found \"nearly half of Americans live in areas with unhealthy air quality,\" which is made worse by climate change.Use of e-cigarettes is still a health concern, especially among young people, yet the topic has \"basically fallen off the radar since Covid-19\" arrived, said the American College of Cardiology's Napoli. That's disturbing, since a found young people who have vaped are up to five times more likely to test positive for Covid-19, said the ALA's Rizzo.The  found nearly 2 million youth stopped vaping, but that still left 3.6 million teens using e-cigarettes -- including one in five high school students and one in 20 middle school students.\"Many vape every day or nearly daily, underscoring the highly addictive nature of nicotine, which is harmful to developing brains,\" Rizzo said.While people of color and marginalized communities have long failed to receive equal access to quality health care and treatment, the deadly impact of those inequities was never starker than during the pandemic. Studies showed that racial and ethnic minority groups were more likely to have severe cases of Covid-19 and were more likely to need to be admitted to intensive care units, put on ventilators or die, .Americans live in a country where \"access to health care depends on where you live and work,\" Dr. Richard E. Besser, former acting CDC director and president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, .\"This sad truth is not new, but it has been put on display during a pandemic that has served as both an illustration and an accelerant of the unequal opportunities and systemic barriers that leave Black, Hispanic and Native Americans exposed and disproportionately vulnerable.\"", "summary": "The devastation of the novel coronavirus overshadowed many key health breakthroughs this year.

But experts continue to warn that while the end is in sight, the pandemic is not over and  holiday could be on its way. \"We very well might see a post-seasonal -- in the sense of Christmas, New Years -- surge,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday morning, pointing to holiday travel and private gatherings taking place despite the advice of health experts. The nation's top infectious disease expert described the potential rise in cases as a \"surge upon a surge,\" telling CNN's Dana Bash, \"If you look at the slope, the incline of cases that we've experienced as we've gone into the late fall and soon to be early winter, it is really quite troubling.\" More than 1.1 million people were, marking the third busiest day for US air travel since March. More than 616,000 were screened on Christmas Day alone, and hundreds of thousands more traveled in the days leading up to the holiday. Covid-19 hospitalization numbers across the US are already at record levels. On Sunday, the country recorded its fourth-highest number of hospitalizations with more than 118,720 Covid-19 patients nationwide, according to the This is the 26th consecutive day that the US has remained above 100,000 current hospitalizations.All of the five highest days for hospitalizations have been in the last week.Another surge of cases and hospitalizations will, inevitably, mean more deaths -- on top of an already devastating death toll. \"When you're dealing with a baseline of 200,000 new cases a day and about 2,000 deaths per day, with the hospitalizations over 120,000, we are really at a very critical point,\" Fauci said. \"As we get into the next few weeks,\" he added, \"it might actually get worse.\"Fauci's comments Sunday came as the US surpassed 19.1 million coronavirus cases, yet another milestone for the pandemic, coming just over 11 months after the first case was recorded in the US in late January.As of 8 p.m. ET Sunday, Johns Hopkins University has reported 125,041 new cases and 1,160 reported deaths. More than 333,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US.Another193,000 could lose their lives over the next two months, according to from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\"The projections are just nightmarish,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease specialist at the Baylor College of Medicine. \"People can still save the lives of their loved ones by practicing that social distancing and masks. And remember, vaccines are around the corner.\"Nearly 2 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than 9.5 million doses have been distributed. Those numbers now include both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. And while there are lags in data reporting,  people by the end of the year.Asked about the apparent slow rollout of vaccines, Fauci told CNN Sunday that large, comprehensive vaccine programs with a new vaccine start slow before gaining momentum. \"I'm pretty confident that as we gain more and more momentum, as we transition from December to January and then February to March, I believe we will catch up with the projection,\" he said. Dr. Esther Choo, a professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, explained that vaccine distribution is \"just a very complicated thing.\" \"At every step, there's complexity and there's possibility for delay, whether it's individual state planning, allocation, training, supply of vaccine, storage... there (are) just so many factors at this stage,\" Choo said. \"We need to be prepared for the fact that it is going to be a slow rollout in many places and that it will not change our behaviors or necessarily the trajectory of the pandemic in this country in the short term,\" Choo said. A number of experts have warned Americans not to let their guard down as vaccinations begin and to continue wearing masks, social distancing, avoiding crowds and gatherings, and regularly washing their hands. It likely won't be until summer that vaccines are widely available and begin to make a meaningful impact on the pandemic's course, officials have said. Fauci estimates about 70% to 85% of the population needs to get vaccinated against Covid-19 for the country to achieve herd immunity.The new testing requirements for travelers arriving from the UK, which will go into effect Monday.

{"text": "I received my first rosary when my second grade class at a Catholic school in Baltimore received the sacrament of the first Holy Communion. The boys were given black rosaries and a prayer book, the girls the same, but their rosaries were white. That was back in 1965.My family was Catholic but we did not pray the rosary. I put the beads in a drawer, far more excited about the World Book Encyclopedia set I was given that same day. Never used, the rosary disappeared somewhere along the way.It wasn't until 1994 when I acquired a second string of beads honoring Mary, the mother of Jesus,as I walked the frozen streets of East Baltimore with Sister Maria D. Jackson of the Mission Helpers of the Sacred Heart.Sister Maria of the Way of the Cross, as she was known within the Mission Helpers order, was delivering Holy Eucharist to shut-ins in my neighborhood the day after an ice storm. We'd never met before I called the convent volunteering to help with whatever might need doing. The day I called was the day Sister Maria was visiting the housebound faithful. On that cold January morning, I was trying to remove some guilt about a marriage I'd wrecked a few years earlier. Somewhere in the midst of my sadness, which I shared candidly, this kind and no-nonsense nun took a rosary from her black skirts, handed it to me and said, \"Try this.\" She died in 2012 but her influence lives on. Since that frozen day, I have prayed the rosary -- using many strings of beads as they often break or get lost -- several times a week and, in the past few years, nearly daily. The discipline -- a slow, methodical meditation -- brings me comfort, peace and insights that would otherwise be beyond me.I long ago lost the rosary Sister Maria gave to me, and though I'd love to have it again, it's not about the specific beads. The loss doesn't keep me from entering the mystical realm of prayer.Nearly every major religion in the world -- including Buddhism, Shintoism and Sikhism -- uses beads in prayer and meditation. Islam uses prayer beads called \"misbaha,\" sometimes called \"the Muslim rosary.\" Hinduism calls its beads \"mala,\" or garland.The exception is Judaism, which frowns upon the practice. It is said that the practice veers too close to idol worship -- and thus paganism, although several of my Orthodox rabbi friends said they were not aware of any written prohibition, only long-held custom.Christian hermits and monks used pebbles to keep track of one's prayers in the third century, according to the Catholic Encyclopedia. Some 200 years later, Pope Gregory the Great popularized prayers to Mary using beads. Widespread devotion of the practice is attributed to Saint Dominic, the 12th-century Spaniard who founded the Dominican order.There is nothing magical about a string of beads, whether they are pearls, wood or plastic. A rosary is a tool, akin to a screwdriver or wrench, nothing until put in practice.Feeling the smooth beads pass through my fingers as repetitions of \"Hail, Mary\" and \"Our Father\" fall from my lips helps focus my roving mind. And while prayer is among the trickier subjects of , it has been shown to lower blood pressure, ease stress and otherwise give a feeling of well-being. No guarantees, of course.My experience has been that praying the rosary is like a key to an invisible door. I don't know when the portal will arrive as I sit at the window next to the sink where my Italian grandmother washed dishes for 40 years. It doesn't every time. But when some sort of opening does occur, thoughts come through it that ordinarily may not have.I dedicate a bead to a deceased friend or relative that had not been on my mind for a while, or jot down a reminder to call someone going through a rough time. Sometimes I'm reminded to make a modest donation to a charity, religious or not. The practice takes about 20 minutes each morning and I always feel better when finished than when I had started.I had not yet met Sister Maria and did not know the power of prayer nor the science that seems to support it when I traveled to Lourdes, France, in 1990. Traveling with my 9-year-old daughter Amelia, the visit was a stop on the way to my namesake grandfather's village on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees.Lourdes has been heralded as the site of miracles since the mid-19th century when believers hold that the Virgin Mary appeared more than a dozen times to a local, 14-year-old shepherd girl named Bernadette Soubirous.Soubirous died of tuberculosis at age 35 while praying the rosary and, like many Catholics, was buried with a rosary entwined in her hands. Asked one day about the apparitions, she is said by biographers to have replied, \"The Virgin used me as a broom to remove the dust. When the work is done, the broom is put behind the door again.\"By the summer of 1990, I was in dire need of a new broom, one with stiff bristles.For more than half my life, I'd been drinking, smoking marijuana and taking pretty much whatever non-injected escape came along. I was 32 years old, newly divorced from the mother of my three children and lost. With no idea what to do about it.I had just enough sense in Europe not to look for drugs in the company of my daughter. But I had no problem sending her to the club car on trains from Paris to Galicia to get her dad a beer. And then another, sometimes with a miniature of anisette.Between the City of Light and my grandfather's village outside of Vigo, there was Lourdes, to which an estimated 200 million people have visited since word of Soubirous' vision spread. Many go in search of healing for illnesses both crippling and fatal.I went as a tourist, just a stop at a dot on the map for a peek at something I'd heard about all my life. At the freshwater spring there, which locals say began bubbling after Bernadette was told to scratch the dirt during one of the apparitions, I filled a small plastic bottle with the water to bring back to my Polish grandmother. I don't remember if I prayed at Lourdes or not. Less than 24 hours after returning to Baltimore, I was sharing my sorrows with a poet friend who did not drink. I didn't know her very well but wanted to know her better. In the middle of our conversation, she looked at me and said, without any drama, \"You're an alcoholic.\"I put down the half-full beer I was drinking and haven't had a drink or an unprescribed drug since. She steered me to church basements where people drink coffee and eat cookies while telling the truth about themselves.I met Sister Maria four years later and began to protect the gift of sobriety by praying the rosary.In late March 2003, after the United States invaded Iraq, I read a story in The New York Times that quoted an American battlefield chaplain saying that he was almost out of a 90-day supply of religious items. At the time, the US campaign was less than two days old.\"We've been going through our rosaries and Bibles,\" Maj. Gen. Douglas L. Carver, a Southern Baptist, said at the time. \"It's a sobering moment.\"The chaplain's words stirred me to begin work on a documentary about the rosary, a film still in production in which beads and the personal stories attached to them are donated and then given away to anyone who asks.One of the many people interviewed -- just about all of them ordinary folks -- is 89-year-old Rosary Ricigliano, a lifelong Catholic from Brooklyn, New York, living with family in Naples, Florida.\"I've spent my whole life telling people that Rosary is my real name,\" said Ricigliano, who prays the beads each morning and over the years has collected and given away many strays.\"If I'm in a thrift store and there's a rosary for a quarter, I buy it even though I already have dozens of them,\" she said. \"I hate to see one just hanging from a nail on the wall.\"What is missing from the tools that hang on pegs above a workbench, above a windowsill set with candles and icons? The hands to hold them and a job that needs to be done.

{"text": "With Christmas in the rear view mirror, public health experts are bracing for yet another surge in  cases, similar to those seen after other US holidays in recent months.\"We've just seen these amplification events, and that's what's happened at the end of this year in the US,\" said Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.\"We had, we had , we had Halloween, and each one of these events brought lots of people together and just gave the virus more fuel to move through the population,\" Bromage said. \"Christmas is going to do a similar thing.\" Despite  to postpone travel and stay home, more than 7.1 million people were screened at TSA checkpoints over the last week, according to the agency's numbers.  Nearly 1.2 million people were screened at airports on Wednesday alone, an air travel record for the pandemic. While the number of travelers screened on Christmas Day -- 616,469 people -- represents just 23% of the total screened on the same day a year ago, the figure remains worrying for officials because it doesn't signal the end of the holiday travel rush, but a lull before travelers begin to return home.For weeks,  this holiday season, and that guidance extends to New Year's Eve, with the CDC urging revelers to celebrate at home or virtually. If they host an in-person celebration, the agency suggests staying outside, limiting the numbers of guests, making extra masks available and keeping background music low to avoid shouting. Dr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean of Emory University's School of Medicine, said if people get together they should keep gatherings below 10 people and get tested at least once, maybe twice. \"Your level of protection is as strong as your weakest link, and if there's a weak link, then the virus is going to spread,\" he told CNN. \"We've learned how quickly this virus and how easily this virus spreads, so we have to take all the precautions possible.\" The fears of a holiday surge come as the US met  for the pandemic: On Saturday afternoon, the US death toll surpassed 330,747, according to data from Johns Hopkins University -- meaning 1 in 1,000 Americans have died of Covid-19.And December is now the deadliest month since the pandemic began. At least 63,575 deaths from Covid-19 have been totaled so far this month, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. April held the previous record of 60,738 deaths.On Saturday, Johns Hopkins reported 186,164 new cases and 1,494 deaths. There are also 117,334 current Covid-19 hospitalizations, the fifth highest daily number of hospitalizations reported since the pandemic began, according to the Covid Tracking Project.At least 9,547,925 vaccine doses have been distributed and at least 1,944,585 doses of the vaccine have been administered, according to the CDC.Officials fear the surge even as the US plans to, following the emergence of a new coronavirus variant that is potentially more transmissible and said to have originated in the UK.The CDC announced Thursday passengers will need a negative PCR or antigen test within 72 hours of boarding a flight from the UK to the US, along with documentation of their laboratory results. Airlines will be required to confirm the test prior to the flight.The order goes into effect Monday. Two cases of the new variant have been found in Ontario, Canada, according to a  from the Ontario government issued Saturday. Ontario is the first province in Canada to detect cases of the variant.A couple from Durham with no known travel history, exposure or high-risk contacts tested positive for the new variant, according to the release.

Testing on the day of departure may reduce that risk by 37 to 61%, per the paper, which has not been peer-reviewed. Dr. del Rio was skeptical that the testing requirement would be effective, telling CNN Saturday he believed it would be better to also require a rapid antigen test at the time of boarding, and perhaps at the time of landing in the US.\"One test in my mind is not enough,\" he said. \"I think you need to do two tests at least.\"The CDC said earlier this week that the variant has not been identified through sequencing efforts in the US, but that could be because the US surveillance system established for Covid-19 hasn't caught it yet.It's \"highly possible\" the new variant is already in the US, del Rio said, given how quickly the virus spreads.\"I want to stress to the public that rather than getting terribly concerned about this new strain, I think we need to just reinforce the restrictions we've been talking about,\" he said, pointing to mask wearing and social distancing.

{"text": "Of the more than 3,000 species of mosquitoes in the world, just a small number have evolved to specialize in sucking human blood. How human-biting mosquitoes track us down so effectively isn't currently known, but it matters, since they don't just make us itch. They also carry dangerous diseases such as Zika, dengue, West Nile virus and malaria that can be deadly. In fact, stopping these pesky insects in their tracks could save up to half a million lives lost to those diseases each year.  \"In each of those cases where a mosquito has evolved to bite humans — which has only happened two or three times — they become nasty disease vectors,\" said Carolyn \"Lindy\" McBride, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute in New Jersey.  That's why she wants to understand how they find and target humans.\"Mosquitoes mostly choose what to bite based on odor,\" said McBride, whose lab focuses on the Aedes aegypti mosquito species that evolved to bite humans specifically. Only female mosquitoes suck blood since they need it to produce their eggs. Knowing how a potentially disease-carrying female mosquito sniffs out a person, while ignoring other warm-blooded animals, is a key query.Once that's better known, much more effective repellents — or bait to lure mosquitoes away from humans — could be made, saving lives, said Christopher Potter, associate professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University's Center for Sensory Biology.If scientists can control their sense of smell, \"we can really control what these mosquitoes are doing,\" said Potter, who studies another human-specific mosquito, Anopheles, which carries malaria. It's not an easy question to answer, since any animal smell is made up of hundreds of chemical compounds mixed together in specific ratios. \"The actual chemicals that are found in human odor are basically the same as the chemicals found in animal odor — it's the ratios and the relative abundance of those compounds in human mixtures that's unique,\" said McBride, whose  focuses on those issues. Each time a hungry female mosquito flies by, it's doing complex chemical math in its tiny brain, figuring out what's a human, what's dog and what's a flower. \"To investigate, we decided to record neural activity in the brain of females while exposing them to natural human and animal odor extracts,\" wrote Zhilei Zhao, a graduate student in McBride's lab, in a Twitter thread describing . It took four years to develop \"the necessary genetic reagents, odor delivery systems, and analytical approaches,\" Zhao wrote. McBride's lab team created a library of the chemical composition of animal odors. \"That data set doesn't really exist — so we decided to go out and collect it ourselves,\" said Jessica Zung, a graduate student in McBride's lab. Zung has collected scent samples from about 40 different animals so far, including guinea pigs, rats, quail and more. Comparing some of those to the 16 human samples, something jumped out. Decanal, a simple, common compound, is particularly abundant in human skin, Zung said. Ubiquitous in the natural world, in humans, decanal comes from another, more complex compound. Zung dug into the archives to find  (much of it originally done to find an acne cure) that detailed how when one component of our skin's natural oils, sapienic acid, breaks down, decanal is left over. This acid (as indicated by its name) is only found in human beings.  It's what likely leads to the high levels of decanal that help the mosquitoes smell their way to us, but more studies need to be done.Understanding what the mosquitoes are sniffing out is only part of the story; knowing how they do it is also important. To see exactly how mosquitoes use this sense, scientists bred genetically modified Aedes aegypti mosquitoes \"so that we could cut open their little tiny heads and put them under a fancy microscope and actually watch neurons firing when they're exposed to human and animal odors,\" McBride said.The research team already knew that mosquitoes have about 60 different types of neurons that sense odors, so when they looked in the insects' brains, they thought they might see a lot of activity. But it was surprisingly quiet, meaning that the signal was perhaps quite simple, down to just a couple types of neurons.\"One type of neuron responded really strongly to both humans and animals. Another type of neuron responded to both — but it responded much more strongly to humans than animals,\" McBride said of . So it may be as simple as that mosquito's brain comparing just two  types of neurons. This kind of research has only been possible since the technology to study mosquito brains in detail became available, which only happened recently. \"It's been traditionally very hard to study this at the level we're doing it now,\" Potter said. Incredibly, mosquitoes that target humans have evolved to be able to do this in just the last 5,000 years, so it's a \"really amazing example of rapid evolution,\" McBride said.The Aedes aegypti, aka \"yellow fever mosquito\" also carries dengue, Zika and chikungunya. The critter originated in Africa and likely made its way to its current range in the southern United States and Central and South America on slave ships during the 1600s, according to McBride. These diseases combined kill and sicken thousands of people a year, which is why mosquitoes have been called \"the world's deadliest animal\" by the . McBride and Potter both hope their work could be used by others working on repellents and attractants to prevent disease. As far as insider knowledge on how to keep from being bitten in your own backyard, McBride said she uses a fan. \"Have it blow air over where you're sitting outside or over the barbecue or under the table where they're biting your feet.\" It's not that you're blowing the scent around to knock the mosquitoes off track, she said. It's simply because these deadly creatures, McBride said, \"are not great fliers.\" ", "summary": "How human-biting mosquitoes track us isn't known, but it matters, since they carry diseases such as Zika, dengue, West Nile virus and malaria.

So my clients ask me this question all the time: If I feel sick, should I exercise or rest? The immediate answer is complicated, but with an assessment of your symptoms, you'll have the confidence to decide more quickly. And, if the answer is to skip your workout, there is still an exercise or two that you can do to help you feel less sick. With cooler winter temperatures in full force, cold and flu season is here. On average, Americans have two or three colds every year, according to the . This may wipe you out for seven to 10 days per cold. If you add in other symptoms, like an upset stomach, a fever or a cough, you may be looking at even more downtime. Here are the five most common scenarios if you've fallen ill -- and how you can decide if you should exercise or take it easy. If your symptoms include common ones like a runny nose and congestion, just scale back your workout to make it less intense. Working out with a cold may actually help relieve nasal congestion and open up your nasal passageways. Instead of doing a high-intensity workout, try doing a lower-impact strength-training workout. Or instead of going for a run or jog, go for a brisk walk. Simply pare down your workout so that it's less intense and takes less time than usual.  Working out while you have a temperature can actually increase dehydration and raise your internal body temperature even more. Also, with a fever your muscles are already more fatigued and have less strength, so it's best to give them a rest.Instead, try doing a yoga pose called Savasana with lots of props. Lie down on the ground. Place a bolster or pillows underneath your knees, and a pillow underneath your head. Relax your arms by your sides with the palms face up.

Make sure to drink plenty of water to soothe your throat both before, during and after exercise. Slow down your pace (like you would if you had a cold).If your sore throat is accompanied by a fever or body aches, however, take a break. Get back in the groove. Especially if this cough is coming from your chest and accompanied by mucus, definitely skip your workout. Frequently coughing can prevent you from being able to catch your breath properly during a workout and make it difficult to take a deep breath when your heart rate increases during exercise. Instead, engage in a forward-fold stretch to improve circulation and relieve coughing symptoms. It's a stress-relieving exercise that invigorates your nervous system and literally turns your head upside down. Your head goes below your heart, which calms your mind and reduces stress -- both mentally and in your physical body.  If you are vomiting or have diarrhea, your body becomes dehydrated. Exercising will only add to this dehydration. Additionally, if you're nauseous, moving around may cause you to become more nauseous or even vomit. Instead, try a yoga pose called Child's Pose. Come onto a yoga mat on your knees and open them as wide as your hips. Then sit your glutes back over your heels and reach your arms forward. Rest your head on the mat or on a pillow. Breathe into your stomach and your back, and slowly release your breath. Inhale and exhale through your nose and think about soothing your stomach.You are your own best advocate.

{"text": "Smell loss -- called anosmia -- is a . For the past nine months, the two of us -- a  and an  -- have applied our respective expertise to develop smell-based screening and testing programs as part of a response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.In early October, one of our graduate students shared the story of her mom and her daily coffee routine. It illustrates perfectly how smell checks could be used as a screening tool for Covid-19 infection. One afternoon, our graduate student's mom went to make her habitual cup of coffee only to discover she could not smell or taste it. She'd heard from her daughter about Covid-associated anosmia, so she next tried smelling some pine-scented cleaning spray and couldn't smell that either.Given her sudden and unexplained anosmia, our student's mom quarantined herself and got a Covid-19 test, which came back positive. By taking her smell loss seriously, getting a rapid test and self-isolating, she created a dead end for the virus, breaking the transmission chain before the virus could spread to anyone else.By some estimates, . But many are unaware they have lost their sense of smell until they actively try to smell something that should have an odor, . This is why we are encouraging people to actively try to smell something each day. Sudden unexplained anosmia is a specific symptom of Covid-19. It can be used as a daily DIY screening tool by individuals, providing another tool in the fight to contain Covid-19.Covid-19 affects your sense of smell in a different way than a common cold does. When your nose is stuffy, odorants -- the lightweight odor active molecules found in the air -- are physically unable to reach the smell receptors at the top of your nasal cavity.With Covid-19, loss of smell is instead caused by a signaling disruption. Research has shown that the virus attacks cells behind the bridge of the nose immediately next to olfactory neurons. These supporting cells are  that the virus exploits to enter cells, so they are especially vulnerable. This tissue becomes inflamed, temporarily  the presence of an odorant.Unlike the common cold, many Covid-19 patients also  -- the ability to sense the tingle of carbonation or burn of chili peppers.Unexplained anosmia is normally quite rare with other viral infections, especially in the absence of congestion or nasal blockage. If someone loses their sense of smell that is a good sign of a possible Covid-19 infection. In fact, recent analyses suggest that if you had to pick just one symptom,  of a Covid-19 diagnosis.Loss of smell is very specific to Covid-19, but not everyone with SARS-CoV-2 infection reports smell loss. Critically, being able to smell things does not mean you are Covid-free. If you were able to smell your coffee this morning, that is an ambiguous result: It might mean you don't have Covid-19, but it could also mean that you are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and simply .While fever checks have been widely deployed, they are not specific to Covid-19 -- many other illnesses, like the flu or strep throat, also cause fevers. Using loss of smell as a Covid-19 test is far from perfect. But because a daily smell check is very specific, instantaneous and quite literally free, it is a highly useful screening tool.The story of our graduate student's mom illustrates how active smell checks can catch Covid-19 cases in people with no other symptoms. At Penn State, where we work, we are putting this into action.This fall, the school launched our \"\" project to raise awareness of the connection between sudden smell loss and Covid-19. We even developed different \"sniff cards\" with a peel-and-smell panel so people could check their sense of smell with a standardized tool.While such a tool is preferable for research, doing a daily smell test for public health reasons does not require a bespoke sniff card. The test could be simply sniffing your morning cup of coffee or the shampoo you use in the shower.Smell checks cannot and will not catch every undiagnosed infection, since an estimated . But given that DIY smell tests can be done at zero cost, the downsides of using them for screening are minimal.Screening is one of the most basic tools of public health. The most critical factors for an effective Covid-19 screening tool are frequency and speed, with test sensitivity being secondary.It is easy to check your sense of smell -- who doesn't have a bag of coffee or tea in their kitchen or a bar of soap in the bathroom? And it is fast -- you know immediately if your milk went sour. Combine this with the high specificity of anosmia relative to other symptoms, and we believe daily at-home smell checks can help fill the need for a rapid, cheap and specific screening tool. Tracking sudden smell loss can even be used for population-level monitoring of Covid-19 cases within a country or region.Of course, no screening program will catch 100% of cases. It is critical for individuals to continue practicing other harm reduction behaviors. Still, we encourage you to Stop. Smell. Be well. And if you do lose your sense of smell, please self-isolate and contact a health professional.John E. Hayes is a professor of food science at Penn State.

{"text": "The associations between vaping cannabis and respiratory health symptoms haven't been fully known before — but one new study has revealed a key discovery.The  in the journal JAMA Network Open, found that vaping cannabis at any frequency was linked with symptoms of bronchitis and wheezing in young adults around 19 years old.Toward the end of 2019, mysterious cases of lung injury associated with using e-cigarettes or vaping products — described by the US Centers for Disease Control as  (which stands for e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury) — broke out. More than 2,800 people from all 50 states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands had been hospitalized for or died from EVALI by mid-February of 2020, according to the CDC.That was shortly before the spread of coronavirus, which can also harm a person's respiratory health if that person gets infected with coronavirus and then develops the respiratory disease Covid-19.   \"With (Covid-19) happening, we just kind of knew that people who had vaped nicotine or had vaped cannabis were presenting a unique respiratory illness that wasn't really well understood,\" said the study's first author Jessica Braymiller, a postdoctoral researcher at the Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science at the University of Southern California. \"The pandemic has really underscored the importance of understanding what could make respiratory symptoms worse.\" Since lungs are one primary organ severely affected by the virus, people who smoke and vape may be at  for serious illness and death from Covid-19, health experts have said.In an online questionnaire for the current study, more than 2,000 young adults who had recently graduated from Southern California high schools reported their history of vaping and smoking behaviors, and respiratory health symptoms. Participants who had vaped cannabis any number of times from within the last month to their overall lifetime had a stronger link to symptoms of bronchitis (daily cough, congestion and phlegm) in comparison to people who had never vaped cannabis. The more times those participants had vaped cannabis in the last month, the stronger the risk was. Vaping cannabis on three or more days in the past 30 days was associated with twice the risk of wheeze, and with experiencing whistling in one's chest during the past year — which is a  that, when heard while breathing, can indicate that your airways have narrowed or become inflamed. However, there were no significant associations between vaping nicotine and wheeze.The study \"continues to show the findings that inhalation leads to airway inflammation manifested\" as cough, mucus and wheeze, Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer of the American Lung Association, told CNN in an email.\"More research is needed to determine if these relatively short term observations are harbingers of chronic changes and the development of chronic lung diseases,\" Rizzo, who wasn't involved in the study, said.The study \"makes a good effort\" at trying to identify the risks of the types of inhaled exposures, Rizzo said — but there are a lot of potential differences in terms of the quality and quantity of devices people use, the ingredients and how long people vape. For example, some aerosolized forms of cannabis oil, such as those that are more concentrated, are more likely to cause respiratory health issues when inhaled. Different ways of vaping can increase the dose and exposure a person receives from whatever they are vaping. And  — an additive in some THC-containing e-liquids linked with e-cigarette and vaping-associated lung injuries of the 2019 outbreak — could have been present in the THC that some participants vaped, the study said. THC is , the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. The authors didn't have these details in their study — but said that longer studies on the links between cannabis vaping and respiratory symptoms, and on people who vape cannabis or nicotine only, are needed. \"The main takeaway is that using any kind of e-cigarettes has adverse effects for teenagers' health. Particularly so for putting cannabis in e-cigarettes,\" said Thomas Wills, professor and director of the Cancer Prevention in the Pacific Program at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center. \"Using cannabis obtained from illicit sources raises\" the additional risk of developing EVALI, Wills, who wasn't involved in the study, added. Although EVALI cases have declined, Wills said \"cases are still being noted among young people and a lot of these patients have to be put on ventilators. This is really something you don't want.\" There are a lot of scientists who still don't know about the effects of vaping on lung health, \"whether it is nicotine or cannabis products,\" Rizzo said. \"The best course of action to benefit your health is to refrain from the use of any tobacco products since we have abundant data on its health effects ... the answers are not in as yet regarding the long term effects of vaping cannabis products.\"Why vaping cannabis or nicotine would maybe cause different symptoms isn't yet fully known, USC's Braymiller said. But \"it could be that the chemical constituents of the e-liquids are different.\" \"When you vape anything really, there's this e-liquid that is in the device that is heated up and aerosolized and then inhaled,\" she added. \"There could be chemical differences in nicotine e-liquids versus cannabis e-liquids. And we would need more of toxicology or chemical studies to understand those differences a little bit better.\" All things considered, if you're concerned about your health, \"you should not vape,\" Rizzo said. \"Per the CDC, it is felt that individuals who smoke and possibly vape, might be at risk for increased complications if COVID-19 infection occurs.\" You should be aware of or monitoring for other symptoms such as fever, fatigue and loss of smell, he added, which could help you determine whether you should be tested for a coronavirus infection. Parents of youth who use cannabis should \"subtly\" ask their children whether they are smoking combustible marijuana or including cannabis in e-cigarettes, Wills said. \"Any individual that has or develops the above symptoms, especially in this time of COVID-19, should discuss the symptoms with their health care provider,\" Rizzo said.

{"text": "The nearly yearlong  has been full of gloomy numbers but Wednesday brought an encouraging one -- more than 1 million people have received their first shot of a Covid-19 vaccine.And that reported number is low, because many doses administrated in recent days have yet to be tabulated in the figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency said.\"With cases of COVID-19 continuing to surge nationwide, this achievement comes at a critical time and will help to protect those on the frontlines -- our healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients -- as well as our most vulnerable: elder individuals living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities,\" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said. The government has said it intends to distribute 20 million first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in the coming weeks. So far, about 9.5 million doses have been distributed.\"It's been a big week of delivery of vaccines,\" Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, told reporters Wednesday. \"Over 7,800 deliveries by the end of tomorrow, as we are delivering the 7.9 million doses of vaccine that were allocated for this week around the country -- really a tremendous feat.\"Perna said about 15.5 million doses of vaccine have been allocated and another 4.5-5 million will be allotted next week.\"We'll finish those deliveries in the first week of January,\" he said.Health officials like , long-time director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have said vaccines will help put the pandemic behind us -- but most Americans, who , need to be vigilant with mask and social distancing measures for the next few months.Thanks to coordinated efforts among the US Department of Health and Human Services and two major drugstore chains, Covid-19 vaccines have reached 238 long-term care facilities in 12 states, Perna said. \"Walgreens and CVS are being received by cheering crowds, and they're operationalizing their efforts to make sure everybody gets the shots,\" Perna said during a media briefing.Perna said 13 more states and another 1,000 facilities with residents requiring long-term care will receive vaccine doses next week.\"Every week we're just building on that as we go,\" he said.The chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed predicted officials will start to see a decline in the number of people dying as more of the most vulnerable people are inoculated.\"Within two weeks from starting to immunize subjects that are living in long-term care facilities, we should start to see a decrease in the overall mortality in the country,\"  Moncef Slaoui said.It is reasonable to assume the protection against severe disease provided by both Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines will translate into prevention of death, Slaoui said.He said the priority should be to maximize the number of people in long-term care facilities who are vaccinated.\"There are enough vaccine doses to immunize more or less 3 million individuals that are living in such facilities,\" Slaoui said.Thousands more families just lost a loved one this holiday season as the US reported its  — 3,401 on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. And by Wednesday evening, another 3,300 deaths were announced.Hospitalizations were at an all-time high at 119,463.In nine states, more people are hospitalized with Covid-19 than at any other point in this pandemic: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Mississippi, New Hampshire and North Carolina, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Doctors say many deaths happening now were likely fueled by Thanksgiving travel andgatherings, since Covid-19 deaths typically happen .\"We were bracing for this and hoping that we were wrong,\" said Dr. Esther Choo, a professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health & Science University.\"But every holiday has been similar. And Thanksgiving, we saw the kind of travel that happened then. And people who are hospitalized in ICUs and dying now -- many of them are because of the Thanksgiving surge.\"Health experts like Choo and Fauci, say the next 10 days could spark even more infections, hospitalizations and deaths than Thanksgiving did.\"Now we have an extended holiday between Christmas and New Year's. And according to AAA estimates, even though this year's travel is about 30% less than last year, it still means that  over the holidays,\" Choo said. \"And it's not just the travel, it's what's happening on the other end -- where they're traveling to -- which is a lot of family-and-friend gatherings. So I think we are already bracing for the outcome of that, which will be well into the end of January, into February. ... And I have no doubt it will be surge on top of surge on top of surge.\" Around the world, a  is prompting concerns -- including whether it's more transmissible and whether current Covid-19 vaccines will work against it.  \"I think I can be mostly reassuring,\" said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the US National Institutes of Health. \"First of all, this is not a surprise. This virus is an RNA virus. RNA viruses tend to change their instruction books slowly over time, which results in these kinds of variants emerging,\" he said.\"The good news is that the antibodies that these vaccines generate are quite effective in terms of attaching to multiple parts of the spike protein. And so if there's a change in it -- which is what the mutant has done -- we would expect that the vaccine should still be effective against that.\" Pfizer and Moderna, makers of the two vaccines currently being deployed in the US, said they're testing their vaccines to see if they work against the new strain, which was first detected in the UK. Scientists advising the UK government estimated the new strain could be up to 70% more transmissible than other variants.Peter Horby, chair of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), said Monday that experts \"now have high confidence that this variant does have a transmission advantage\" over other variants. The UK variant doesn't appear to cause more severe disease, and it appears that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines will still be effective.So far, the strain \"has not been identified through sequencing efforts in the United States, although viruses have only been sequenced from about 51,000 of the 17 million US cases,\" the CDC said Tuesday.\"Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected.\"Some researchers think the strain likely arrived in the US in mid-November, and that many people in the US could already be infected with it.\"If I had to guess, I would say it's probably in hundreds of people by now,\" said Michael Worobey, head of the University of Arizona's department of ecology and evolutionary biology. \"It's very possible it's arrived multiple times in multiple places.\"CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas, Haley Brink, Shelby Lin Erdman, Elizabeth Cohen and Naomi Thomas contributed to this report.", "summary": "The nearly yearlong coronavirus pandemic has been full of gloomy numbers but Wednesday brought an encouraging one -- more than 1 million people have received their first shot of a Covid-19 vaccine."},
{"text": "Michael Worobey, a biologist at the University of Arizona, has seen more than 100,000 different strains of the virus that causes Covid-19. But when he saw the new variant from the UK, he noticed something different.  \"This is the first variant I've seen during the whole pandemic where I took a step back and said: 'Whoa,' \" he remembers.   Health officials have downplayed the possibility that the coronavirus vaccines won't work against the UK strain, but Worobey and other scientists thinks it's a possibility -- and it's just a possibility -- that this new variant might, to a small extent, outsmart the vaccines.  \"This is the first variant I've seen where I think there is this burning question,\" said Worobey, head of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona.   Trevor Bedford, an associate professor in the vaccine and infectious disease division of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, is also keeping a close eye on the UK variant.   Large clinical trials have shown that the vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are about 95% effective against the novel coronavirus. Those trials, however, were done before the UK variant started its explosive growth.   Bedford said he doesn't believe the vaccine will be useless against the new UK strain, but that it might lower its effectiveness somewhat.   \"It might decrease vaccine efficacy from 95% to something like 80% or 85%,\" he said. \"It would be a modest effect, not a dramatic effect.\"   Health officials have said there's no reason to think the vaccine won't work against the new variant.   \"[There is] no evidence to suggest, nor reason to believe, that it would evade our vaccines that we have right now,\" Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir said Monday.   \"This particular variant in the UK, I think, is very unlikely to have escaped the vaccine immunity,\" Moncef Slaoui, the head of Operation Warp Speed, said Sunday.  But some scientists point out that this mutation isn't like others that have preceded it.  \"We shouldn't immediately jump to the conclusion (as many have done) that it  a concern,\" Kristian Andersen, a professor in the department of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research Andersen wrote to CNN. \"We simply don't know at this point in time -- but we should know more soon.\"   Bette Korber, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, has also been examining the variant.   \"The mutations are indeed worrisome, they ALL need to be tested,\" Bette Korber, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, wrote to CNN when asked if the new mutation was a concern for the vaccine.   The UK variant has an unusually large number of mutations -- 14 changes and 3 deletions in its genetic code that impact the building blocks of its proteins, .   \"This virus has like 17 unique mutations that haven't been seen elsewhere, and that is really unusual,\" Worobey said. \"The accrual of 14 lineage-specific amino acid replacements prior to its detection is, to date, unprecedented in the global virus genomic data for the Covid-19 pandemic,\" British scientists last week. It's not just the number of mutations that has some scientists worried, but the way they might work together.    \"Many of these mutations have been characterized in the lab and we know something about them. However, their combination (along with other changes) has not been characterized,\"  on Tuesday.   Pfizer and Moderna are  the vaccine to see if it works against the new variant.   Dr. Ugur Sahin, the CEO of BioNTech, said he does not think the new variant will cause a problem, but if it does, the vaccine can be updated.  \"We should not forget that we have still the opportunity, if required, to adjust the vaccine exactly to this new virus variant, if this is needed,\" Sahin said. \"I don't think that this is needed.

{"text": "The very fast decision to grant emergency use authorization to the first coronavirus vaccine in the United States cut no corners and was based on a deep review of safety and efficacy data, two top US Food and Drug Administration officials said Saturday.The FDA granted the EUA -- the first ever for a vaccine for use in the general public in the United States -- late Friday, just a day after advisers recommended it.The FDA has been pummeled by a White House clamoring for a fast win and caught between public forces desperate for something -- anything -- to help fight a pandemic that has killed close to 300,000 Americans, but also deeply suspicious of new scientific technology developed in a highly charged political atmosphere.FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said his agency's scientists, considered the best in the world, stayed above the upheaval as they reviewed the data about Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine.\"Science and data guided the FDA's decision,\" Hahn told a Saturday morning news conference carried by webcast and broadcast over social media.The FDA listened to the advice of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), a group of experts with no financial ties to the vaccine process, who voted 17-4 with one abstention to recommend EUA of the vaccine after two public meetings.\"We held a public advisory committee on Thursday about the Pfizer and BioNTech application,\" Hahn said. \"The committee overwhelmingly agreed that the vaccine's benefits outweighs its risks.\"Hahn said the FDA has been transparent about the data.\"We've also posted important information to help health care providers understand the benefits, risks and proper use of this FDA authorized vaccine,\" said Hahn.EUA is a process that's quicker than full approval -- something that can take months or even years for a vaccine. But Dr. Peter Marks, who heads FDA's vaccine division, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said repeatedly the EUA standard would only be slightly short of what would be required for full licensure.Hahn said the FDA reviewed not just Pfizer and BioNTech's summary of their clinical trial involving around 40,000 volunteers, but went through to original source data. It showed the vaccine was safe and provided 95% protection. \"Our incredible team, heroic efforts, night and day worked to get this out the door,\" Hahn said.\"As Dr. Marks said, thousands of people are dying a day.\"And Hahn said he was aware that many Americans may be nervous about getting the vaccine.\"The agency is very concerned about vaccine hesitancy,\" Hahn said.\"We are also aware that some feel that the speed with which this development and then regulatory process took place might give them concerns about the vaccine,\" he added.The FDA has addressed the hesitancy, Hahn said, by being transparent about the science behind Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine and the process for authorizing it.\"We believe that that transparency, as well as the rigorous scientific review that we've done, goes a long way to providing confidence and trust in the American people and FDA and this vaccine,\" he said.The FDA also , which rolled out the vaccine ahead of the US. After two people who got the vaccine in Britain experienced allergic reactions, the FDA added warning language to the vaccine's label that cautions about the possibility. Hahn said the FDA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would make sure that emergency supplies would be on hand at all vaccination sites to handle any allergic reactions.And the FDA promises to closely follow safety data as million of Americans receive the vaccine.\"While this year has been marked by tragedy, sadness and sacrifice, it is also a year that has generated unparalleled scientific achievement that will resonate for many future generations,\" Hahn said.Hahn also answered questions about political pressure. As the FDA made its decision, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize what he saw as the agency's slowness. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told Hahn he needed to grant the EUA by the end of the day Friday, and if not, he would have to resign, an administration official and a source familiar with the situation told CNN.FDA's EUA came on Friday evening.\"First of all the representations in the press that I was threatened to be fired if we didn't get it done by a certain date is inaccurate,\" Hahn said.\"Dr. Marks and I have been very clear from the beginning  that we are going to maintain the integrity of the scientific process. We are going to let our scientists do their job and review and go through the fairness of that review, the gold standard if you will,\" Hahn added.\"But we also recognize the urgency of the situation and so we have said repeatedly we will work as quickly as we can to come to a decision and that's what we did. Our team, the scientists, met after the VRBPAC meeting. They did come to the conclusion that the vaccine did meet our standard for effectiveness and safety. And as you know, before 7 a.m. on Friday, we issued a statement saying that we were working with the sponsor to move toward authorization.\"Hahn and Marks answered other questions about the vaccine. Pfizer's immunization is given as two doses, as is Moderna's, which comes up for VRBPAC consideration December 17.While some of Pfizer's data indicated it might provide as such as 50% protection after a single dose, Marks said it would be \"foolhardy\" to consider granting permission to give just one dose -- even if that would stretch scarce supplies in a pandemic.\"The way the regimen was studied was that everyone, ultimately, or almost everyone received two doses of the vaccine, so we only know how people were protected with two doses of the vaccine,\" Marks said. \"We spent so much time carefully reviewing the data and basing our decisions on science, right, that it seems pretty foolhardy to just conjecture that one dose might be OK without knowing,\" he added.\"So at least from the FDA perspective, we would be recommending that people complete the two-dose series so we actually know that they're truly protected at the rate of approximately 95% of efficacy.\"The FDA is also confident that, although the Pfizer vaccine is delicate, it can be safely distributed.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at about minus 75 degrees Celsius -- far colder than any vaccine currently used in the United States. The vaccines are using specially designed shippers with dry ice, and they can remain refrigerated for a few days once thawed.FDA made clear in the labeling how the vaccine will need to be handled, Marks said, and the CDC and Operation Warp Speed \"are making sure that things are in place to make sure that the cold chain is maintained.\"\"We're pretty convinced that we can, we can make this happen here,\" Marks said. \"We've seen cold chains maintained in in locations that are pretty, pretty rural or pretty rough in, for instance, with vaccination campaigns in Africa.

One dose is to prime the body, and then a few weeks later, the second dose is to boost the response. The messenger RNA or mRNA used in the vaccine codes for a structure called the spike glycoprotein of the virus. That's the part of the virus that it uses to attach to cells. The vaccine prompts the human body to produce copies of that protein, eliciting an immune response that leads to some protection against coronavirus infection.Such mRNA vaccines are the newest approach to vaccine technology.Safety and efficacy data on Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine candidate published in the  on Thursday morning.The data come from more than 43,000 trial participants: 21,720 who were randomly given the vaccine and 21,728 who were randomly given a placebo.

The document adds that swollen lymph nodes also may be related to vaccination.Overall, \"there are currently insufficient data to make conclusions about the safety of the vaccine in subpopulations such as children less than 16 years of age, pregnant and lactating individuals, and immunocompromised individuals,\" according to the document.In a FDA advisory committee meeting on Thursday, FDA official Dr. Marion Gruber said the fact sheet and prescribing information provided with Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine will warn that people with a history of severe allergic reactions to any of the vaccine's components should not get it.In the United Kingdom, officials are investigating  that two health care workers with a significant history of severe allergic reactions experienced after receiving the vaccine.As vaccine doses get distributed across the country, state and local officials will oversee the  as well as the logistics -- and health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities are prioritized to receive the vaccine first.At this point, the number of doses each state is getting in its first shipment is fluid and, in many cases, the amount is , leading states to change distribution plans.In most cases, the first shipments of the vaccine will be transported from Pfizer's facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, to hospital systems and pharmacies.The distribution from vaccine production company to individual hospitals and pharmacies in each state as directed by the federal government, is different for almost every state. State health department officials are coordinating with federal officials in Operation Warp Speed. However, there is no clear roadmap that explains how this process is working simultaneously in all 50 states.Instead, states have developed individualized vaccine distribution plans that vary slightly for each individual state's demographic and geographic needs.CDC officials have been in close contact with state leaders about how their distribution plans will work and challenges that could crop up state to state.CNN's Andrea Kane, , ,  and  contributed to this report.", "summary": "The US Food and Drug Administration has authorized the first Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use in the United States.

The news followed Saturday's vote by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to recommend the vaccine for people ages 16 and older. That came after the US Food and Drug Administration had authorized the vaccine for emergency use on Friday. Here's what we know about the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. Now that CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield has accepted the ACIP's recommendation, vaccinations can begin. This CDC advisory group had previously recommended that health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be the first to receive a vaccine when it receives EUA. The , so states will  the vaccine first.Both groups are \"exceptionally high risk,\" , chair of the ACIP, which voted earlier this month to recommend those groups be included in what it called Phase 1a of its distribution plan.Keeping doctors and nurses healthy will be important for the continuing fight against the virus, which will stretch on for months, even after a vaccine is authorized. But Romero said that first group includes other people working in health care institutions, like those who deliver food and perform housekeeping.\"Anybody that works within a health care institution that could have contact with an individual who has Covid should receive vaccination,\" Romero previously told CNN.Residents of long-term care facilities like nursing homes also need the protection. So far, they account for about 40% of coronavirus deaths in the US.Army Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of the federal government vaccine initiative Operation Warp Speed, previously said he believed vaccine administration will be able to begin vaccinations within 96 hours of authorization.CVS, which is preparing to begin vaccinations in long-term care facilities, said that December 21 would be the earliest vaccine administration can start in the facilities.\"We'll be in facilities that day in states that choose to begin as soon as possible,\" spokesman Ethan Slavin said.The FDA is set to make a decision on a separate vaccine candidate by Moderna in the coming days. If it's also authorized, it's possible that 20 million people could get vaccinated in the next several weeks, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told CNN on Wednesday.The CDC is  to distribute vaccines. Phase 1a would be followed by Phases 1b and 1c, which could include essential workers at high risk of infection, other emergency personnel and people with underlying conditions who are at a higher risk of Covid-19 complications and death.But it will likely be months before the vaccine is widely available to the rest of the population.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday night that the groups receiving the vaccine in December, January, February and March will likely include those in \"high priority groups.\"\"I would project by the time you get to April, it will be ... 'open season,' in the sense of anyone, even the non-high priority groups could get vaccinated,\" Fauci said. In the meantime, it's important that people continue to wear masks and social distance. At this time, the federal government has secured just 100 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine, though .It's important to note, however, that Pfizer's vaccine requires two doses administered several weeks apart to reach 95% efficacy. So 100 million doses would vaccinate half the number of people.Again, not all of those doses will be available at once. Azar said earlier this month that 6.4 million doses of Pfizer vaccine would be allocated for shipment the first week. The initial shipment would include half of the doses, followed by the second half three weeks later.States will be getting shipments of the vaccine once a week to begin with, Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Moncef Slaoui said Friday, and governors will be told a week in advance how many doses they will be getting.The number of doses will increase weekly because manufacturing will ramp up, Slaoui told CNN's Jake Tapper.Slaoui said he believes most doses will be injected within three to four days, but after that, \"I think it will take a week.\"There are a number of vaccines in development by other companies as well. Azar told CNN the US has the ability to purchase up to 3 billion doses of vaccines from six manufacturers, including Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi/GSK and Novavax.Shipping the vaccine will be a daunting task, and the . The first shipments of the vaccine departed a Pfizer plant in Michigan on Sunday morning. A total of 189 boxes of vials are expected to arrive in all 50 states Monday. Another 3,900 vials are expected to ship later Sunday to US territories. Another 400 boxes packed with about 390,000 vials are expected to ship Monday and arrive at their destinations on Tuesday. UPS and FedEx have both said they will help with distribution following authorization. The vaccines will then be flown across the country, and  its air traffic controllers will prioritize flights carrying the vaccines. FedEx and UPS will be involved in transporting the vaccines on the ground, delivering them to facilities where they will be administered, like hospitals and long-term care facilities.But Pfizer's vaccine , making the logistics of delivery even more complicated. The vaccine will be shipped in special containers packed with dry ice. Upon arrival at their destination, the vaccines will then be stored in ultra-cold freezers at minus 70 degrees Celsius, or 94 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. Pfizer's clinical trials have shown no severe side effects. According to a briefing document released by the FDA's vaccine advisory committee, the most common side effects were reactions at the point of injection on the body, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever. Severe adverse reactions occurred in less than 4.6% of trial participants and were less frequent in older adults compared to younger participants. , where the vaccine roll out began earlier this week, said Wednesday that people with \"significant history of allergic reactions\" should not receive the vaccine.

{"text": "Shipments of the Covid-19 vaccine are arriving, with  getting immunized -- some for the cameras -- across the United States Monday.While these developments mark a historic moment and hold much promise, that doesn't mean Americans can stop wearing masks anytime soon. CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, explains why.This is a good question! It's important to be clear about what we know and what we don't know about what the vaccine does. What we know is that the Pfizer vaccine is very effective at preventing symptomatic illness and severe disease. That means the vaccine appears to prevent people from getting sick enough that they develop symptoms, and very importantly, it prevents people from becoming so severely ill that they end up in the hospital. This is really great news.Here's what the studies don't yet show. They haven't looked at whether the vaccine prevents someone from carrying Covid-19 and spreading it to others. It's possible that someone could get the vaccine but could still be an asymptomatic carrier. They may not show symptoms, but they have the virus in their nasal passageway so that if they're speaking, breathing, sneezing and so on, they can still transmit it to others. This is the main reason why we can't stop wearing masks right after we get the vaccine. The vaccine will protect you from getting ill and then ending up hospitalized. But it's possible that you could still carry the virus and be contagious to others. So those who get the vaccine should still be wearing masks and practicing physical distancing. No, not forever, but for a while longer. It's estimated that about 70% of Americans must be vaccinated before we get to herd immunity through vaccination. That's the point where enough people have the immune protection that the virus won't spread any more. This means about 230 million Americans must receive the vaccine. It will take time to produce this many vaccines — and remember the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are two-dose vaccines, so you need double the number of doses as people. Then the vaccine must be distributed and actually given to people. If all goes well, the best estimates are that it will be late spring or early summer for most Americans to receive the vaccine. At that point, we could probably see one another without masks — but not before. Already, vaccine development has proceeded with incredible speed. The fastest that a vaccine was developed before this pandemic was four years. We now have an authorized vaccine within less than a year.How quickly we reach herd immunity will depend on production, distribution and the willingness of the American people to take the vaccine. There is a concern that many Americans may not take the vaccine even if it's available. We need to have a thoughtful public education campaign that's tailored to different communities. And we need everyone's help! When it's your turn, please take the vaccine. Help spread the word and convince your family and friends about the importance of the vaccine to saving lives and ending this pandemic.  For now, everyone needs to keep wearing masks. There will be small numbers of individuals who cannot get vaccines. In the beginning, children won't be able to get vaccines because it hasn't yet been tested on children. It's also possible that there are some medical conditions that make it such that certain people can't get the vaccine, or that the vaccine is less effective for them. That's why the rest of us have to get vaccinated, to protect them. Herd immunity is also called community immunity: The community is getting vaccinated to protect everyone.That's also why we keep wearing masks, too. We do it to protect ourselves, and to protect others. Remember that even after we get the vaccine, we can spread the virus to others. Also, the vaccine is very effective but it isn't 100%. The mask still protects you, too.Yes. I'll do it to protect others, and to protect myself, too. Here's another way to think about the importance of mask wearing. The vaccine protects you if the virus reaches your nose and your mouth. Your body senses the virus, and instead of the virus attacking your body, your body's immune system kicks in and gets rid of the virus. It's very important to prevent the virus from reaching your body in the first place. Wearing a mask does that. So does physical distancing. These are really important measures to prevent from getting coronavirus and transmitting it to others.You will certainly see mask wearing among health care workers, who will be among the first groups to get the vaccine. The vaccine is one important layer of protection for us, but we will use these other measures to protect ourselves and those around us. Absolutely. It's really astounding that we have a vaccine that looks to be 95% effective and very safe. We will be able to put an end to the pandemic. But this will take time. The initial allotment of vaccines will reach just over 1% of the population. It will take time to scale up to reach 70%. We need for everyone to keep following the precautions we've been talking about all along: Wear a mask. Keep physical distancing. Avoid indoor gatherings. Wash your hands. I'll add one more: Get the vaccine when it's your turn. We can get through this winter, and the spring and summer hold so much promise.", "summary": "Shipments of the Covid-19 vaccine are arriving across the United States. That doesn't mean, however, that Americans can stop wearing masks anytime soon. CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen explains why."},
{"text": "With Covid-19 surging in the United States, transmission of the novel coronavirus is at an all-time high. A new analysis that looked at 54 studies in over 20 countries found homes where someone was sick with Covid-19 continued to be hotspots for virus transmission, even if overall community spread was down.\"This isyet another study that reminds us of how contagious the virus that causes Covid-19 is, and how hard it is to keep from infecting others if one lives in crowded, multigenerational housing,\" said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health,who was not involved in the study.Spouses were at higher risk than other family members, likely due to sleeping in the same room, intimacy and prolonged contact, Risk was higher if the family member showed symptoms of Covid-19 -- such as cough, sneezing, body aches, chills and fever -- than if the person showed few or no signs of the virus, the study found. Risk was also higher between adults than between adults and children. A  found infection among household members occurred quickly. Over half of the people (53%) who lived with someone battling Covid-19 became infected within a week, researchers found. Some 75% of these secondary infections occurred within five days of the first symptoms in the initial patient.Fewer than half of infected household members had symptoms at the time infection was first detected.\"Many reported no symptoms throughout 7 days of follow-up, underscoring the potential for transmission from asymptomatic secondary contacts and the importance of quarantine,\" the CDC team reported.Staying isolated from other household members is challenging, especially if you are in a small space or there are children in the home.\"If you have somebody at home who's older or immunocompromised, you may want to isolate them to one side of the house so the kids and everybody else aren't around them on a regular basis,\" said pediatrician Dr. Tanya Altmann, editor in chief of the American Academy of Pediatrics' book \"Caring for Your Baby and Young Child: Birth to Age 5 and The Wonder Years,\" .\"If it's a child that you have to care for, then you may have to make the decision to isolate one adult with the child,\" she added. \"That adult would be caring for the child and the other adult would be responsible for the rest of thefamily.\"And of course, all of this will be extremely difficult for a single parent \"who might be the only one,\" said pediatrician Dr. Jenny Radesky, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, .\"Know who your neighbors are, even what your neighborhood social network might be,\" said Radesky, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan. \"You may not be that close interpersonally, but someone may be willing to do a grocery store drop-off or pick-up medications, because we're all in this together.\"The rest of the family should practice isolation as well, Radesky added.\"Unfortunately you need to keep the whole household under isolation,\" she said. \"The patterns of Covid-19 spread suggest that clusters of people who live close together are at highest risk of getting it from one another. If children are part of that household, they may show minimal symptoms but still be contagious.\"Consider having everyone living in home wear a mask inside. Doing so was 79% effective at preventing the spread of the virus, , when family members started wearing masks before symptoms emerged in the first person infected.If you live alone, your challenge is to monitor your symptoms and care for yourself when you're not feeling well. Be sure to have a plan in place to get food and medications delivered to your home, and find someone who can be responsible for virtually checking in on you on a regular basis.Stock or ask loved ones to provide the room with all relevant forms of entertainment: TV, computer, iPad, books, even games that you could play via FaceTime or Skype.Don't hesitate to order online or ask loved ones to provide basic supplies, which include:Everyone in the home should keep a face mask on, unless you or your loved one is having \"trouble breathing\" or is \"unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance,\" Maximize isolation and protective actions, Altmann stressed.\"You can have a healthy person leave the sick one food and drinks at the door, and then go wash their hands,\" Altmann explained. \"Wear gloves to pick up the empty plates, take them back to the kitchen and wash them in hot water with soap, or preferably with a dishwasher, and wash your hands again.\"Do not share drinking glasses, cups, forks or other eating utensils or dishes, the CDC says. Don't share towels or bedding with other people in your home. When doing laundry, don't shake the sick person's dirty clothes to \"minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.\"And caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling that dirty laundry, the CDC says, throwing them away after each use.\"If using reusable gloves, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for Covid-19 and should not be used for other household purposes. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed,\" the CDC advises.What happens if there is only one bathroom in the home? \"If everyone has to use to use the same bathroom, try to leave at least two hours after the person in isolation has used it before someone else goes,\" Wen advised.Dedicate a lined trash can for any tissues or other paper or disposable products used by a sick person, the CDC says, adding that caregivers should \"use gloves when removing garbage bags, handling and disposing of trash. Wash hands after handling or disposing of trash.\"And remember: Call 911 immediately if you or your loved ones have any of these symptoms: increased or sudden difficulty breathing or shortness of breath; a persistent pain or pressure in the chest; and any sign of oxygen deprivation, such as new confusion, bluish lips or face, or you can't arouse the sick person.To be clear: After a positive Covid-19 diagnosis, everyone in the house needs to isolate themselves from the outside world as much as possible.\"I would recommend that families find friends who can drop off essential groceries or medications, not go to work, and not play with other children -- even outside,\" Radesky said.\"If you don't have friends who can drop off groceries or essential items, see if the local stores can deliver the items for you. I'm sure they would appreciate not having a potential Covid-19 exposure in their store,\" she added.If a family member without symptoms believes it is absolutely essential to go outside to the grocery store, pharmacy or to check on a family member, be aware that you may well be contagious and anything you touch could transfer the virus -- even without symptoms.\"I would urge people not to do this,\" Radesky said. \"The way we will beat this virus is by reducing the number of times that each infected person transmits the virus to another person. So the more you can do to stop the virus in its tracks -- in other words, your family doesn't give it to anyone else, and you don't bring it to your workplace or a local store -- the sooner we will be done with this!\"To reduce virus transfer inside your home, try to keep an air flow in the rest of the home with opened windows or doors with screens, if weather permits. The CDC says \"improving ventilation helps remove respiratory droplets from the air,\"\"I'd keep windows open in all shared spaces,\" advised Wen. \"Also, an air purifier with a HEPA filter could help. So would a humidifier, as viruses linger longer in dry air -- especially in the shared space.\"Have everyone wash their hands at every opportunity. Clean and disinfect all those commonly shared surfaces -- don't forget the refrigerator and microwave handles!Keep everyone as stress-free as possible -- a hard task for sure -- and focus on healthy eating, regular exercise and quality sleep.Even though there is no indication that pets can give or get Covid-19, the CDC suggests keeping pets away from sick people.\"Since animals can spread other diseases to people, it's always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals,\" the CDC says. \"If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.\"If you tested positive but had  you can stop isolating at home 10 days after the date you had your positive test, .For those with symptoms, the CDC says you can be around others when:\"A limited number of persons with severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days that may warrant extending duration of isolation and precautions for up to 20 days after symptom onset,\" the CDC says. Consider consultation with infection control experts, the agency says. A loss of taste and smell can remain for weeks or even months after recovery, the CDC notes, but that does not mean you need to remain isolated.However, if you have a severely weakened immune system or were more severely sick with Covid-19 -- such as being admitted to a hospital and needing oxygen -- the rules change, according to the CDC: ​\"Your healthcare provider may recommend that you stay in isolation for longer than 10 days after your symptoms first appeared (possibly up to 20 days),\" the CDC says.\"Persons who are severely immunocompromised may require testing to determine when they can be around others. Talk to your healthcare provider for more information.\" These are scary times, but hopefully these tips will help ease your anxiety and prepare you and your family for the worst, while hoping and striving for the best.", "summary": "If someone in your home has Covid-19, you're at a red-alert risk for transmission.

{"text": "A vaccine kit sent to the wrong state. A hospital system in California expecting to get powdered vaccines instead of frozen vials. And tens of thousands of people expect to get vaccinated in the coming weeks, when in reality they are going to have to wait for months.The rollout of the first coronavirus vaccine is already messy, and it has only been authorized since late Friday night.The US Food and Drug Administration  to Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine Friday,  and it's widely expected to grant EUA to Moderna's similar vaccine next week. Vaccinations began Monday and are under way in all 50 states and in US territories.The federal government's Operation Warp Speed has been gearing up and holding news conferences headlined by generals promising a military-style rollout. But jokes about military precision aside, experts are already expecting a lot of confusion, a fair amount of fear and more than a little outrage.\"The public has to be cognizant that there is going to be unfairness or error or sometimes just stupidity,\" said Juliette Kayyem, a security specialist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and former assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration.Here are some of the problems the US public can expect to see with any mass vaccination effort.It's clear there will not be enough vaccines for everyone who wants one right away. Pfizer is only expected to be able to supply 2.9 million doses in the first few days and only up to 6.4 million doses by December 19, according to Operation Warp Speed, the government's vaccine effort. Both Pfizer and Moderna together can only supply, at the most, 40 million doses by the end of the month.Vaccine advisers have already broken down priority groups into subgroups, and have only designated the very, very first people to get vaccines. Those in this 1a group designated by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will include frontline health care workers and people in long-term care homes.But even that small group already outnumbers the vaccine supply. It's about 24 million people, and 40 million doses will only cover 20 million. Hospitals are planning to triage.\"I think we anticipate that we will not have enough for everybody at once. It's not going to be a one and done event,\" Dr. Marci Drees, chief infection prevention officer and hospital epidemiologist for Delaware-based ChristianaCare, told CNN. \"We don't know exactly how many vaccines we'll get.\"Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Moncef Slaoui has projected Pfizer and Moderna together can make and deliver 60 million to 70 million vaccines in January, and hopes two other vaccines makers, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, will join the mix of authorized vaccines in the coming months.\"We can immunize 20 million in December, 30 million in January, 50 million in February,\" Slaoui said at the White House Tuesday. But he doesn't project having vaccinated the full population until June.And that's assuming nothing goes wrong with manufacturing. Moderna and Pfizer each say they can make up to a billion doses by the end of 2021, but Moderna says it might be half that -- it's never made a product for sale before -- and Pfizer has already severely adjusted its timeline for vaccine delivery after unspecified manufacturing problems. ACIP is the main group advising the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which in turn offers guidance to states. State and local authorities make their own decisions on who gets vaccinated, and when. The decision to vaccinate health care workers, nursing home residents and patients in rehabilitation facilities first was an easy one --people want doctors, nurses, technicians and others to be able to safely care for everyone, and long-term care facility residents have made up 40% of deaths so far.But it's going to get sticky after that.A big chunk of Americans fall into one high-risk group or another -- especially since obesity raises the risk of severe disease, and more than 40% of Americans are obese. People over 65, people with diabetes, people with kidney disease, ethnic minorities, people with other chronic conditions -- it will be hard to choose just a few of these groups to go next.And what about essential workers? The groups advising ACIP, including Johns Hopkins University and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, say it would be prudent to vaccinate people who work in food production, emergency workers and utility workers ahead of the general population.ACIP member Dr. Robert Atmar, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine, said  ACIP will likely put essential workers into group 1b. \"That would include teachers, people in law enforcement, firefighters and a variety of other groups, and then 1c would be persons with underlying conditions who had higher risk of developing complications or dying should they get Covid-19 and that would include persons over the age of 65,\" he said.But even that could seem unfair, Kayyem said.\"There are a lot of people who are 64 years and 300 days who will say, 'in just a couple of weeks I could be in the next pool,'\" Kayyem said. \"It is going to seem somewhat unfeeling.\"Organizations representing patients with various chronic conditions have started lobbying to ensure their particular patient populations of interest are included in the early target groups.\"There is no doubt that our country must give first access to populations most at risk for the worst of Covid-19's complications -- including 34 million Americans living with diabetes,\" American Diabetes Association CEO Tracey Brown argued \"In discussion of who should qualify for Phase 1b access to a vaccine, ACIP thus far has discussed individuals with high-risk medical conditions, namely cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), immunocompromised state from solid organ transplant, obesity, a serious heart condition, sickle cell disease, and type 2 diabetes,\" the Muscular Dystrophy Association wrote in a letter to ACIP.\"MDA strongly believes that individuals living with a neuromuscular disease should be included in Phase 1b of vaccination administration due to the complexity of the multisystem impact of neuromuscular diseases that results in co-morbidities that cause a high risk for adverse Covid outcomes.\"Kayyem also envisions a rural versus urban divide. \"It is very likely you are going to want the Pfizer vaccine to go to urban areas because it has to be frozen. That easier to do in urban areas than in rural areas,\" she said. For instance, the head of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii told CNN last month that not a single hospital in Hawaii had a freezer that can stay cold enough to store Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine and the state may not have enough access to dry ice to make proper use of the company's distribution boxes.And because the vaccines must be stored carefully and require two doses, some local decisions may be made to make efficient use of the vaccines. Some counties, for instance, may decide to vaccinate all staff and residents of nursing homes -- even those who do not fall into designated priority groups. Others may offer vaccines to relatives so they can visit and help care for their loved ones. Some hospitals may opt to vaccinate patients along with staff to make good use of their vaccine allocations.Susan Froehlich of Dallas was pretty sure she got the real vaccine and not a placebo when she volunteered to take part in a clinical trial testing Moderna's vaccine. \"About 12 hours after I got the booster, it was 2:30 in the morning and I woke up with a terrible stomach ache and a headache and it was like I was at the beginning stages of a bad flu,\" Froehlich told CNN's coronavirus town hall last week\"It was like every part of my body was hurting for about four hours,\" Froehlich added. She felt better after taking naproxen.It's not unexpected. Slaoui has said up to 15% of Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trial participants have \"quite noticeable side effects\" including nausea, body aches, headaches and chills.\"I think those side effects are somewhat common,\" Slaoui told CNN earlier this month. They resolve quickly, but CDC and other officials are worried they might scare some people away from getting a second dose of the vaccine and are preparing educational materials to let people know the symptoms are a sign the vaccine is working to rev up the body's immune response and are harmless.Hospitals and the military are also planning around the possibility of having staff out sick after getting the shots. \"You don't want to vaccinate everybody on the same day,\" Drees said. Instead, several hospitals have said they'll stagger vaccinations just in case significant numbers of staff miss a few hours or even a day of work after getting the shot.Pfizer's vaccine has already had its first scare in the US, with a  suffering an allergic reaction. She recovered with quick treatment.were also reported during the rollout in Britain. Both patients recovered, but the incidents were enough to delay the US EUA by several hours while the FDA  for the vaccine.\"About one out of every million people that get a vaccine can have a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine,\" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN.In September, AstraZeneca paused its coronavirus vaccine trials because of a severe adverse event in a volunteer. The company later said one volunteer had \"an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis\" and a second volunteer had \"an unexplained illness.\" An internal company document pointed to a rare neurological condition called transverse myelitis. The trials restarted in Britain and elsewhere a few weeks later, but it wasn't until October 23 that the FDA allowed the trial to resume in the US after determining that the case was unrelated to the vaccine.AstraZeneca went through another scare when a volunteer in a trial in Brazil died, but it turned out the volunteer had been given a placebo and had died of Covid-19.\"One of the groups that is queued up to get vaccines early are the residents of long term care facilities,\" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who heads the CDC's respiratory diseases and immunizations branch.\"They are getting vaccine early because they're among the most fragile -- 40% of deaths have been in those populations. They are medically fragile,\" Messonnier said in an interview with the Aspen Institute Monday.\"If we vaccinate in a nursing home on Monday, somebody dies on Wednesday, it will be a terrible tragedy. It may, but it's likely not related to the vaccine. So I hope that people will try to not jump to conclusions.\"Such scares are certain to become more common as more and more people get vaccinated. The CDC plans to actively ask people about symptoms using a text-messaging app called V-Safe. At the same time, social media may be filled with stories of people who suffer illnesses or accidents and who link them to the vaccine -- whether they are directly related or not.Drees said her hospital system will be ready to hear of these from workers who get vaccinated and is preparing an education campaign to help deal with it. \"We are very comfortable with the science behind this vaccine,\" she said.Colorado saw a snafu with its very first rehearsal. A test shipment of a vaccine ancillary kit containing syringes, alcohol and other supplies got shipped to another state by mistake. \"This error in shipment was due to a label printing error with the manufacturer. The manufacturer has corrected the problem, but Colorado will not be receiving a second test shipment of the 'mock' ancillary kit,\" the state said in a statement earlier this month.One hospital system in California prepared its staff to receive vaccine in powdered form from Pfizer. Pfizer's vaccine is, in fact, shipped as a frozen fluid that must be diluted.\"One of the challenges that has not gotten a lot of attention is that we have not factored in space in our timeline to do a lot of hands-on training with the people who will be administering these vaccines,\" said Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition, which is supporting frontline workers who will administer Covid-19 vaccinations.Such mistakes can make for a rough rollout, said Mike Osterholm, head of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and an adviser to President-elect Joe Biden's transition team.\"Having a vaccine means nothing if it doesn't result in a vaccination. For that to happen, the vaccine has to travel the last mile to arrive on time, at the right temperature and where it will end up in the arm of the intended vaccinee,\" Osterholm said.There are many opportunities for mistakes to be made, Kayyem said.\"Any supply chain in which demand exceeds supply is going to be complicated because you are making allocation decisions all the time. You are making them across a country that is geographically dispersed, that is divided, and that is in the middle of a pandemic,\" Kayyem said.Vaccines that must be kept frozen at ultra-cold temperatures may thaw out and have to be thrown away. Vaccines may get sent to the wrong destination. A nurse may vigorously shake a precious vial of Pfizer vaccine -- the package insert says that can ruin it, and instead says the vial should be inverted gently a few times to mix the contents. People will forget to come back for their second doses.\"There will be course corrections and someone, sometimes, is just going to do something stupid,\" Kayyem said.", "summary": "The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine is going to be messy, unfair and sometimes scary. People are going to have to deal with it, experts say."},
{"text": "The first coronavirus vaccines are out -- delivered by FedEx and UPS to hospitals across the country and into the arms of health care workers in hospitals in large cities such as New York and Washington, DC.Boxes filled with dry ice and vaccine have been delivered to Kentucky and Louisiana, Michigan and Arizona.It almost sounds as if people will be lining up everywhere before New Year's to get a vaccine. But while millions of health care workers and residents of nursing homes may get immunized against the virus before the end of the year, the rest of the population is going to have to wait for months.Healthy adults under the age of 65 and children may well have to wait until late spring or even the summer, depending on how many vaccines get approved, how quickly they can be manufactured and distributed, and how the debate goes over allocation.Here's a look at what to expect from the coming coronavirus vaccination campaign.December is a month for some big decisions. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices has voted to recommend that 21 million frontline health care workers and support staff and 3 million residents of long-term care facilities who have been hardest hit by the pandemic be in the first group.It will be easiest to vaccinate these groups -- they're already in institutional settings and the nursing home residents can get vaccinated at the same time their caregivers are being immunized.This decision is being made even before the US Food and Drug Administration has authorized a vaccine. The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its vaccine advisers -- the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee -- for December 10 to consider emergency use authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine, and another meeting on December 17 to discuss Moderna's vaccine.The FDA has promised to consider the committee's advice before deciding on any vaccine. The committee is made up of outside experts who do not have a stake in any of the companies making coronavirus vaccines and who are independent of the federal government.FDA officials say their decisions on the vaccines could come days to weeks after the meetings -- it depends on what questions come up.But in the fastest scenario, the FDA could give emergency use authorization (EUA) as soon as next week for Pfizer's vaccine, and the federal government's Operation Warp Speed has promised to start delivering vaccines within 24 hours after that.Potentially, the same thing could happen the following week with Moderna's vaccine.Pfizer and Moderna started making vaccine even while they were still testing it and between them plan to have 40 million doses for the US market by the end of December. Each vaccine needs two doses, given three to four weeks apart.But it's not all ready to go. \"To give you a sense of numbers: The first week's allocations for the two vaccines with data submitted to the FDA are approximately 6.4 million doses of Pfizer and 12.5 million doses of Moderna,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said December 3. \"We'll send half of those doses initially to ensure that the second dose requirements are available, 21 and 28 days later.\"If two or more vaccines get approved by the FDA, January might be when discussion really starts on who can get vaccinated and when. Dr. Larry Corey of the University of Washington, who is heading up coronavirus vaccine clinical trials in the US, has said if both Pfizer and Modern get vaccines authorized, they could supply 50 million more doses in January and 60 million more in February and March.That adds up to 150 million doses -- enough to fully vaccinate 75 million people. But there are way more people than that just in the groups tagged as priority groups in the US. The CDC estimates there are 21 million health care personnel, 3 million long-term care residents, 87 million essential workers, 100 million adults with high risk medical conditions and 53 million others 65 and older. Several groups of independent experts have weighed in on how to allocate vaccines, including the and.They've all laid out basic principles that include protecting the country's health care system, protecting the most vulnerable people, controlling the spread of the virus and being equitable across society.ACIP will need to meet to decide on the details off all these phases.January might include some of the rest of Phase 1 of a Phase 1b is roughed out to include essential workers, including emergency medical technicians, as well as frontline workers at very high risk of infection, such as food workers. This phase may also include older adults living in congregate settings or crowded conditions. There's a also a proposed Phase 1c, which might include people of all ages with underlying conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease who are at significantly higher risk of dying or getting severely ill from Covid-19. By February, states may have hit their stride on vaccinating residents. Vaccination campaigns may  move beyond hospitals and nursing homes, rehabilitation centers and other such facilities to pharmacies and medical practices.More vaccines may be authorized or at least ready for authorization by January or February. It's clear that Moderna and Pfizer alone cannot cover the US population. AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax all have vaccines in Phase 3 trials, the last stage before seeking authorization or approval.AstraZeneca is likely to seek US approval by January. Johnson & Johnson has said it will have efficacy data by January or February. Novavax is a little farther behind, but all of these companies will also be producing vaccines while testing goes on and might be adding to the count.It's possible that the US will still be in Phase 1 of vaccination in March, simply because of the sheer numbers involved. Anyone healthy and under 65 who is not an essential or high-risk worker would not be thinking about vaccination yet.If more vaccines have been approved and brought online, it's possible Phase 2 of vaccination could begin by now. This group has not been decided yet, but Phase 2 might include K-12 teachers and staff and other child care workers, as well as other critical workers such as retail workers and transportation workers. This group could also include people in homeless shelters and all people over 65 who were not already included in phase 1.April is the beginning of the second quarter of the year and CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told the Senate in August he did not think the general public would be able to get vaccinated until the \"late second quarter, third quarter 2021.\"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has a rosier forecast.\"I had been saying by my calculation, sometime by the end of March, the beginning of April that the normal healthy man and woman in the street, who has no underlying conditions, would likely get it,\" Fauci told MSNBC on December 14, the day the first vaccines rolled out.Fauci said that by the second quarter of 2021, the US could see the \"overwhelming majority of the population vaccinated.\" Young adults and children would have to wait until Phase 3 and under other scenarios that's likely to be May at the soonest -- perhaps June or later, depending on what ACIP decides, what the vaccine supply looks like and how smoothly distribution is going.The federal government has promised that any coronavirus vaccine will be provided free of charge to the American public. That would be very unlikely to change under a Biden administration. The federal government has paid $7.76 billion upfront to four companies alone for their vaccines; Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Novavax, and tens of millions more upfront or in options to three other companies to guarantee they can develop coronavirus vaccines.\"We've paid for the vaccines, we paid for the shipping costs, and the administration costs ... will be covered by healthcare payers, private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and our program to cover Covid-19 expenses for the uninsured,\" Azar said December 3.Hospital and health care workers will get the vaccine at their workplaces. They're already set up to deliver vaccines. So will nursing home and long-term care facility residents and, when the time comes, residents of other congregate facilities such as assisted living and senior living homes. Pharmacy chains and big-box stores are also gearing up to deliver vaccines -- think any place people normally get flu shots, including grocery store pharmacies and, of course, physician offices. School clinics may also be considered, especially in states where community clinics have been installed in schools.People who have tested out the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have reported they can sometimes have a kick -- causing soreness at the injection site and maybe a feeling of general malaise for a day or so. Vaccine experts say that's a sign the vaccine is working, causing the immune system to rev up and generate a response. There's not much information about the other vaccines but AstraZeneca, after two scares, says it has recorded no serious side-effects among its volunteers. The FDA and companies will have extensive systems for reporting side-effects.But none of the vaccines being tested for the US market uses even a piece of the real coronavirus, so there is no way they could give you a coronavirus infection. At first there will be little choice -- both Pfizer and Moderna are providing a new type of immunization called an mRNA vaccine. It's considered especially safe because it does not use a whole virus -- just a piece of genetic material -- and both seem especially effective, providing 95% protection against symptomatic disease.What's not known is how long that protection might last, whether either vaccine protects against asymptomatic disease and whether either stops people from spreading the virus to others.Vaccines coming later might offer harder choices. AstraZeneca's vaccine uses what's called a replication deficient virus to deliver a piece of genetic material from the coronavirus. So does Johnson & Johnson's vaccine. There's not a lot of safety data about these vaccines yet, and no evidence the viral vectors could be harmful. Nonetheless, some doctors may be reluctant to offer them to patients with compromised immune systems, including those with rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis who are taking immune-suppressing drugs; pregnant women; people taking certain cancer treatments and others.All these plans assume the states, which are in charge of distributing vaccines, get some money to do it.

But other men who have sex with men (MSM) will still need to refrain from sex for three months before donating.Rules preventing gay and bisexual men from blood donation were implemented in many countries in the wake of the AIDS crisis, with health agencies arguing that they were more likely than other people to acquire infections through sex.But LGBTQ campaigners and other groups have opposed the bans, warning that they perpetuate stereotypes about gay and bisexual men and contending that with modern screening methods, the risk of missing an infection is small.The UK change, which came after an advisory board made recommendations to the government, will see each prospective donor judged on an individual basis. \"This is a positive step and recognises individuals for the actions they take, rather than their sexual preference,\" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.The move was received positively by LGBTQ charities, but many pressed for further changes to allow more gay and bisexual men to make potentially lifesaving donations.\"This change will help ensure more gay and bi men can donate blood, and represents an important first step towards a donation selection policy entirely based on an individualised assessment of risk,\" Nancy Kelley, chief executive of the LGBTQ rights group Stonewall, said in a statement.  \"While we welcome today's news, we know much more still needs to be done to tackle the challenges that lead to gay and bi men, along with other groups of people including black African communities, sex workers, and trans communities, being at higher risk of acquiring HIV and other STIs,\" she added.In the 1980s, Britain implemented a total ban on blood donation for any man who had ever had sex with another man. In 2011 it was scrapped in favor of a one-year deferral period in which a gay or bisexual donor must refrain from sex, and in 2017 that period was reduced to three months.A number of countries including Croatia, Malaysia, Singapore and Ukraine still have universal bans in place, Reuters reported, while others including Italy and Spain have no restrictions at all.The United States made MSM wait one year after having sex before they could give blood, but it  the period to three months in April, given an increased need for donations as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The American Red Cross is among the organizations that has opposed the rules, saying on its website that \"blood donation eligibility should not be determined by methods that are based upon sexual orientation.\"British blood donors must answer a series of questions about their lifestyle and sexual history before donation, which will remain in place under the new approach. As well as questions for male donors, female donors are also asked whether they have had sex with a man who has ever also had sex with another man.The UK's NHS Blood and Transplant Service said it was \"very pleased\" at the change, and several lawmakers welcomed the move.\"Such a contrast to the attitude I met campaigning at the Department of Health many years back when someone said 'gays can't be trusted to tell the truth about their sex lives,'\" Michael Fabricant, a lawmaker with the governing Conservative party, tweeted.", "summary": "The UK will allow some sexually active gay and bisexual men to donate blood, overturning a ban that originated during the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and has been decried as homophobic for years."},

Shipments of the vaccine are expected to arrive in all 50 states on Monday, with more on the way. It's a monumental moment and achievement, given the new . But the pandemic isn't over yet. Here are three things you shouldn't do until things are under control. First things first: It will be months before most people can receive the vaccine, so be patient and don't rush out to your doctor's office or pharmacy in hopes of getting one right away. It's up to states to allocate their share of vaccines, but the CDC has recommended that frontline health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities get the vaccine first. Other high-priority groups include essential workers, emergency personnel and those with underlying health conditions that put them at a higher risk of complications or death.For the next several months, the focus will be on vaccinating these individuals, , director of the , told CNN last week. And it will likely be the spring when the vaccine becomes more widely available. \"I would project by the time you get to April, it will be ... 'open season,' in the sense of anyone, even the non-high-priority groups, could get vaccinated,\" Fauci said.Pointing to the other vaccine candidates in clinical trials and under FDA review,  told Axios last week there will be enough vaccines for any American who wants one by the end of the second quarter of 2021.\"We want to make this eventually so it's as much like getting your flu vaccine as possible,\" he said.Jan Malcolm, commissioner of the , told CNN she thinks it's a \"great idea\" for people to call their doctor's office to find out what their plan might be for administering vaccines, but that information may not be readily available just yet. \"Much more information is going to be coming in the near future about how people will be able to access those vaccines when they're more broadly available, but frankly, that's probably a month or more off,\" Malcolm added.  In the meantime, if receiving a new vaccine gives you pause, you should read up on it. The vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective, but Moncef Slaoui, the head of the federal government's  vaccine initiative, told \"Fox News Sunday\"that he was concerned about the level of vaccine hesitancy. \"We hope that now that all the data is out and available to be discussed in detail that people will keep their mind open, to listen to the data,\" Slaoui said, \"and hopefully agree that this is a very effective and safe vaccine, and therefore take it.\" Masks will continue to be , even as shots go into arms.Dr. Sandro Cinti, an infectious disease specialist and medical professor at the University of Michigan, explained that it remains unclear whether people vaccinated against the virus can still infect someone else.The trials only tracked Covid-19 in people who were showing symptoms. But according to the CDC, about 40% of cases are in people who show no symptoms.\"You have to wear your mask,\" he said. \"What they didn't look at was if you get the vaccine and you're protected, can you still get some virus that then goes in your nose and then infect somebody else.\"Fauci echoed that message while speaking to CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Anderson Cooper during last week. Even if you get vaccinated in January or February, he said, \"There may be half the country that is still not vaccinated, which means there is a lot of virus floating around there.\" \"And even if you are vaccinated, you may be protected against getting sick, but you may not be protected from infection,\" he said.It's possible that vaccinated individuals could still pick up the virus. While it may not make them sick, they could still spread it to someone else through a cough or sneeze. \"The more and more people that get vaccinated, the less and less the threat is,\" Fauci said. \"Whether you get to the point if you have an overwhelming majority of people vaccinated and you have a good umbrella of herd immunity, you can get back to as close to normal as you want.\" Throughout the pandemic, social distancing has gone hand in hand with masks, and that doesn't change now. Both will still be necessary, even after receiving the vaccine, the CDC said Saturday. No vaccine is 100% effective and protection is not immediate, CDC Dr. Sarah Mbaeyi said in a meeting Saturday with the agency's vaccine advisory committee. Pfizer's vaccine requires two doses administered three weeks apart to reach 95% efficacy, and it will take one to two weeks after the second dose for a person to be considered \"fully vaccinated.\" \"Given the currently limited information on how well the vaccine works in the general population; how much it may reduce disease, severity or transmission; and how long protection lasts, vaccinated persons should continue to follow all current guidance to protect themselves and others,\" Mbaeyi said, including masking, social distancing and washing hands.Sadly, for many Americans, continuing to social distance may mean not gathering with their loved ones for the holidays.Even Fauci has said that while he wants to see his three daughters, his family will not gather for Christmas for the first time in 30 years. In an interview hosted by the Milken Institute last week, Fauci told CBS' Norah O'Donnell that even modest gatherings of families and friends were driving the ongoing surge of Covid-19. \"We're starting to see infections that are emerging from what otherwise seem like benign settings,\" he said, expressing concern about the potential for spread over the holidays.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti urged residents to stay home for the holidays and adhere to California's regional stay-at-home order, pointing to a surge in cases that followed Thanksgiving gatherings. \"We have to make sure there's not a Christmas and holiday surge on top of that,\" he said. \"That's in our hands to stop these numbers from climbing, these (hospital) beds from disappearing, and these lives from being ended.\" North Carolina  in a written statement, asking North Carolinians to have virtual gatherings this holiday season. \"As tough as this is, especially at the holidays, the sacrifices we're making now will ensure that our loved ones can gather again at next year's Thanksgiving and Christmas tables,\" he wrote.", "summary": "The country's first Covid-19 vaccines could be administered as soon as Monday, after the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine received green lights from the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

{"text": "You are living in an extraordinary time. So much is happening in the world, in your country, in your life. Making sense of it, processing, coping and even harnessing it to your benefit is important work. And writing in a personal journal is one of the most enjoyable, creative, simple and productive ways to accomplish those things.Before we delve into the wellness benefits and creative options for your new or renewed journaling, here are my own bona fides: Encouraged by a middle school reading teacher (thank you, Ms. Gearhart, wherever you are), I started a journal in 1986 that I've kept up with ever since. It's the most consistent, contiguous activity of my life besides eating, reading and watching television and movies. It's the closest I get to Malcom Gladwell's 10,000 practice hours toward skill mastery, as explained in his book \"Outliers.\" By my interpretation of Gladwell's formula, I'm a journaling expert.\"Now\" is usually the best time to start anything. The sooner you begin, the sooner you'll benefit. As for journaling, it takes little initial preparation and effort to get started. You're reading this article and already thinking about writing, so let's do it! Also, consider the historical context of starting or restarting now. We are in the middle of a global pandemic with massive economic, political, cultural and personal implications. To journal now is to record history, as witnessed through your own lens. And that's exactly the kind of documentation that helps individuals and society make sense of events. \"Only if we succeed in bringing this simple, daily material together,\" as the late Dutch Minister of Education Gerrit Bolkestein said,explaining the need to preserve diaries and letters during World War II, \"only then will the scene of this struggle for freedom be painted in full depth and shine.\"A journal or diary is also your personal history. You may not be eager to revisit this strange and challenging chapter anytime soon, but at some point in the future, your current thoughts, activities, worries and other such details will become fascinating. Journaling is a great memory aide. \"The palest ink is clearer than the fondest memory,\" goes the Chinese proverb.It's never too late either. Start now and record reflections of the last eight months while they're still fresh and unfolding.While research specifically on long-term journaling or keeping a diary is lacking, there are mental, physical and practical benefits to writing about what upsets us and what makes us happy, according to studies and experts (other than myself).Therapy is beneficial to everyone, no matter what you're coping with or working through. Whether you're getting professional help or not, writing about it is also a highly effective — and extremely cost-effective — mental health tool.Writing out our worries and problems helps us work through them. The act of reflection creates perspective, and articulating an issue is the first step in solving it. Through the safe and private act of writing, we can better understand our fears and even trauma, which helps ease the grip they hold on us. On the flip side, reflecting on what you're grateful for is .James Pennebaker, a psychologist, researcher and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, has studied the benefits of personal, reflective writing for decades. In his numerous studies on \"expressive writing\" -- focused on writing about an upsetting or traumatic event -- he has found it to be a \"free, simple and efficient system to work through issues that are keeping you awake at night,\" he explained to me. \"Expressive writing works for a number of reasons,\" Pennebaker said. First, just acknowledging an upsetting event has value. \"And writing about it also helps the person find meaning or understand it.\" If you don't find meaning, he said, \"you may be constantly thinking about it.\"\"Once you work through it and are not thinking about it, you sleep better,\" Pennebaker said, and . \"Social relationships improve\" as well, he added, probably because you can more easily focus on others and their issues. In one study by Pennebaker, students who employed expressive writing about traumatic events had . In another, those who recently lost their jobs and wrote out their feelings about it  than those who didn't. Expressive and reflective writing has been associated with a host of benefits, including ,  and improving  for some couples. Writing about a positive experience can , and personal writing has been shown to  for some. No wonder the  recommends journaling for its soldiers.How the act of writing impacts your brain is still being unraveled, but cognitive scientists now know our brains can only process certain information by writing it down. Writing down thoughts is akin to someone with a disability using a ramp to more easily enter a building, explained Andy Clark, a philosopher and cognitive scientist at the University of Edinburgh, in a 2018 New Yorker .Having written in a journal for decades now I have found that it:\"For human beings, life is meaningful because it is a story,\" wrote Atul Guwande in his book \"Being Mortal.\" \"Unlike your experiencing self -- which is absorbed in the moment -- your remembering self is attempting to recognize not only the peaks of joy and valleys of misery but also how the story works out as a whole.\"This couldn't be easier. All you need is a pen and notebook or a computer, and some time.Beyond that, there is no right way to write. Structure, frequency and subject matter is your choice and will evolve over time. Anything you write -- from a free flow of ideas to a rigid template of topics -- is valuable.If that's too much creative freedom, I do have some \"expert\" advice of my own that may spark ideas for you. The first question is whether you want it to be diary-style, where you try to write every day. Traditional diaries record things that happened, and not necessarily how you feel about them. A journal is typically less frequent and more about the interior life, as impacted by events. Frequency doesn't really matter but setting a daily, weekly or monthly goal may help you get in a groove. I personally average about one or two entries a month -- but they tend to be long, written over multiple days (and multiple pre-pandemic visits to favorite coffee shops). However frequent, you should date each entry.Over the years my journaling has evolved. Every entry now ends with a famous or found quote that sums up some part of my current condition. I also have categories I repeat, including short summaries of books I've read, coffee shop reviews, New Year's resolutions, , the likes and dislikes of my kids at certain stages, and plans for the future.I prefer physical books to electronic entries, but that's simply a personal choice. Both mediums carry a risk of accidently losing them. (I once left a journal on a plane; luckily the crew found it a couple of tense hours later.) And the health benefits described above don't seem to be dependent on a medium, Pennebaker said. \"There's basically no difference,\" he said, between writing on paper versus electronic. \"All of it is the art of translating experience into words.\"But social media -- even if that's where you currently and regularly spill your emotions and record the details of your life -- is riskier. It can be beneficial according to some new research, Pennebaker explained, but only if the feedback is positive. He said it's like talking to a friend. The friend's reaction and feedback can be good and helpful or negative and unhelpful. Journaling, on the other hand, is a private space where you can safely be open and honest in a way that may be risky in a public space like social media.\"In the journal I do not just express myself more openly than I could do to any person,\" wrote Susan Sontag, \"I create myself.\" I'm on my 34th book since I started journaling in eighth grade. I use the same black pen throughout a single volume (currently a Uniball Signo 207). I try to break up pages of text with sketches, lists, hand-drawn charts and the occasional poignant yet hilarious New Yorker cartoon. About 10 years ago, I started adding a diary calendar feature to record at least one thing that happened every day -- the profound and the mundane -- so that I captured both the forest and the trees that make up the map of my life.Some people have journals that favor art and sketches over words. Then there are the trendy goal-focused bullet journals in which you record your personal history in a series of lists and charts. See what appeals to you and don't be afraid to shift and evolve.If you go the traditional physical books route, avoid the cheap spiral-bound notebooks I used when I started, and look for bound volumes that appeal to your aesthetics. They will  and have a longer shelf life. Over time I've gravitated from lined pages to blank sketch books, typically hard cover. I now pick volumes based on durability, size, number of sheets, paper stock and the cover. My favorites are, in order:  (7\" x 9\", 192 pages, 90 gsm stock weight),  (5\" x 8\", 192 pages, 90 gsm) and  (5.75\" x 8.25\", 249 pages, 80 gsm). These are the sacred safe spaces where I do my \"denken mit der hand\" (\"thinking by hand\"), as the promotional copy of the Leuchturrm 1917 describes its use.I like pockets in the back, bookmark ribbons and elastic bands, but those aren't musts for me. Often, I know a good journal by holding it and flipping through, imagining myself writing in it. And when I imagine writing in it, it's usually in a coffee shop with a creamy cortado and a warm pastry. I also love writing on planes and trains,  and early in the morning before anyone else wakes up. But just try to write wherever you can carve out time to yourself and your thoughts.Again, you make up the rules, if any, and break them when you want to. The important thing is to start — and to enjoy yourself. The structure will change as you do, but benefits will come right away.

{"text": "The holidays are often a time when the goal of saving money is in opposition with showing people love in the grandest of ways. Reining in holiday spending may be the absolute last thing people want to do, but during pandemic-related financial struggles, scaling back is a necessity. In the first week of December,  filed for unemployment benefits. The incomes of some others, worldwide, have taken a hit, meaning that some may be sitting out this holiday season — but there are ways to have a budget-friendly Christmas without breaking the bank. \"People really have to keep it in perspective,\" said Tawra Kellam, one of the bloggers behind the blog . \"It's about celebrating with family. It's about taking time off work and having fun together. And even doing little things for Christmas can make it special.\" With the following tips on how to enjoy Christmas decorations, gifts, meals and activities for little to no cost, this Christmas can be undoubtedly unique but rich with meaning and joy. The main concepts are seeing what you have with new eyes, thinking outside the box and learning how to find the best deals. The safest way to shop this year is online but if you do need to go out, planning where you need to go, going in one trip and wearing masks is best. Having a festive home is a seasonal mood booster but especially this year, and repurposing items around your house as decorations is one way to start. \"If you can only do something small to make it special, that's enough,\" said Melissa Riker, the creator of . \"It's the little things that are fairly easy and inexpensive to do that can add that special touch.\"  If you don't have old decorations, try deciding on a color theme then perusing your house for anything in those colors. \"You might not think about them as they're scattered through the house,\" Riker said, \"but if you bring them all together — put them on your mantel or add them to the centerpiece of your coffee table — you can really make a beautiful layout.\" That's using creativity instead of money, said Jodie Kammerer and Julie Lancia, the creators of . If you're not the creative type, video chat your stylish friends so they can scan your rooms and intuit what you could use. You may also find inspiration from what social media users share under the hashtags  and . You can shop from nature in your backyard, neighborhood, park or on a hike.\"Clip some pine needles or pine branches,\" Riker said. \"Even just plain branches without leaves can look really pretty if you put glitter on them and they look like ice branches.\" Out of garden herbs, pine cones, mistletoe and holly, flowers and bush or tree clippings, you could make a table arrangement, wreath or garlandAt stores selling Christmas trees, \"ask for the clippings that they throw away,\" Lancia said. With a bow or burlap tied around it, \"it's immediately a Christmas decoration.\" Take advantage of sales and coupons at craft stores, vintage stores, thrift stores and dollar sections, which likely have inexpensive decorations in bulk, DIY projects and boxes of 12 candy canes for $1. \"I have decorated entire trees just with things from different dollar stores,\" Riker said. \"They have actually a lot of decorations that, when you combine them all together, can look really high-end.\"Instead of buying Christmas ribbons, you could purchase fabric and cut it into strips, using that to form your ribbons instead. And \"if you're putting ribbon on a Christmas tree, you don't need to have a whole spool to wrap around it,\" Riker said. \"You can take shorter strands and tuck it in so it looks like it's weaving in and out of the tree.\" A strand of twinkle lights may be all you need to make a space look festive, Kammerer said. If you have children, make the preparation more fun by getting \"your little elves to work,\" Lancia said. They can craft paper chains and snowflakes, garlands out of cranberries and popcorn and .For a Christmas tree, look for discounts at craft stores, grocery stores, tree farms or hardware stores. Pre-lit trees may be less expensive than buying trees and lights separately. And don't think that you have to use ornaments.\"One of my favorite things is a natural element tree,\" Lancia said. \"You've gathered your pine cones at the park. Now you're going to spray paint them a glittery silver\" and put them on the tree, in a bowl or on your table or mantel.  If you have a printer, look online for freeprintable decorations. \"That is a really, really easy way to change up your decor without spending any money at all,\" Riker said.Gift giving can be monetarily stressful if that's how you want to cheer people after a tough year, but frugal alternatives could show that appreciation, too. \"Everybody doesn't need a gift; everybody doesn't want a gift,\" said Judy Woodward Bates, \"The Bargainomics Lady\" behind her  and author of \".\" \"Don't get all upset because you can't afford to buy gifts for everybody, because the purpose of Christmas is just to let each other know how much you care about each other.\" If you're embarrassed about giving less this year, \"Fess up,\" she said. \"You will see the relief on other people's faces, because it just takes one to be willing to say, 'I'm strapped this year.' Because most of these other people, when you just say that, will admit, 'Hey, I'm in the same boat you are. Thank goodness you had the courage to speak up because I wanted to say it, but I was just afraid of how people would react.' \" Gift giving can get more complicated when you realize you'll need wrapping materials, too — but by having realistic expectations and thinking outside the box, you can wrap gifts in creative and attractive ways, Kellam said. You can: With a few tips and tricks, you can still have a fancy feast this season.  instead of buying prepared foods is one way to reduce costs. Some grocery stores have seasonal donation programs wherein customers buy a prepared bag of nonperishable, traditional holiday foods, which is donated to a food bank where people in need can pick them up. Check around for such programs if you'd like a holiday meal or visit a food bank for food in general.

{"text": "The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday accepted the recommendation of the agency's vaccine advisory committee, clearing the way for Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine to be administered in the US. The news followed Saturday's vote by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to recommend the vaccine for people ages 16 and older. That came after the US Food and Drug Administration had authorized the vaccine for emergency use on Friday. Here's what we know about the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. Now that CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield has accepted the ACIP's recommendation, vaccinations can begin. This CDC advisory group had previously recommended that health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be the first to receive a vaccine when it receives EUA. The , so states will  the vaccine first.Both groups are \"exceptionally high risk,\" , chair of the ACIP, which voted earlier this month to recommend those groups be included in what it called Phase 1a of its distribution plan.Keeping doctors and nurses healthy will be important for the continuing fight against the virus, which will stretch on for months, even after a vaccine is authorized. But Romero said that first group includes other people working in health care institutions, like those who deliver food and perform housekeeping.\"Anybody that works within a health care institution that could have contact with an individual who has Covid should receive vaccination,\" Romero previously told CNN.Residents of long-term care facilities like nursing homes also need the protection. So far, they account for about 40% of coronavirus deaths in the US.Army Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of the federal government vaccine initiative Operation Warp Speed, previously said he believed vaccine administration will be able to begin vaccinations within 96 hours of authorization.CVS, which is preparing to begin vaccinations in long-term care facilities, said that December 21 would be the earliest vaccine administration can start in the facilities.\"We'll be in facilities that day in states that choose to begin as soon as possible,\" spokesman Ethan Slavin said.The FDA is set to make a decision on a separate vaccine candidate by Moderna in the coming days. If it's also authorized, it's possible that 20 million people could get vaccinated in the next several weeks, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told CNN on Wednesday.The CDC is  to distribute vaccines. Phase 1a would be followed by Phases 1b and 1c, which could include essential workers at high risk of infection, other emergency personnel and people with underlying conditions who are at a higher risk of Covid-19 complications and death.But it will likely be months before the vaccine is widely available to the rest of the population.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday night that the groups receiving the vaccine in December, January, February and March will likely include those in \"high priority groups.\"\"I would project by the time you get to April, it will be ... 'open season,' in the sense of anyone, even the non-high priority groups could get vaccinated,\" Fauci said. In the meantime, it's important that people continue to wear masks and social distance. At this time, the federal government has secured just 100 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine, though .It's important to note, however, that Pfizer's vaccine requires two doses administered several weeks apart to reach 95% efficacy. So 100 million doses would vaccinate half the number of people.Again, not all of those doses will be available at once. Azar said earlier this month that 6.4 million doses of Pfizer vaccine would be allocated for shipment the first week. The initial shipment would include half of the doses, followed by the second half three weeks later.States will be getting shipments of the vaccine once a week to begin with, Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Moncef Slaoui said Friday, and governors will be told a week in advance how many doses they will be getting.The number of doses will increase weekly because manufacturing will ramp up, Slaoui told CNN's Jake Tapper.Slaoui said he believes most doses will be injected within three to four days, but after that, \"I think it will take a week.\"There are a number of vaccines in development by other companies as well. Azar told CNN the US has the ability to purchase up to 3 billion doses of vaccines from six manufacturers, including Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi/GSK and Novavax.Shipping the vaccine will be a daunting task, and the . The first shipments of the vaccine departed a Pfizer plant in Michigan on Sunday morning. A total of 189 boxes of vials are expected to arrive in all 50 states Monday. Another 3,900 vials are expected to ship later Sunday to US territories. Another 400 boxes packed with about 390,000 vials are expected to ship Monday and arrive at their destinations on Tuesday. UPS and FedEx have both said they will help with distribution following authorization. The vaccines will then be flown across the country, and  its air traffic controllers will prioritize flights carrying the vaccines. FedEx and UPS will be involved in transporting the vaccines on the ground, delivering them to facilities where they will be administered, like hospitals and long-term care facilities.But Pfizer's vaccine , making the logistics of delivery even more complicated. The vaccine will be shipped in special containers packed with dry ice. Upon arrival at their destination, the vaccines will then be stored in ultra-cold freezers at minus 70 degrees Celsius, or 94 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. Pfizer's clinical trials have shown no severe side effects. According to a briefing document released by the FDA's vaccine advisory committee, the most common side effects were reactions at the point of injection on the body, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever. Severe adverse reactions occurred in less than 4.6% of trial participants and were less frequent in older adults compared to younger participants. , where the vaccine roll out began earlier this week, said Wednesday that people with \"significant history of allergic reactions\" should not receive the vaccine.

Dr. Peter Szilagyi, a pediatrician at the University of California Los Angeles and a member of the CDC's advisory committee, said he voted in favor of the vaccine \"because of the clear evidence of its efficacy/safety profile and benefit/risk profile, based on our evidence and policy framework.\"\"I know we're going to have very tough and hard times ahead because of the surge and a limited vaccine supply,\" Szilagyi said immediately following the committee's vote. \"But I am really hopeful that this is the beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic.\"The emergency use authorization (EUA) is a \"significant milestone,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement Friday. He said it comes after an \"open and transparent review process that included input from independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough evaluation by the agency's career scientists.\"An EUA stops short of a full approval. Pfizer would have to file a separate application for its vaccine to be fully licensed by the FDA.But the EUA \"holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.Once the vaccines leave Pfizer's Kalamazoo facility, they'll be bound for 636 locations across the country, Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of the federal government's vaccine initiative Operation Warp Speed, said in a news conference Saturday. \"We expect 145 sites across all the states to receive the vaccine on Monday, another 425 sites on Tuesday, and the final 66 sites on Wednesday, which will complete the initial delivery of the Pfizer orders for the vaccine,\" Perna added. But it will be months before most Americans will get one. Advisers to the CDC have recommended  be first in line., Hahn praised FDA scientists working around the clock to review the vaccine. \"I will absolutely take this Covid-19 vaccine pending availability and distribution,\" he said, \"because I have complete trust and confidence in the FDA's career staff's evaluation.\" \"Science and data guided the FDA's decision,\" he said.That said, the FDA's \"work evaluating the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine does not end with this authorization,\" Hahn told reporters. Additional review is needed, and a full approval is not expected for months.  Of course, Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine is just one of those in development. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told ABC News on Friday that about 20 million Americans should be vaccinated by the end of the month, 50 million by the end of January and at least 100 million people should be vaccinated by the end of February. Officials \"remain confident,\" he added, that there will be enough doses for any American who wants to get vaccinated by summertime. In the meantime, the US -- ravaged by a rampant spread of the virus -- is projected to face brutal days ahead, and precautions like masking and social distancing will remain crucial. \"We are having this mass casualty event every day here in the US,\" CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen told CNN's Chris Cuomo moments after the FDA'sauthorization was announced Friday evening. \"But now we have this vaccine developed in record time that can, in time, really save us and save our country and save the world from this awful pandemic.\" \"This is  for us,\" added Wen, an emergency medicine physician.The average of  daily cases over the last week was 210,764, another pandemic high, according to a CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins data. of Thanksgiving gatherings and travel -- which officials predicted would lead to even more infections and drive another surge. And that surge could be followed by another surge tied to the upcoming Christmas holiday, some officials have said.Hospitals in nearly every corner of the country have felt the impact. HHS data shows more than 85% of hospitals nationwide had more Covid-19 patients last week than they did a month ago and overall, about one in five hospital inpatients were confirmed to have Covid-19 last week -- nearly double from a month earlier.In the country's 10 largest cities, the share of hospital patients who had the virus ranged from about 9% in New York to 23% in Chicago. Meanwhile in El Paso, Texas, more than 50% of patients in city hospitals had Covid-19 between November 27 and December 3. That's nearly double the national average for that period.As of Saturday, there were more than 13,000 Covid-19 patients in California hospitals, a record for the state and a 3.5% increase compared to the day before, according to the California Department of Public Health. The state also reported a record 35,729 new cases.As of Friday, the average number of daily deaths over the previous seven days was 2,359,  the highest since the pandemic began.The next three months will be \"really rough,\" CDC's director warned, even with a vaccine becoming available soon.\"For the next 60 to 90 days, we're going to have more deaths per day than we had in 9/11,\" Dr. Robert Redfield said Thursday. \"This is going to be a real unfortunate loss of life, as all that we've had so far.\"And it's a reality that a vaccine authorization won't impact, he added.Los Angeles County Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer gave a grim warning about the coming weeks, after announcing Friday that the county has doubled its number of new cases in about 10 days.\"The issue right now is what we call the Thanksgiving surge,\" Ferrer said. \"We had a surge, and now we have a surge on top of a surge, and it's really hard for us to calculate exactly what we're going to see in the next week or two.\"\"We're on a very dangerous track to see unprecedented and catastrophic suffering and death here in L.A. County if we can't stop the surge,\" Ferrer said.Pfizer's vaccine requires two doses administered several weeks apart to reach 95% efficacy, with no severe side effects seen in clinical trials. According to an FDA briefing document, however, \"there are currently insufficient data to make conclusions about the safety of the vaccine in subpopulations such as children less than 16 years, of age, pregnant and lactating individuals, and immunocompromised individuals.\" On Saturday, the FDA's Dr. Marks said decisions about whether pregnant women should take the vaccine should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\"Covid-19 is not a good thing, so someone might decide that they would like to be vaccinated, but that's not something that we're recommending at this time,\" Marks said. \"That's something we're leaving up to the individual.\" Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration has urged airports nationwide to be ready for flights carrying the Covid-19 vaccine even if the airport is not scheduled to receive it. The agency told CNN Thursday it would direct air traffic controllers to give priority clearance to flights carrying the vaccine. States will receive shipments of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine once a week to begin with after the shots are rolled out, said Moncef Slaoui, the chief science adviser of Operation Warp Speed.\"The plan is to ship vaccines once a week and to inform the governors a week in advance about the number of doses they will be receiving,\" Slaoui told CNN. \"Those vaccines ... are meant to be used in full in the population during that period of a week because the same states will receive an identical number of doses in the case of Pfizer's vaccine three weeks later to give as a second dose to give to the recipients of the first dose earlier,\" he said.The number of vaccines will increase \"week on week,\" he added, as manufacturing ramps up. And if the vaccine under development by Moderna is authorized, he said, \"that would be quite a significant boost of vaccine to be distributed.\" Vaccine advisers to the FDA will meet next week to discuss an EUA for Moderna's vaccine.CNN's Maggie Fox, Haley Brink, Andrea Diaz, Shelby Lin Erdman, Jamie Gumbrecht, Kay Jones, Deidre McPhillips, Pete Muntean, Alta Spells, Greg Wallace and Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.

{"text": "Thousands of vials of the long-awaited Covid-19 vaccine are slated to arrive in all 50 states Monday, as top US health officials express hope that health care workers can begin administering the injections immediately. The news comes after the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine cleared its final hurdle: Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accepted an advisory committee's recommendation Saturday that the vaccine may be given to people 16 and older, meaning it can now be administered in the United States.In a statement issued Sunday, Redfield announced he had accepted the recommendation from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The first vaccinations are \"set to start as early as Monday,\" he said. \"This is the next step in our efforts to protect Americans, reduce the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and help restore some normalcy to our lives and our country,\" he said in a statement.Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, too, said his \"greatest hope and desire\" is that the vaccinations begin Monday. \"My hope, again, is that this happens very expeditiously, hopefully tomorrow,\" Hahn told CNN on Sunday. \"We've seen the vaccines go out. We've seen the press reports of hospitals waiting to vaccinate health care workers and those most vulnerable.\"The decision comes the same day that the first batch of vaccines was loaded onto trucks at a Pfizer plant in Portage, Michigan, and shipped out across the country.Freight trucks carrying about 184,275 vials of vaccine departed the plant, and the combined 189 boxes of vaccine vials are expected to arrive in all 50 states Monday.Another 3,900 vials are expected to ship later Sunday to United States territories, and 400 boxes packed with about 390,000 vials will ship Monday to arrive Tuesday. There are five doses of vaccine per vial, according to Pfizer.The excitement surrounding the shipment even brought out small groups of cheering spectators. At Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the vaccine was loaded onto a FedEx cargo plane, Vicki Royce and her husband gathered outside the facility.\"This is so exciting. This is history!\" Royce said. \"The first vaccines are going out. I'm like crying here.\"From its origin in Michigan, the Pfizer/BioNTech  will arrive to about 600 sites across the US in the coming days.\"It's a very good day for America -- and for the world,\" Moncef Slaoui, head of US coronavirus vaccine efforts, told Fox News Sunday.The  to the vaccine Friday, and the CDC's ACIP voted Saturday to recommend it for people age 16 and older. The  recommended that health care workers and long-term care facility residents be first in line to receive the shot.The US plans to distribute 40 million vaccine doses by year's end, followed by 50 to 80 million doses in January and in February, according to Slaoui.\"All in all, we hope to have immunized 100 million people\" by the end of the first quarter of 2021, Slaoui said on Fox News Sunday.The vaccine arrives at a critical moment for the US. Covid-19 hospitalizations hit record highs for the seventh day in a row Saturday. With the winter holidays still ahead, experts warn that the pandemic could continue to get worse before the larger public receives the vaccination.Experts including Hahn and members of the CDC's ACIP have said they have faith in the evaluation of the vaccine.\"I do believe that the process that we have used here in the ACIP to reach this decision is transparent, is science based, keeps equity in mind and is, for this moment, the absolute best that we can do,\" said ACIP member Dr. Beth Bell, a clinical professor of global health at the University of Washington.American Medical Association President Dr. Susan Bailey said in a statement Saturday the biggest obstacle to the vaccine is people's willingness to be vaccinated.\"To be clear, these vaccines will reduce death and severe illness. They have been rigorously evaluated, and if enough of us roll up our sleeves and get vaccinated, we can eventually reclaim normalcy,\" she said.Most Americans will have to wait months before they can get the vaccine, and until then many states are expected to continue experiencing unprecedented numbers of new infections.For the 12th consecutive day, there were more than 100,000 Covid-19 patients in US Hospitals, , with a record 109,331 patients on Sunday. Arizona reported its second highest number of new cases Saturday with 8,076, and reached a new record positivity rate at 25%, indicating that the viral transmission is increasing faster than the case counts indicate, according to an ongoing study by the University of Arizona's Zuckerman College of Public Health. The California Department of Public Health reported 35,729 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, breaking the previous record set on Friday of 35,468 new cases.For three consecutive days, Florida reported more than 10,000 cases a day before reporting 8,964 cases Sunday, a CNN tally shows. The state has reported 7,000 or more new cases every day this month.With the fallout of Thanksgiving travel and gatherings still unfolding, health officials warn the impacts to communities could soon get worse.Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer issued a grim warning about the coming weeks, after announcing Friday that the county has doubled its number of daily new cases in about 10 days.\"The issue right now is what we call the Thanksgiving surge,\" Ferrer said. \"We had a surge, and now we have a surge on top of a surge, and it's really hard for us to calculate exactly what we're going to see in the next week or two.\"\"We're on a very dangerous track to see unprecedented and catastrophic suffering and death here in L.A.
