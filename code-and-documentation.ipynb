            "The release of the court documents and the government briefing that followed shed light on the evidence against Ivins, 62, who died July 29 from an overdose of acetaminophen.

            "\"We are confident, based on the evidence we had, that we could prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt,\" said Jeffrey Taylor, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. \"We are confident that Dr. Ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "Much of the evidence against Ivins is circumstantial, including an e-mail he sent to an associate after the 9/11 terror attacks that contained warnings about terrorists having \"anthrax and sarin gas,\" and having \"decreed death to all Jews and Americans. There was similar language in the letters that were mailed with the deadly powder.\n",

            "The court papers released Wednesday also alleged that Ivins, when asked to provide samples of certain anthrax spores for testing by investigators, tried to mislead agents by providing other types of spores — and then lied about doing so.

Rush Holt, D-N.J., whose district includes a mailbox that was used to send the letters containing anthrax, said that \"while the circumstantial evidence pointing to Dr. Ivins … is compelling, a number of important questions remain unanswered, such as why investigators remained focused on Dr. (Steven) Hatfill long after they had begun to suspect Dr. Ivins … and why investigators are so certain that Ivins acted alone.\"', 'When tainted letters began arriving at news organizations and the Senate offices in mid-September 2001, the FBI initially focused on foreign terrorists.', 'Then investigators began to suspect Hatfill, another Fort Detrick weapons scientist, whom then-attorney general John Ashcroft called \"a person of interest\" in the case.', 'Hatfill was subjected to 24-hour surveillance.', 'The FBI wiretapped his phone and accosted him at job interviews, according to a lawsuit he later filed that accused the government of invading his privacy and ruining his career.', 'In June, Hatfill won a $5.82 million settlement in the case.', 'On Wednesday, Taylor said the government began to consider Ivins as the primary suspect last year.', '\"We thoroughly investigated every other person who could have had access\" to the key flask of anthrax at the Fort Detrick lab, \"and we were able to rule out all but Dr. Ivins,\" Taylor said.', 'The probe found that Ivins had access to a sophisticated machine that could have been used to dry the anthrax spores to make them airborne.', 'In the days before each of the 2001 anthrax mailings, Ivins worked at the lab unusually late into the night and on weekends in the high-security section where the anthrax is stored, the probe found.', 'When questioned by FBI agents, he said he was having trouble at home, the documents say.', 'A few days before the attacks began, the government says, Ivins sent the e-mail that used language similar to that of the anthrax letters.', 'Among the other evidence outlined Wednesday:\\n\\n•Envelopes used in the mailings were available in only a few places, including the Frederick, Md., post office frequented by Ivins.', '•The court documents cited e-mails in which he acknowledged being paranoid and depressed and said he was obsessed with a sorority that has an office near the Princeton, N.J., mailbox used to send some of the anthrax letters.', 'Eventually, the FBI began watching Ivins day and night.', 'He showed \"consciousness of guilt,\" Taylor said.', 'Ivins also told people at his group therapy session that he wanted to kill those who had wronged him, Taylor said.', 'That was on July 9, according an affidavit.', 'Ivins told the social worker and group members that he was a suspect in the anthrax investigation.', '\"He stated … he was angry at investigators, the government and the system in general.', 'He said he was not going to face the death penalty, (and) had a plan to kill co-workers and other individuals,\" the document says.', '\"He said he had a bulletproof vest and a list of co-workers and … was going to obtain a Glock firearm from his son within the next day because federal agents are watching him and he could not obtain a weapon on his own.\"', 'The social worker called the Frederick police, who took him into custody and sent him to a hospital for evaluation.', 'He was later released.', \"'He did some stupid things'\\n\\nEvidence of a potential motive for Ivins to have sent the letters is scant.\", 'Investigators have pointed to trouble at work with a failing anthrax vaccine and a possible cut in his program.', \"The FBI has not said how agents eliminated as suspects others in the lab who also may have had access to Ivins' flask.\", 'The FBI also did not explain why it relied on Ivins to assist their probe even after the 2003 incident in which Ivins gave investigators unsuitable anthrax samples from his lab.', 'And agents have not been able to place Ivins at the Princeton mailbox where the anthrax letters were mailed, but they say he had the time in his work and home schedules to drive there the days the letters were mailed.', \"One of the nation's leading anthrax researchers, Martin Hugh-Jones of Louisiana State University, says the documents leave some critical questions unanswered.\", \"For example, they fail to confirm a genetic match between the strain of anthrax found in Ivins' laboratory and the first victim, Robert Stevens of American Media in Boca Raton, Fla.\", '\"The evidence points at Ivins, but they don\\'t give evidence excluding other people working in the same facility,\" Hugh-Jones says, adding, \"Bruce didn\\'t help himself.', 'He did some very stupid things.\"', 'Geneticist Michael Stebbins of the Federation of American Scientists in Washington, D.C., notes that the science is not very detailed in the affidavit, which the government prepared to obtain approval for a search warrant — not to present its case to a jury.', '\"The four mutations, that alone isn\\'t a smoking gun, but it certainly is compelling evidence that the anthrax came from the flask where Ivins worked,\" he says.', 'Holt, who was briefed Wednesday by FBI Director Robert Mueller, says, \"I hope that as the rest of the information comes out, it will seem more than just another assertion by the FBI that they\\'ve got the right guy.\"', \"'No doubt in my mind'\\n\\nVictims of the anthrax attacks and family members of those who died reacted emotionally at a private briefing by Mueller, said Patrick O'Donnell, a New Jersey postal worker who was infected by the anthrax.\", 'It lasted nearly four hours and included every agent assigned to the case.', '\"A lot of people were breaking up, crying,\" O\\'Donnell said.', 'He found the evidence circumstantial, but solid.', '\"I pretty much have no doubt in my mind he did it now,\" he said.', 'However, he wishes Ivins were alive to stand trial.', '\"It left a lot of doors open.\"', \"Ivins' attorney, Paul Kemp, attended a memorial service for Ivins on Wednesday at Fort Detrick.\", '\"I don\\'t understand how 250 scientists and soldiers, including the base commander and the commanding general, could be here eulogizing Bruce and the FBI seriously consider him a suspect,\" Kemp said via e-mail.', '\"In the words of his commander, he was open, sharing, funny and scientifically brilliant.\"', 'Taylor, though, said the Justice Department is in the process of ending its investigation and plans to formally close the case.', '\"We regret that we will not have the opportunity to

Sullivan Courthouse at 40 Thorndike St.', 'into a home for high-tech offices, along with additional retail and residential space — a project estimated to cost more than $200 million.', 'It would replace most of the gray facade with glass and improve the forbidding ground-level space by adding a small park and more pedestrian access.', 'With demand high for Kendall office space, Leggat McCall executive vice president Robert Dickey said, converting the courthouse will help keep high-tech companies in Cambridge.', '“Our objective .', '.', '.', 'is to attract high-tech tenants, small innovation companies, as well as mature companies, and they don’t have a lot to choose from today,” Dickey said.', 'But nearby residents contend redevelopment of a building that never should have been erected will hurt a neighborhood increasingly leery of the creeping advances of Kendall Square toward their quiet pocket of Cambridge.', 'They are pressuring city officials to reject the special permits Leggat McCall needs to pull off its redevelopment project.', 'The neighbors are also proposing a radical change for the 282-foot-tall building — chopping it down to comply with the area’s 80-foot height limit.', '“The building was a mistake and everybody knows it,” said East Cambridge resident Michael Hawley.', '“It’s rare in life that you get a chance to undo a mistake like this.”\\n\\nSeveral Cambridge city councilors are calling on the state and Leggat McCall to work together to substantially reduce the height, traffic, and environmental impacts of the development.', '“This is a building that probably never should have been built.', 'That is the problem,” said Councilor Dennis Carlone.', 'On one point, all parties agree: The building is ugly.', 'Leggat McCall describes the 1970s-era architecture as Brutalist.', 'When the state built the courthouse it was exempt from local zoning laws, and the 22-story tower soared above neighboring homes.', 'The courthouse is also toxic.', 'It is so shot through with asbestos that Middlesex Superior Court relocated to Woburn in 2008 and Cambridge District Court moved to Medford in 2009.', 'Leggat McCall estimates it will cost at least $30 million to remove the asbestos.', 'As for the county prisoners, they will be moved to the Middlesex House of Correction in Billerica until a new jail and court complex is built.', 'Despite the hurdles, Dickey believes the old building can be turned into a neighborhood asset.', 'As high-tech development pushes out from Kendall Square and the North Point development project progresses on the other side of East Cambridge, he said, the converted building would serve as a link between the two and also aid a neighborhood goal to improve business along Cambridge and First streets.', 'Developer’s vision for 40 Thorndike St.', 'Development in the area already has extended beyond Kendall Square with a series of projects by Alexandria Real Estate, including the recently completed Biogen Idec headquarters on Binney Street.', 'Alexandria is constructing additional office and research space on Binney Street and a residential building at the intersection of Binney and Third streets.', 'A Cambridge Community Development Department report in December identified the US Department of Transportation’s Volpe Research Center at the corner of Broadway and Third Street as a potential site for more office and residential space.', 'But Brian Murphy, Cambridge’s assistant city manager for community development, said Third Street has a different feel farther from Kendall Square.', 'He said the area around the courthouse wasn’t considered in the city’s Kendall Square study.', '“I don’t think we’re looking and saying that Third Street is an area that is really going to be transformed,” Murphy said.', 'The state selected Leggat McCall to redevelop the courthouse after the developer submitted the highest of three bids to purchase the building in late 2012.', 'The price has not been disclosed, but the state Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance expects to close the sale this spring.', 'In addition to facade changes, Leggat McCall plans to convert the upper floors into office space geared toward the types of technology firms associated with Kendall Square.', 'To address neighborhood calls for residential space, the developer has included 24 residential units on the lower floors, and there will be room for retail stores on ground level.', 'But Hawley said the building is “grossly outsized” for its location, and neighbors say converting the facade to glass will create problems with solar glare during the day and light pollution at night.', 'They have launched a website, 40thorndike.org, to publicize their concerns, which also include potential traffic and parking problems.', 'Rhoda Fantasia, who has lived on Third Street for 20 years, said the project has raised residents’ awareness of development pressures facing East Cambridge.', 'Many worry about no longer being able to afford to live in the neighborhood.', '“They have likened what is going on in Kendall Square and now pushing toward North Point, with this 40 Thorndike Street being in the middle, as a malignancy creeping, creeping, creeping,” Fantasia said.', 'Leggat McCall has launched its own website, courb.co/40thorndike, to tout the public benefits of the project, including about $3 million in new tax revenue for the city, the creation of construction jobs for four years, and approximately 1,500 permanent jobs in the building once the work is done.', 'Dickey said Leggat McCall has met with neighbors about its proposal and is willing to talk about the possibility of a height reduction.', '“That will be part of the discussion,” he said.', '“In the end, I don’t know if that makes it a better project or not.”']\n",
