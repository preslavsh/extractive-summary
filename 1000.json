    "text": "By Donna Leinwand, Ken Dilanian, Steve Sternberg and Dan Vergano, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u0097 On several nights before the anthrax attacks in September and October 2001, bioweapons scientist Bruce Ivins repeatedly spent long periods alone in a secure laboratory that housed a strain of the lethal bacteria. He later \"could provide no legitimate reason\" for his after-hours work to investigators, who used new DNA technology to match the specific strain of spores in Ivins' lab with the one used in the attacks.\n\nThose were among the revelations contained in court documents unsealed Wednesday, as the U.S. government proclaimed it had solved the nation's worst case of bioterrorism. The anthrax attacks, which involved mailings of powdered spores that killed five people and sickened at least 17 others, jolted a country reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks and have been a major mystery of the post-9/11 period.\n\nThe release of the court documents and the government briefing that followed shed light on the evidence against Ivins, 62, who died July 29 from an overdose of acetaminophen. Yet they also raised new questions about the government's handling of the seven-year anthrax probe, which initially focused on another scientist and turned toward Ivins less than two years ago.\n\n\"We are confident, based on the evidence we had, that we could prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt,\" said Jeffrey Taylor, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. \"We are confident that Dr. Ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks.\"\n\nThe government's assertion was disputed by Ivins' lawyers, who issued a statement calling the Justice Department briefing an \"orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements, heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence \u2014 all contorted to create the illusion of guilt by Dr. Ivins.\"\n\nMuch of the evidence against Ivins is circumstantial, including an e-mail he sent to an associate after the 9/11 terror attacks that contained warnings about terrorists having \"anthrax and sarin gas,\" and having \"decreed death to all Jews and Americans. There was similar language in the letters that were mailed with the deadly powder.\n\nThe court papers released Wednesday also alleged that Ivins, when asked to provide samples of certain anthrax spores for testing by investigators, tried to mislead agents by providing other types of spores \u2014 and then lied about doing so. The documents also describe increasingly erratic and threatening behavior by Ivins as federal agents pressured him for details.\n\nTaylor and others noted that such circumstantial evidence is routinely used to win convictions in U.S. courts, but some legal analysts found the government's case against Ivins lacking.\n\nThey noted that beyond matching the spores used in the attacks to those \"created and solely maintained\" by Ivins at the U.S. lab at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Md., the documents cited no physical evidence \u2014 no hair or handwriting match, for example.\n\n\"If they're saying, 'We found the guy, and this is it,' to me this falls short of that mark,\" said Michael Greenberger of the Center for Health and Homeland Security at the University of Maryland School of Law. \"There's a lot of circumstantial evidence that certainly supports probable cause, but I have questions (about) whether this proves anything beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nSome scientists, however, saw the link between the specific type of spores used in the attacks to Ivins' lab as particularly strong.\n\nIn early 2005, using new techniques, FBI scientists identified the \"genetically unique\" parent used in the anthrax mailings.\n\nEight of the lab samples the FBI collected had four genetic mutations unique to the anthrax mailings, an affidavit says. All came from a single flask, called \"RMR-1029,\" that Ivins created and maintained at the Fort Detrick lab. The affidavit says Ivins was the \"sole custodian\" of the flask since its anthrax was first grown in 1997.\n\n\"We have a flask that's effectively the murder weapon, from which those spores were taken, that was controlled by Dr. Ivins,\" Taylor said, adding that others with potential access to the flask gradually were ruled out as suspects starting in 2005. \"The anthrax in that flask was created by Dr. Ivins.\"\n\nSteven Salzberg, a University of Maryland biologist, says that \"finding those four mutations, that's pretty compelling evidence.\" Salzberg was an author of the 2002 Science magazine paper that first released genetic details of the anthrax in the 2001 bioterrorist letters.\n\n\"If Bruce Ivins has been the 'sole custodian' \u2014 if that's true \u2014 then they got him,\" Salzberg said.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, where several buildings had to be shut down after anthrax-laced letters were sent to then-senator Tom Daschle and Sen. Patrick Leahy in 2001, the Justice Department's briefing drew some skepticism.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., whose district includes a mailbox that was used to send the letters containing anthrax, said that \"while the circumstantial evidence pointing to Dr. Ivins \u2026 is compelling, a number of important questions remain unanswered, such as why investigators remained focused on Dr. (Steven) Hatfill long after they had begun to suspect Dr. Ivins \u2026 and why investigators are so certain that Ivins acted alone.\"\n\nWhen tainted letters began arriving at news organizations and the Senate offices in mid-September 2001, the FBI initially focused on foreign terrorists.\n\nThen investigators began to suspect Hatfill, another Fort Detrick weapons scientist, whom then-attorney general John Ashcroft called \"a person of interest\" in the case. Hatfill was subjected to 24-hour surveillance.\n\nThe FBI wiretapped his phone and accosted him at job interviews, according to a lawsuit he later filed that accused the government of invading his privacy and ruining his career.\n\nIn June, Hatfill won a $5.82 million settlement in the case.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taylor said the government began to consider Ivins as the primary suspect last year.\n\n\"We thoroughly investigated every other person who could have had access\" to the key flask of anthrax at the Fort Detrick lab, \"and we were able to rule out all but Dr. Ivins,\" Taylor said.\n\nThe probe found that Ivins had access to a sophisticated machine that could have been used to dry the anthrax spores to make them airborne. In the days before each of the 2001 anthrax mailings, Ivins worked at the lab unusually late into the night and on weekends in the high-security section where the anthrax is stored, the probe found. When questioned by FBI agents, he said he was having trouble at home, the documents say.\n\nA few days before the attacks began, the government says, Ivins sent the e-mail that used language similar to that of the anthrax letters.\n\nAmong the other evidence outlined Wednesday:\n\n\u2022Envelopes used in the mailings were available in only a few places, including the Frederick, Md., post office frequented by Ivins.\n\n\u2022The court documents cited e-mails in which he acknowledged being paranoid and depressed and said he was obsessed with a sorority that has an office near the Princeton, N.J., mailbox used to send some of the anthrax letters.\n\nEventually, the FBI began watching Ivins day and night. He showed \"consciousness of guilt,\" Taylor said. Ivins also told people at his group therapy session that he wanted to kill those who had wronged him, Taylor said.\n\nThat was on July 9, according an affidavit. Ivins told the social worker and group members that he was a suspect in the anthrax investigation.\n\n\"He stated \u2026 he was angry at investigators, the government and the system in general. He said he was not going to face the death penalty, (and) had a plan to kill co-workers and other individuals,\" the document says. \"He said he had a bulletproof vest and a list of co-workers and \u2026 was going to obtain a Glock firearm from his son within the next day because federal agents are watching him and he could not obtain a weapon on his own.\"\n\nThe social worker called the Frederick police, who took him into custody and sent him to a hospital for evaluation. He was later released.\n\n'He did some stupid things'\n\nEvidence of a potential motive for Ivins to have sent the letters is scant. Investigators have pointed to trouble at work with a failing anthrax vaccine and a possible cut in his program.\n\nThe FBI has not said how agents eliminated as suspects others in the lab who also may have had access to Ivins' flask.\n\nThe FBI also did not explain why it relied on Ivins to assist their probe even after the 2003 incident in which Ivins gave investigators unsuitable anthrax samples from his lab.\n\nAnd agents have not been able to place Ivins at the Princeton mailbox where the anthrax letters were mailed, but they say he had the time in his work and home schedules to drive there the days the letters were mailed.\n\nOne of the nation's leading anthrax researchers, Martin Hugh-Jones of Louisiana State University, says the documents leave some critical questions unanswered.\n\nFor example, they fail to confirm a genetic match between the strain of anthrax found in Ivins' laboratory and the first victim, Robert Stevens of American Media in Boca Raton, Fla.\n\n\"The evidence points at Ivins, but they don't give evidence excluding other people working in the same facility,\" Hugh-Jones says, adding, \"Bruce didn't help himself. He did some very stupid things.\"\n\nGeneticist Michael Stebbins of the Federation of American Scientists in Washington, D.C., notes that the science is not very detailed in the affidavit, which the government prepared to obtain approval for a search warrant \u2014 not to present its case to a jury.\n\n\"The four mutations, that alone isn't a smoking gun, but it certainly is compelling evidence that the anthrax came from the flask where Ivins worked,\" he says.\n\nHolt, who was briefed Wednesday by FBI Director Robert Mueller, says, \"I hope that as the rest of the information comes out, it will seem more than just another assertion by the FBI that they've got the right guy.\"\n\n'No doubt in my mind'\n\nVictims of the anthrax attacks and family members of those who died reacted emotionally at a private briefing by Mueller, said Patrick O'Donnell, a New Jersey postal worker who was infected by the anthrax. It lasted nearly four hours and included every agent assigned to the case.\n\n\"A lot of people were breaking up, crying,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nHe found the evidence circumstantial, but solid. \"I pretty much have no doubt in my mind he did it now,\" he said. However, he wishes Ivins were alive to stand trial. \"It left a lot of doors open.\"\n\nIvins' attorney, Paul Kemp, attended a memorial service for Ivins on Wednesday at Fort Detrick.\n\n\"I don't understand how 250 scientists and soldiers, including the base commander and the commanding general, could be here eulogizing Bruce and the FBI seriously consider him a suspect,\" Kemp said via e-mail. \"In the words of his commander, he was open, sharing, funny and scientifically brilliant.\"\n\nTaylor, though, said the Justice Department is in the process of ending its investigation and plans to formally close the case.\n\n\"We regret that we will not have the opportunity to present the evidence to a jury,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Marisol Bello and Rebecca Kaplan\n\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

(Mae Katt/Twitter)\n\nThe nurse attributes the mental illness to \"25 years of a suicide crisis that never got addressed\" in northern Ontario's First Nations.\n\nThere have been more than 500 suicides among the approximately 45,000 First Nations people who live in the region in that time, Katt said.\n\nThe current generation of students is the first to be raised in the \"sub-culture of suicide,\" where their parents use drugs to cope with unresolved trauma, grief and loss, she explained.\n\n\"Adults are not doing drugs by choice.

    "text": "The old Middlesex County courthouse is an unpolished diamond that can be transformed into a gleaming outpost for the booming technology community in nearby Kendall Square that is spreading into East Cambridge.\n\nThe old Middlesex County courthouse is a towering eyesore that once again threatens to violate a quaint residential neighborhood of modest homes and workers cottages.\n\nThat\u2019s the crux of a raging debate in Cambridge as a developer picked by the state moves forward with plans to overhaul one of the most visible buildings on the outskirts of Boston\u2019s skyline. Although the two courts once housed there are gone, about 200 prisoners remain on the upper floors of the 22-story structure, in the Middlesex Jail.\n\nLeggat McCall Properties is seeking to start work this summer on turning the Edward J. Sullivan Courthouse at 40 Thorndike St. into a home for high-tech offices, along with additional retail and residential space \u2014 a project estimated to cost more than $200 million. It would replace most of the gray facade with glass and improve the forbidding ground-level space by adding a small park and more pedestrian access.\n\nWith demand high for Kendall office space, Leggat McCall executive vice president Robert Dickey said, converting the courthouse will help keep high-tech companies in Cambridge.\n\n\u201cOur objective . . . is to attract high-tech tenants, small innovation companies, as well as mature companies, and they don\u2019t have a lot to choose from today,\u201d Dickey said.\n\nBut nearby residents contend redevelopment of a building that never should have been erected will hurt a neighborhood increasingly leery of the creeping advances of Kendall Square toward their quiet pocket of Cambridge. They are pressuring city officials to reject the special permits Leggat McCall needs to pull off its redevelopment project.\n\nThe neighbors are also proposing a radical change for the 282-foot-tall building \u2014 chopping it down to comply with the area\u2019s 80-foot height limit.\n\n\u201cThe building was a mistake and everybody knows it,\u201d said East Cambridge resident Michael Hawley. \u201cIt\u2019s rare in life that you get a chance to undo a mistake like this.\u201d\n\nSeveral Cambridge city councilors are calling on the state and Leggat McCall to work together to substantially reduce the height, traffic, and environmental impacts of the development.\n\n\u201cThis is a building that probably never should have been built. That is the problem,\u201d said Councilor Dennis Carlone.\n\nOn one point, all parties agree: The building is ugly. Leggat McCall describes the 1970s-era architecture as Brutalist. When the state built the courthouse it was exempt from local zoning laws, and the 22-story tower soared above neighboring homes.\n\nThe courthouse is also toxic. It is so shot through with asbestos that Middlesex Superior Court relocated to Woburn in 2008 and Cambridge District Court moved to Medford in 2009. Leggat McCall estimates it will cost at least $30 million to remove the asbestos.\n\nAs for the county prisoners, they will be moved to the Middlesex House of Correction in Billerica until a new jail and court complex is built.\n\nDespite the hurdles, Dickey believes the old building can be turned into a neighborhood asset. As high-tech development pushes out from Kendall Square and the North Point development project progresses on the other side of East Cambridge, he said, the converted building would serve as a link between the two and also aid a neighborhood goal to improve business along Cambridge and First streets.\n\nDeveloper\u2019s vision for 40 Thorndike St.\n\nDevelopment in the area already has extended beyond Kendall Square with a series of projects by Alexandria Real Estate, including the recently completed Biogen Idec headquarters on Binney Street. Alexandria is constructing additional office and research space on Binney Street and a residential building at the intersection of Binney and Third streets.\n\nA Cambridge Community Development Department report in December identified the US Department of Transportation\u2019s Volpe Research Center at the corner of Broadway and Third Street as a potential site for more office and residential space.\n\nBut Brian Murphy, Cambridge\u2019s assistant city manager for community development, said Third Street has a different feel farther from Kendall Square.\n\nHe said the area around the courthouse wasn\u2019t considered in the city\u2019s Kendall Square study.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking and saying that Third Street is an area that is really going to be transformed,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nThe state selected Leggat McCall to redevelop the courthouse after the developer submitted the highest of three bids to purchase the building in late 2012. The price has not been disclosed, but the state Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance expects to close the sale this spring.\n\nIn addition to facade changes, Leggat McCall plans to convert the upper floors into office space geared toward the types of technology firms associated with Kendall Square. To address neighborhood calls for residential space, the developer has included 24 residential units on the lower floors, and there will be room for retail stores on ground level.\n\nBut Hawley said the building is \u201cgrossly outsized\u201d for its location, and neighbors say converting the facade to glass will create problems with solar glare during the day and light pollution at night. They have launched a website, 40thorndike.org, to publicize their concerns, which also include potential traffic and parking problems.\n\nRhoda Fantasia, who has lived on Third Street for 20 years, said the project has raised residents\u2019 awareness of development pressures facing East Cambridge. Many worry about no longer being able to afford to live in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThey have likened what is going on in Kendall Square and now pushing toward North Point, with this 40 Thorndike Street being in the middle, as a malignancy creeping, creeping, creeping,\u201d Fantasia said.\n\nLeggat McCall has launched its own website, courb.co/40thorndike, to tout the public benefits of the project, including about $3 million in new tax revenue for the city, the creation of construction jobs for four years, and approximately 1,500 permanent jobs in the building once the work is done.\n\nDickey said Leggat McCall has met with neighbors about its proposal and is willing to talk about the possibility of a height reduction.\n\n\u201cThat will be part of the discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, I don\u2019t know if that makes it a better project or not.\u201d",

Since then, the black-and-white picture of Merle Haggard in the clear plastic photo holder on the front has become so tattered, it looks like the top half of his forehead has been erased.\n\nShe also has a .243 shell dangling from a chain.\n\n\"Don't you expect me to have a bullet necklace?\" says the 27-year-old singer who has, in her songs, trashed a pool hall, plotted to shoot an abusive lover, and, metaphorically at least, blown up a bunch of stuff.\n\nThe cover of her new album, Four the Record, out today, shows her walking away from a car in flames. \"People have been saying, 'You're on fire right now,'\" she says. \"So I thought I'd light something on fire.\"\n\nNot 24 hours before, Lambert was sitting in a deer stand in Oklahoma, hunting with husband Blake Shelton, whom she married in May.\n\nNow, though, she's ready to ramp up promotional efforts for Four the Record, her fourth album for Columbia Records.\n\nThe singer who came to national prominence as a teenager on cable competition Nashville Star has sold more than 1 million copies of each of her three major-label albums. The most recent and best-selling of those, 2009's Revolution, earned her a Grammy for single The House That Built Me and won album of the year awards from the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music.\n\nFour the Record raises the game again, steering away from current mainstream country forms to create a unique sound that's alternately folky and funky, with plenty of Lambert's firebrand attitude. Bolstered by her critical and commercial success, Lambert feels the confidence to take her music in new directions.\n\n\"Why not?\" she says. \"I'm at the exact point in my career where I've earned the right to take a chance, and I'm going to.\"\n\nWith her marriage to fellow country singer Shelton, 35, she also is more famous than she has ever been. That sort of thing's great for career momentum \u2014 acts often get risk-averse musically as they get more famous \u2014 but all the celebrity attention can be frustrating for someone who takes so much pride in her musical achievements.\n\nIt just would be nice if country's current \"it\" couple got to see each other more often.\n\n\"I haven't really gotten to experience being married yet, to be honest,\" Lambert says. \"I'm just ready to, like, be home and be in the kitchen and do dishes \u2014 do what married couples are supposed to do. Hang out.\"\n\nWith both singers touring for most of the year and juggling side projects \u2014 for Lambert, it's her Pistol Annies trio, whose Hell on Heels made its debut atop Billboard's country album chart in August; for Shelton, his judging duties on NBC's The Voice\u2014 the rare time time together, especially at home, is usually scheduled well in advance. Initially, Lambert didn't think they'd even have time for a honeymoon.\n\n\"I thought we were going to stay home. He said, 'Let's take a road trip around Oklahoma, and I'll show you some things you've never seen.' I said OK, and packed a two-day bag and got a dog sitter.\n\n\"We were headed down the road, and he pulled into a private airport. He was like, 'There's a jet out there waiting; grab your stuff.'\" They ended up going to Cancun, and Lambert calls the three-day surprise trip the most romantic thing Shelton has ever done for her.\n\nLatest in the line of country couples\n\nSteve Moore, chief executive officer of the CMA, sees the two singers as part of the rich history of country couples, among them George Jones and Tammy Wynette, Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.\n\n\"We've always had those pairings, either in music or in marital collaborations,\" Moore says. \"With Blake and Miranda, it doesn't seem to get in their way. I don't see them trying to leverage that relationship beyond what it is naturally.\"\n\nShelton does have a presence on Four the Record\u2014 he and Lambert co-wrote Over You, and they sing together on Better in the Long Run\u2014 but he's just part of a large supporting cast.\n\n\"This record feels like a community,\" Lambert says. \"It has so much personality, because so many different people had a part on it.\"\n\nSteve Winwood played organ on first singleBaggage Claim, and Josh Kelley, who toured this year with Lambert, added harmony. Lambert cut songs co-written by Angaleena Presley and Ashley Monroe, her partners in Pistol Annies. Singer/songwriters Allison Moorer and Brandi Carlile wrote songs for Lambert and sang on them. Little Big Town's Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman sang on Lambert's cover of Gillian Welch and David Rawlings' Look at Miss Ohio.\n\n\"I see so many people second-guessing themselves and sticking their finger in the wind,\" says producer Frank Liddell. \"Miranda just gets a collection of songs she loves.\"\n\nOne thing Four the Record isn't: a newlywed's album, full of love songs . \"That crazy girl inside of me will always be there,\" she says. \"I don't think getting married or becoming a mom would change that part of my personality \u2014 it just adds to my personality.\"\n\nThe song Lambert sings with Shelton comes from the perspective of two people who can't leave each other, no matter how much they want to, and the one she wrote with him deals with the death of his brother. Safe, one of two songs Lambert wrote by herself, begins, \"Just like the fringe on my boots, you move with every step I take.\" But in the other, Dear Diamond, an unfaithful wife confesses her sins to her wedding ring.\n\nLambert has given the public and the country-music industry reason to expect a lot from her.\n\n\"Miranda's done a brilliant job of creating a marketable image. In this industry, those often get molded by other people. But Miranda was instrumental in creating hers,\" says CMT Top 20 Countdown host Evan Farmer. \"She clearly knows what she wants with her music and knows how to go about doing it.\"\n\nLambert seeks a multifaceted career\n\nLambert would like to parlay her music success into a variety of career opportunities. \"I hope my music sets up the platform for me to be able to do lots of things \u2014 to have a cowboy-boot line, maybe, or do a perfume or makeup deal.\"\n\nShe and Shelton are producing an album for singer Neal McCoy, who sang at their wedding. She also has a line of wines \u2014 some sporting the names of singles like Kerosene and White Liar.\n\nLambert looks to Reba McEntire and Dolly Parton as role models for expanding an entertainment career, though she says she probably won't follow them into acting. Unless, that is, she can snag a guest spot on Law & Order: SVU.\n\n\"I just love that show, so I'm desperate,\" she says. \"Even if I have to play a dead girl, I'll be on.\"\n\nRecently, Lambert ran into Faith Hill, and the two talked tours. \"I told her, 'Everybody keeps asking Blake and me if we're going on tour. Until it's Soul2Soul big (Hill's top-drawing 2000 tour with husband Tim McGraw), we're not going.' We've got big shoes to fill.\n\n\"Both of us want to get as far as we can get and as big as we can get on our own first. I want to sell out arenas, and he wants to sell out arenas. When the time's right, heck, yeah, we'd love to go on a tour together.\"\n\nThat time's not now. Lambert will start her On Fire tour in Rockford, Ill., on Jan. 12, the same day Shelton kicks off his Well Lit & Amplified tour in Toledo, Ohio.\n\nThe two have, however, put all their awards together in Shelton's house in Oklahoma. \"It's the only thing that we have in the house that's all of mine and all of his \u2014 stuff's still spread out everywhere,\" says Lambert, who also has a house just down the road. \"We have all our CMAs, ACMs, CMT belt buckles and BMI Awards in the case in the house. And it's full already.\n\n\"I was like, 'Look, Blake, we're awesome! We have all these awards!' When we build a house, we can have a shelf that's big enough for them all.\"\n\nLambert could add to the trophy case : She's the CMA's reigning female vocalist, and she's up for that prize again at the 45th annual ceremony Nov. 9. She also has a nomination for Coal Miner's Daughter with Loretta Lynn and Sheryl Crow.\n\nWhether or not she wins, \"I feel like I'm in a great spot,\" Lambert says. \"I've kind of achieved the goals that I'd set for right now. Now I'm at this point where I'm getting a whole other set of goals.\n\n\"I try not to get too ahead of myself. I try to be happy where I am.\"",

    "text": "Leave it to Thomas Schnetz to sneak humble dishes like fideo in among the Niman Ranch beef tacos and Mexican Caesar salad on the menu at Tacubaya, his taqueria in Berkeley's luxe Fourth Street shopping district.\n\nFideo ($6.95) is Mexican home cooking, as simple as it comes -- angel hair pasta drenched in a soupy tomato sauce, with a hint of chile heat and a sprinkle of queso cotijo -- and it springs from abuelita's kitchen, generations back.\n\nYou don't see this dish all that often on Mexican menus around here. But that's typical of Schnetz, both at his upscale Mexican restaurant Dona Tomas in Oakland's Temescal area, and at its 20-month-old offspring, Tacubaya, which he co-owns.\n\nHis thing is to offer some real Mexican cooking made with seasonal, local ingredients, and it's proved popular at both of his places.\n\nGenerally, that popularity is deserved. But while the quality of Tacubaya's food is never in question, sometimes the seasonings either over- or under-whelm.\n\nTacubaya opened as an all-day breakfast and lunch place for shoppers in need of a quick bite, and now stays open for dinner on weekends.\n\nIts large, high-ceilinged space tucked back off Fourth Street is a fiesta of color: shiny walls of cerise, tomato, ruby red, tangerine. Along the left side, as you walk up to the counter to order, a mini-market sells the restaurant's guacamole, camote (a sweet potato sider), salsas and beans, containers of ingredients like lard, canela, piloncillo (sugar cane) and queso, and wooden and metal tortilla makers.\n\nFrom here, you may spot someone busy hand-making corn tortillas behind the counter -- they're one of the high points of any meal. Order, grab one of the 46 seats either at the counter or wooden tables, and your food will arrive quickly.\n\nThe dish I'd hurry back for is the sopa de tortilla ($6.25). A deep red- brown, the thick soup is rich with chile and chicken flavor. Dip in for hunks of avocado, cubes of melting cheese and chewy fried tortilla strips. It's a meal by itself.\n\nLots of mushrooms and epazote add substance and flavor to the cheese stuffing inside the chile relleno ($5.95), a fat, 7-inch poblano chile. This is not your basic Mission relleno. Lightly battered and fried, it sits in a light tomato sauce, criss-crossed with crema. Though it's dense, it's not at all greasy and it's very good.\n\nTacos are classic style, done well. Double-layered handmade tortillas come with Niman Ranch beef, spit-roasted pork or beef tongue, or fish (all $3. 15 for one), and the usual garnishes.\n\nThe fish taco sported a big chunk of light, crispy batter-fried white fish, but it gained nothing from the arbol chile aioli, where too much sweetness concealed any chile taste.\n\nSweetness seemed to be a bit of a theme, and not always a welcome one.\n\nThe tamal ($3.75), stuffed with lots of browned pork in mole and served in a corn husk, played the browned meat against deep chile flavors very well, but it too could have been less sweet and a bit more hot.\n\nAlongside, we got the camote ($2.95), a puree with loads of sweet potato flavor, but also a strong dose of the maple sugar-like Mexican piloncillo. A great offset to all the spice, but still too sweet.\n\nOne surprise was the unconventional take on ceviche de pescado ($7.75). It arrived on a large oval plate, slathered in a thick sauce of New Mexico and puya chiles and surrounded by tortilla chips. You fish for chunks of fresh tuna and avocado -- but their delicate flavors are overpowered by the strong, very hot sauce. Still, we eventually ate it all, and the sauce came in handy for perking up other dishes.\n\nBreakfast, served until noon on weekdays and through the afternoon on weekends, is worth the stop, if for nothing but the Blue Bottle coffee ($2) --\n\neach big, white cup made to order. Most of the dishes feature eggs -- with chorizo, or on a torta with ham, or scrambled with nopales and tomatoes.\n\nThe chilaquiles ($7.50) are like eggy nachos, and I could eat them all day. Housemade tortilla chips are sauteed in guajillo chile sauce, then topped with scrambled eggs, onions, cheese and crema. The heat picks up the eggs, the eggs temper the chile -- it works.\n\nAs soon as the huevos divorciados ($7.25) land on the table, you can see where they got their name. Precisely half the plate swims in a sweetish green tomatillo sauce and the other half in a clean-tasting red sauce. But the divorce doesn't last -- the sauces get pleasantly mixed up in the eating.\n\nMenudo ($7.25), served on weekends, was a hearty bowl full of lots of tripe and hominy. But while the broth looked richly luscious, and tasted strongly of chile and beef, the seasoning was off and the problem wasn't just serious undersalting. The depth -- menudo's soul -- wasn't there.\n\nBreakfast, lunch or dinner, don't overlook the churro ($3.50), made while you wait. Here's one place the sweetness really works.\n\nTacubaya is on the rise, with a liquor license in the works so you can have a beer with your tacos, along with the fruity aguas frescas ($2.50) and horchata ($2.50) now offered.\n\nThat will be a boon to the dinner service. If things continue to go well, Tacubaya hopes to take dinner to seven days a week.",

    "text": "In 2011, the New York University psychologist Gabriele Oettingen published the results of an elegant study, conducted with her colleague Heather Kappes, in which participants were deprived of water. Some of these parched volunteers were then taken through a guided visualisation exercise, in which they were asked to picture an icy glass of water, the very thing they presumably craved. Afterwards, by measuring everyone\u2019s blood pressure, Oettingen discovered that the exercise had drained people\u2019s energy levels, and made them relax. The implication is startling: picturing an imaginary glass of water might make people less motivated to get up and head to the watercooler or the tap in order to quench their real, non-imaginary thirst.\n\nThis conclusion is precisely the reverse of one of the central tenets of pop psychology: the idea that picturing the future you desire makes it more likely you\u2019ll attain it. Again and again, in her research, Oettingen has shown that making a fantasy of something you want can make it harder to achieve in reality. Imagine yourself having a productive week, and you\u2019ll accomplish less. Imagine receiving a windfall of cash, and you\u2019ll be less motivated to engage in the kinds of activities that might bring you money. Intriguingly \u2013 though admittedly the link may not be causal \u2013 there\u2019s even a relationship between how much \u201cpositive thinking\u201d language American presidents use in their inaugural speeches, and how much unemployment rates change by the end of their presidential terms. The more positive the fantasy about the future, the fewer jobs in real life.\n\nFist-pumping motivational gurus have long claimed that your brain \u201ccan\u2019t distinguish between reality and imagination\u201d. Ironically, Oettingen\u2019s experiments show they\u2019re right about that \u2013 but also that the conclusion they draw is spectacularly wrong. Attempting to \u201cexperience your success as if it had already materialized\u201d is a fast-track to disappointment.\n\nThankfully, not all kinds of thinking about the future are quite so self-sabotaging. In Oettingen\u2019s new book, Rethinking Positive Thinking, published in the USon Thursday and elsewhere next month, she makes the case for \u201cmental contrasting\u201d, a technique that involves methodically combining positive and negative thoughts about your own future, in a way that seems to work strikingly well if you\u2019re trying to replace bad habits or mindsets with good ones. Over the last decade, in studies conducted by Oettingen and other researchers, mental contrasting has been shown to double the amount of exercise people engage in; to increase their fruit and vegetable intake by 30%; and to help people suffering from chronic pain become more physically active. When low-income schoolchildren in Germany and the US were trained briefly in the method, it led to increased school attendance and better academic performance.\n\nThe technique\u2019s full formal name is less than catchy \u2013 \u201cmental contrasting with implementation intentions\u201d \u2013 so in her book, Oettingen rebrands it as \u201cWoop\u201d, for \u201cwish, outcome, obstacle, plan\u201d. The acronym sets out the four stages of the process. First, spend a minute or two thinking in detail about something you wish to accomplish; second, vividly imagine the best thing you associate with having achieved that outcome. (That \u201cbest thing\u201d might be an emotion, a promotion, praise \u2013 anything, really.) Third, ask yourself what internal obstacle\u2019s most likely to get in the way. (This isn\u2019t about your boss, or your spouse, so much as that weakness inside you that holds you back from better pay or a better relationship.) Finally, formulate an \u201cif-then\u201d plan for what you\u2019ll do when that obstacle arises. (\u201cIf I find myself feeling terrified when I stand up in front of the audience, then I\u2019ll recall how diligently I\u2019ve rehearsed.\u201d \u201cIf I find myself checking Twitter, I\u2019ll get up from my desk immediately.\u201d)\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a bit of positive daydreaming if it makes you feel good, so long as you don\u2019t expect anything more than feeling good. \u201cDaydreaming can be great!\u201d Oettingen told me the other day. \u201cIt\u2019s only when it comes to actually realizing these dreams that positive dreaming is problematic, because it feigns that you\u2019ve already attained these desired futures. You relax, your energy goes down. It\u2019s a question of: \u2018Why face the hardships of the bumpy road to achieving these things in real life, if you can float away on dreams?\u2019\u201d\n\nMental contrasting retains the most useful part of positive fantasies: it clarifies what you want, and reminds you how good it can feel to attain, say, a pay increase, a new job, a smaller waistline or a happier relationship. But then it exploits the motivating power of knowing what you have not yetattained \u2013 that there\u2019s serious ground you\u2019ll have to cover. (Getting fit, improving a marriage, making more money \u2013 it all takes work.)Finally, the Wooping technique nudges you to plan in advance for what you\u2019ll do once, inevitably, your own flawed personality gets in the way.\n\nAnd so mental contrasting pushes back against one of the great, disempowering lies of positive thinking: that transformative change, personal or societal, can be made effortless. It can\u2019t. In fact, Oettingen\u2019s research suggests, convincing yourself that life\u2019s meant to be easy just makes it appreciably harder. The best way to quench your thirst for change, it seems, is to remind yourself that the glass is still half empty.",

    "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The last time Chris Rock hosted the Oscars, he was judged by many to be a bust.\n\n\u201cLoud, snide and dismissive, he wasn\u2019t just a disappointment,\u201d wrote the USA Today critic Robert Bianco in 2005. \u201cHe ranks up there with the worst hosts ever.\u201d Other reports noted that the audience for Mr. Rock\u2019s show had dropped by 5 percent, to about 42.2 million viewers, from the year before, when Billy Crystal did the honors.\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the future.\n\nIt would take nine years for another host to beat Mr. Rock\u2019s audience. That was Ellen DeGeneres, who got 43.7 million viewers in 2014 \u2014 and, measured against a larger population, she actually fell a bit short of his Nielsen ratings.\n\nAs for snide and dismissive, almost anything that gets the numbers up when Mr. Rock takes the Oscars stage on Sunday will most likely be fine with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which gives out the Oscars, and ABC, which broadcasts the show.\n\nReturning after 11 years, Mr. Rock inherits a ceremony in crisis, as the academy grapples with a deeper problem than the television ratings: diversity.\n\nFor the second straight year Oscar voters snubbed minorities in the acting categories. Would-be viewers who are angry about that may not watch the telecast as a result. (Last year, the number of black viewers fell about 20 percent, according to Nielsen data.)\n\nOthers may be turned off by the crackle of racial politics around a show that they view as pure entertainment. (\u201cCan\u2019t we just enjoy a big TV event without being lectured?\u201d the conservative activist L. Brent Bozell III wrote about pleas for equality at last year\u2019s ceremony.)\n\nQuincy Jones, one of at least a dozen black celebrities lined up in recent weeks to appear at Sunday\u2019s ceremony as presenters, had said this month that he would hand out a trophy only if given five minutes to address diversity. That would approximately match the length of last year\u2019s opening musical number by Anna Kendrick, Jack Black and the ceremony\u2019s host, Neil Patrick Harris. A spokesman for Mr. Jones confirmed that he would appear, but declined to say whether he was promised added airtime.\n\nEarl Ofari Hutchinson, president of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, said last week in an email that his group and others were continuing to back what they call the \u201cWhite Oscars Tune-Out.\u201d They were also planning Oscar day protests in Hollywood and at ABC stations in New York, Washington, Detroit, Cleveland, Miami and Atlanta.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect the ratings numbers to be down, and much of that will be due to the pressure,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said.\n\nHe dismissed recent steps by the academy to make its membership and governing boards more diverse as \u201ctime-delaying, cumbersome and convoluted.\u201d The academy\u2019s goal, he added, was \u201cto snatch lots of favorable PR, give the appearance of change and make the protest go away.\u201d Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the academy\u2019s president, he said, had declined to meet with his organization or others to discuss further changes.\n\nA spokeswoman for the academy declined to comment, and said neither Mr. Rock nor the show\u2019s producers, Reginald Hudlin and David Hill, would agree to be interviewed about plans for the ceremony.\n\nThe ratings numbers are of paramount concern to the academy, which derives the largest part of its income from the awards ceremony. Last year the audience fell 15 percent, to about 37.3 million viewers. At the same time, ABC has been raising prices for its ads; they now cost an average of $1.9 million to $2 million for a 30-second spot, up as much as 11 percent from a year ago, according to a report released by Kantar Media last week.\n\nThe report said ABC took in about $110 million from last year\u2019s broadcast, up by almost half from $74 million in 2011, as rates jumped, and the network increased its advertising minutes during the show by about 25 percent, to 29 minutes and 45 seconds. By contrast, the 2015 Grammys had about $75 million in ad revenue last year, and the Golden Globes took in about $42 million, according to Kantar.\n\nThe academy receives roughly $110 million annually from the show, including fees related to ABC\u2019s domestic broadcast, separate income from distribution around the world, and other Oscar-related revenue. Assuring financial stability for the awards has become more critical for the academy, which last year sold about $350 million in bonds to support a new movie museum.\n\nCast your vote for all the award nominees. Complete your Oscars ballot.\n\nOverall quality? Directorial perfection? Stellar cast? Whatever your reasoning, pick your vote for Best Picture.\n\nCast your vote for your favorite directing work this year.\n\nCast your vote for your favorite actor this year.\n\nCast your vote for your favorite actress this year.\n\nCast your vote for your favorite supporting actor this year.\n\nCast your vote for your favorite supporting actress this year.\n\nCast your vote for all the major Oscar categories. Complete Your Full Ballot \u00bb\n\nUnder a long-term contract, ABC has agreed to air the Oscars through 2020. But a ratings collapse of the kind that occurred in 2008 \u2014 contributing to a 16 percent drop in ad revenue the next year \u2014 could squeeze the network by reducing future advertising rates, and an Oscar-day boycott that reduced viewership could dent ABC\u2019s brand. The Disney-owned network has promoted itself as leading a TV industry push toward greater racial diversity (and on Wednesday, in a first for a major broadcaster, hired a black president of entertainment).\n\nSo much depends on Mr. Rock, who is not known for diplomacy.\n\nDays after the 9/11 terror attacks, he tried out jokes in a Los Angeles comedy club about those trapped in the World Trade Center. His most recent film, two years ago, was \u201cTop Five,\u201d about a comic trying to get his mojo back. (Mr. Rock was writer, director and star.) It included a subplot in which its protagonist, Andre Allen, promotes his work in a film about a slave rebellion that killed 50,000 white people.\n\nScott Rudin, who was a producer of \u201cTop Five,\u201d suggested that Mr. Rock on Sunday will be served by his time spent working along cultural edges.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about who can walk a tightrope, he makes Philippe Petit look like an amateur,\u201d Mr. Rudin said in a phone interview, referring to a real-life high-wire artist who once walked between the World Trade Center towers.\n\nMr. Rock\u2019s aggressive comic style, seen as a bit much in 2005, may be less shocking in an era inured to the bawdy ramblings of an Amy Schumer, or the beery barbs of a Ricky Gervais, both of whom graced this year\u2019s Golden Globes (which largely featured the same films that the Oscars will, and saw its audience drop 5 percent from 2015).\n\nOf bigger concern, perhaps, are the size and currency of Mr. Rock\u2019s fan base. Ms. DeGeneres had the advantage of a daily talk show, and a Twitter following of 39 million. Neil Patrick Harris, last year\u2019s host, appeared in the hit CBS series \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d through 2014, and had about 13.5 million followers.\n\nMr. Rock has 3.8 million followers, and has appeared only occasionally on television since 2009, when the CW network last aired new episodes of \u201cEverybody Hates Chris,\u201d a series for which he was narrator and executive producer.\n\nIn a 2013 interview with The Sioux City Journal, posted on his official website, Mr. Rock spoke of having passed up spots as a late-night television host to spend time with his two young daughters. At the time, he was among the producers of a talk show, \u201cTotally Biased with W. Kamau Bell.\u201d (Mr. Bell described Mr. Rock as \u201cthe foul-mouthed Yoda.\u201d) And he was awaiting the release of \u201cGrown Ups 2,\u201d in which he joined Adam Sandler in a comic ensemble.\n\n\u201cTop Five\u201d took in just $25 million in North America after Paramount Pictures released it in December 2014. But critics liked it.\n\n\u201cChris Rock is the smartest person I know,\u201d Mr. Rudin said. \u201cIf there is one person never to bet against, it\u2019s him.\u201d",

The Oculus CEO and his team have worked for years and are understandable thrilled to finally launch the Rift virtual reality headset into the wild. Everything we\u2019ve seen personally has been fairly impressive\u2014even if not everyone agrees with that.\n\nBut with all due respect, Luckey\u2019s enthusiasm might be starting to run away with him. Rather than seeing virtual reality as the next great leap in technology, he\u2019s starting to prosthelytize it as the end-all, be-all of technological achievements.\n\n\u201cIf you have perfect virtual reality eventually, where you\u2019re be able to simulate everything that a human can experience or imagine experiencing, it\u2019s hard to imagine where you go from there,\u201d Luckey told NPR on Monday. \u201cOnce you have perfect virtual reality, what else are you supposed to perfect?\u201d\n\nAgain, with all due respect, that\u2019s just stupid.\n\nThere are all sorts of exciting technological breakthroughs still to be made\u2014some seemingly in the semi-near term, others a little (or a lot) further out. Here are a few things we\u2019re eager to explore further:\n\nThe Hyperloop: No matter how ubiquitous VR may become, there will still be times you have to physically travel from city to city. Planes are fine in some cases. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2018s idea of a system that efficiently shoots hovering pods full of cargo or passengers through a depressurized tube at a pace of up to 700 mph sure sounds appealing. Two companies, Hyperloop Tech and HTT, are already trying to bring this vision to reality, with both now in various stages of building test tracks. Hyperloop Tech seems to be the leader. The company is expected to get nearly $9.2 million in tax incentives from the state of Nevada to help its tests.\n\nHow does the Hyperloop work? Watch:\n\nTricorder: If Walter De Brouwer, CEO of Scanadu, has his way, Star Trek\u2019s Dr. McCoy won\u2019t be the only one with a tricorder medical scanner before too long. Scanadu\u2019s handheld device measures five vital signs in roughly 30 seconds and has raised nearly $50 million in venture capital funding. The device is currently awaiting approval from the Food and Drug Administration with hopes to go on sale later this year. If it lives up to its potential, a real-life tricorder could revolutionize at-home healthcare and how patients interact with their doctors.\n\nCommercial Space Travel: Yep, it\u2019s undeniably cool to experience floating in outer space while wearing a Rift or other VR headset. Games like Adr1ft convey the sense of awesomeness and wonder of being freed from Earth\u2019s gravitational pull. But you know what\u2019s cooler? Actually being out there.\n\nSir Richard Branson is hoping to lead the charge with his commercial space travel outfit, Virgin Galactic. Roughly 700 people have already signed up for the $250,000 rides, plotted to take them 62 miles above the planet and offer a few moments of weightlessness as well as a view of Earth from space. Also in the race for out-of-this-world tourism are Musk\u2019s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin, Paul Allen\u2019s Stratolaunch Systems, and Boeing. Heck, even NASA is booking commercial flights now.\n\nSelf-Driving Cars: Telecommuting may be big now, and it could become even bigger should VR become a common part of mainstream life. Still, plenty of people will still have to make an actual commute to the office.\n\nBut if they could they use that time more efficiently and commute with a higher degree of safety, that\u2019s pretty appealing too. Google, among others, is serious about bringing self-driving cars to the road\u2014and soon. The automotive artificial intelligence was recently qualified as a legal driver by the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration.\n\nFlying Cars: Avery Brooks\u2019s outrage at the lack of flying cars at the beginning of this IBM commercial struck a chord with many viewers.\n\nSure, the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine actor might have backed off the demand for George Jetson\u2019s ride by the end of the spot, but viewers still wanted one.\n\nWe\u2019re still a bit far out on this vehicular advancement, but the dream has wings, nonetheless. The Federal Aviation Administration gave flying car company Terrafugia the green light to start testing its prototypes later this year.\n\nTeleportation: While the tricorder might be within reach, we\u2019ve still got a long way to go on Star Trek\u2018s transporter technology. Yet it may not be quite as impossible as it seems. In 2012, physicists in China reportedly were successful in beaming photons more than 97 kilometers. The downside: zapping physical objects from one place to another is still just a pipe dream.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.\n\nWarp Drive: One of the main staples of any science fiction film is a starship sporting engines propelling it faster than the speed of light. Call it warp speed, hyperdrive, an FTL device\u2014whatever you\u2019d like. (It\u2019s fiction, after all.) But it sure would make exploring the rest of the universe a lot more handy.\n\nThe Internet, on a semi-frequent basis, gets in a tizzy about NASA making advances in this field (as the Internet is wont to do). Once again, the space agency shot down that talk in a statement last year, retorting \u201ctraveling at the speed of light is simply imaginary at present.\u201d That\u2019s not stopping the Tau Zero Foundation, run by a former NASA Glenn Research Center physicist, from seeking advancements in propulsion that would make interstellar flight possible.\n\nTime Machine: The joke among physicists is they\u2019re all waiting for their future selves to come back in time to tell them how to make a time machine. (Oh, those nutty physicists!)\n\nNo joke: one University of Connecticut research professor is seriously trying to make it happen. We\u2019re not going to hold our collective breath, but we will keep our fingers crossed.\n\n(On a final note, while a virtual simulation might be nice, there\u2019s very little that\u2019s not better in reality.)",

    "text": "The standoff between Chicago's Pro Bowl linebacker Lance Briggs and the Bears is officially moving to the next stage.\n\nBriggs was scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent earlier this month but the Bears slapped him with the Franchise tag, which pretty much keeps him as their property for next season at a one-year salary of $7.2 million.\n\nBriggs insists he will not play for a team that will use him for a year and see if he can hold up again rather than reward his two Pro Bowls with a long-term deal.\n\n\"People think I can't afford to sit out the year, I can take out loans to get me through that year just fine because eventually I'll have a deal somewhere,\" he said. \"There are things I can do to make sure I'm fine financially if I sit out.\n\n\"I can also decide what other course of action I can take as the season gets closer. The Bears have shown I'm not in their long-term plans so if that's the case, I don't want to be here.\"\n\nLast week GM Jerry Angelo faced the matter with his unhappy linebacker when he said on a conference call, \"We have his rights, so he's on our football team. We feel that we're treating him very good. That's a lot of money he's making on a one year-deal. The strain really comes to us in terms of our cap and what we have to do for a one-year deal.\n\n\"Most of the times when you franchise a player they don't get traded. We will always listen to anything that we feel will be in our best interest. But when we did this, it was with the intent for him to be a Bear this year.\"\n\nDuring the phone call, another interesting reason for leaving arose. Briggs, who is extremely close with the Bears' star Brian Urlacher, wants to run his own show somewhere and knows it can't happen with No. 54 manning the middle.\n\n\"I've talked to Brian about it,\" said Briggs. \"I'm a competitor and I want the same thing he has. I've learned a lot from Brian as a player and a leader and I eventually want to be 'the man' somewhere. I want to be like him and have everything put on me too. Obviously I'll never be able to do that there.\n\n\"Still, had the Bears made me a long-term offer that I found acceptable, I probably would have sacrificed this desire and stayed. I don't want to be somewhere I'm not wanted long-term.\"\n\nOne of the rotten things about the Franchise tag is that it causes bad blood between players and the team. Briggs has gone from fan-favorite to villain in the course of a month as the always-passionate Chicago fans have taken offense to a guy saying he wants out.\n\n\"I see what the fans are saying and it's tough,\" he said. \"They're angry and I want to be able to explain it myself because I love Chicago. There is a whole city of people angry at me all because I want to know where I'll be able to retire and have job security.\"\n\nUsually in these situations, things get uglier before being resolved. How it moves to the next stage now is anyone's guess.",

Photograph: Matt Sayles/AP/Press Association Images\n\nThe atmosphere was fraught and visceral, and audiences were so close to the action that some were spattered with mud and stage blood. Now Sir Kenneth Branagh is bringing his Macbeth, which was first performed to audiences of just 260 in a deconsecrated Manchester church, to New York. It will be his stage debut in the city.\n\nThe production's 18 performances in Manchester sold out instantly (though were also shown in cinemas as part of the NT Live series, and on a big screen in the city to an alfresco audience of 5,000). It will be reconfigured next June for the Park Avenue Armory Drill Hall, a 55,000 sq ft space with capacity for anywhere between 200 and 5,000 people.\n\nThe production, staged as part of the Manchester international festival in July, received glowing reviews: for the Guardian's Michael Billington, it \"evoked golden memories of Olivier in the role\" ; the New York Times's Ben Brantley said it was, like Branagh's 1980s stage and screen realisation of Henry V, \"a crowd pleaser in the best sense\".\n\nThe play will again be co-directed by Branagh and Rob Ashford, with Alex Kingston as Lady Macbeth. She will also be making her New York stage debut.\n\nSuch was the vigour of the production \u2212 in an interview with the BBC, Branagh warned that \"metal clashes, sparks literally fly\" \u2212 that one cast member was hurt during a fight sequence on stage and taken to hospital as a precaution.\n\nAlex Poots, artistic director of both the Manchester international festival and the Armory, said he was \"thrilled\" that Branagh would be recreating his role in New York. Branagh said: \"Utilising the possibilities of the vast open space is a truly exciting prospect. I am delighted that we have the chance to recreate Macbeth in this epic setting.\"",

    "text": "SAN JUAN DE TEOTIHUAC\u00c1N, Mexico, Sept. 21 - The market in this small town is a warren of streets with canopied stalls and battered storefronts, where one can buy everything from fresh avocados to jeans to a vaquero's saddle.\n\nAs they have for centuries, the merchants here ply their trade midway between the ruins of giant pyramids built by the Maya and the stone steeple of the town's main Catholic church, which Spanish monks founded in 1548.\n\nNow another colossus from a different empire is being built in the shadow of the pyramids, a structure some merchants and other townsfolk here say threatens not only their businesses but their heritage. In December, an ugly cinderblock building rising from the earth is to house a sprawling supermarket called Bodega Aurrera, a subsidiary of Wal-Mart of Mexico.\n\n\"What's next?\" said David Garc\u00eda, 27, whose family owns a dry-goods store in the market. \"It's like having Mickey Mouse on the top of the Pyramid of the Moon.\"\n\nThe 71,902-square-foot store with 236 parking places is about a mile from a gated park where tourists flock to some of Mexico's best-known ruins, a complex of pyramids and other structures built between the fifth and ninth centuries and later called by the Aztecs \"the place where men became gods.\"\n\nHow Wal-Mart got permission to build a superstore on farmland supposedly protected under Mexican law as an archaeological site has vexed the merchants here, who freely accuse the town, the state and the federal Institute of Anthropology and History of corruption.\n\nThe opponents charge Wal-Mart with trampling on their Indian heritage and suggest that the backhoes clawing at the earth on the site are destroying irreplaceable relics.\n\nBut an economic reality underlies this dispute -- Wal-Mart has not only built stores throughout Mexico, but has taken over several other chains. It is the largest private employer in the country, and wherever this American retail titan erects a new outlet, the local merchants tend to disappear, or at least lose business.\n\n\"It's a crime,\" said Irma Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez, 40, who sells chickens in the market. \"They say they will bring 200 jobs. How many people are you going to leave without jobs for those 200?\n\n\"The ruins and us go together. We are part of this culture. They will leave us without work, without anything.\"\n\nNonsense, say state and local officials, who approved the project, as they do most things, without any public hearings. Mayor Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez C\u00e9spedes said there were no more than 20 opponents, people who were afraid of losing business. He points out that Wal-Mart is promising to bring 180 jobs to a town struggling with unemployment. He angrily denounced the grumbling about corruption at City Hall as lies.\n\nArchaeologists at the federal institute also defend their decision to let the project go ahead. True, a small pre-Hispanic altar of clay and stone was discovered under what will be an expansive parking lot, along with a few other artifacts, said S\u00e1nchez Nava, an official with the institute.\n\nBut most of the artifacts have already been recovered from the area where the supermarket is being built. Besides, he said, teams of archaeologists from the institute are at the site each day, watching over the work. \"I don't feel there is a risk,\" he said.\n\nOpponents say the government is misleading people. They say they have found what look like pottery shards, arrows and other relics in the earth excavated from the construction site. They point out that Maribel Mir\u00f3 Flaquer, who approved the project for the institute, resigned shortly afterward. Her successor, Ra\u00fal Javier C\u00f3rdoba Garc\u00eda, died of unknown causes after only a week in office.\n\nAll this has fed the rumor mill on the town's streets, talk of corruption and murder, charges officials call pure fiction. Some compare Wal-Mart's invasion of the pyramid area to the Spanish conquest.\n\nEver since Wal-Mart entered the retail market by taking over Cifra, a Mexican retailer, in 1991, it has gobbled up a greater and greater share of consumer spending. It now owns more than 650 department stores, restaurants and supermarkets in six chains. It rakes in revenues of more than $11 billion a year, greater than the other top three discount retailers combined. In February, it announced plans to open 77 new stores this year and next.\n\nRa\u00fal Arg\u00fcelles, a spokesman for Wal-Mart of Mexico, says the company's only motive for building a store here is to bring lower prices for basic goods to consumers. People here now have to trek 30 miles to the nearest hypermarket, he points out, and pay higher prices in the old-fashioned market. He characterized the protesters, who on one occasion threatened the site with sticks and machetes, as a handful of malcontents. \"The community wants the store,\" he said.\n\nBut the opponents have been joined by some intellectuals, like the poet Homero Aridjis, who in early September intoned that building a shopping center in sight of the pyramids amounted to \"driving the stake of globalization into the heart of Mexican antiquity.\"\n\nEmmanuel D'Herrera, a schoolteacher and former diplomat who lives near the pyramids, said the federal archaeologists relied on surveys to give their approval. He said the construction crews started digging three weeks before government archaeologists arrived, a charge that could not be verified.\n\n\"We see an awful corruption all around that stinks, from INAH to the mayor's office,\" said Mr. D'Herrera, using the acronym for the archaeological institute. \"We want to preserve our heritage. It's not a common piece of land.\"\n\nOthers here are more pragmatic. Francisco Brise\u00f1o has sold cheese, ham, soap, bridles, saddles and other necessities from his tiny shop in the market for 40 years. He does not care much about ancient history. Asked what would happen when the big store opened, he shrugged and said everyone else would lose some business. Still, he has faith in his clientele.\n\n\"I don't think they are going to abandon me,\" he said, smiling broadly, as if to say nothing ever really changes here, even when it does.\n\nTeotihuac\u00e1n Journal Correction: September 30, 2004, Thursday Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about opposition to plans by Wal-Mart's Mexico subsidiary to build a large supermarket near the ancient pyramid ruins of Teotihuac\u00e1n, near Mexico City, referred incorrectly to their origin. While some research suggests a Mayan influence on their architecture, the ethnicity of the builders remains unknown.",

    "text": "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, Mr. Williams has collected his published work and some new poems in a 682-page volume. There can be few binding generalizations of course over such a long and abundant poetical career. Certainly there are poems that are utterly direct, like the rending details in \u201cHelen\u201d of his wife\u2019s illness:\n\nThe next night her cough was worse, with a harsher texture, the spasms came more rapidly,\n\nand they\u2019d end with a deep, complicated emptying, like the whining flattening of a bagpipe.\n\nThe whole event seemed to need more labor: each cough sounded more futile than the last,\n\nas though the effort she\u2019d made and the time lost making it had added to the burden of illness.\n\nThe quotation is an example of Mr. Williams\u2019s most characteristic device: the long-line stanza of six to eight stresses each; one that he uses in perhaps two-thirds of the poems. Its purpose is to include more and leave out less. There is a moral dimension here: He is a poet of indignant compassion for the left-out; one who would say everything that can be said; one who would contain multitudes, like Walt Whitman. It can be powerful, and spaciously beautiful, as in the start of a poem for a sick friend:\n\nThe morning is so gray that the grass is gray and the side of the white horse grazing\n\nis as gray and hard as the harsh, insistent wind gnawing the iron surface of the river.\n\nIt can also be utterly pedestrian:\n\nThe last party before I left was in an old, run-down apartment house, The Greystone Arms,\n\nthe owners of which were involved in a drawn-out legal wrangle with some of the tenants.\n\nNot to leave out, of course, overloads the stanza. As muscles and nerves need pauses to flex, a poem\u2019s line needs silences, ellipses and a shifting rhythmic cadence to nourish its spring. These poems can be read aloud, perhaps, but it\u2019s hard to imagine memorizing and reciting them.\n\nPages after dozens of pages suggest poetic boxcars laden with words trundling along the track. Many of the words are precious (many are not), but their conveyance tends to overpower them. They are apt to show better singly, and if a large collection does them justice in one sense, it may do them injustice in another.\n\nBecause there is so much to be found here. Reviewing any collection inevitably comes down to picking out a few bright examples without suggesting that they are the only or even the brightest ones. In \u201cTantrums\u201d the poet thinks:\n\nSo useful it would be to carry that preemptive howl\n\nalways with you; all the functions it performs,\n\nits equivalents in words are so unwieldy.\n\nIn \u201cSwifts,\u201d the swooping birds \u201cmake folds and pleats in evening\u2019s velvet, and pierce and stitch, dissect, divide.\u201d Writing of a failed poet, fallen into madness, he recalls someone saying, \u201cto make a poem, you first have to invent the poet to make it.\u201d\n\nSome of the shorter and more shapely poems \u2014 a villanelle, for instance \u2014 seem anemic. So, long lines and all, Mr. Williams has supremely invented his poet. As a few poets do, he has created a world: turbulent, craggy and sometimes didactic. And one in which, with a warily agile skip or two among boxcars, a reader can find an explorer\u2019s reward.",

He gave an interested buyer his name, birth date, passport number and money transfer account number to set up the trip.\n\nDespite his clumsiness, Mr. Knowles managed to walk through gaping holes in the email accounts of actors, radio hosts and professional athletes \u2014 illustrating how vulnerable high-profile targets can be, even after damaging episodes like the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment last year.\n\nDigital security experts said on Wednesday that many companies have buttoned up in the wake of incidents like the Sony hacking, leaving employees as the main channels into company data.\n\nSimply clicking on an emailed virus can expose a world of payroll information, for example, or even explicit films.\n\n\u201cIt boils down to the weakest link in the chain,\u201d said Austin Berglas, who is the head of cybersecurity investigations in the United States for the K2 Intelligence firm and a former top agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York. \u201cThat\u2019s how a lot of legitimate companies that spend millions and millions get compromised \u2014 because their weak links are humans.\u201d\n\nMr. Knowles told his interested buyer, who turned out to be an undercover agent, that \u201cgoing after a high-profile celebrity\u201d can be difficult. So, instead, he used what he described as his \u201csocial engineering\u201d process, in which he identified celebrities\u2019 friends through photos and got into the friends\u2019 email accounts to learn about his target, according to the complaint.\n\nSocial media accounts with nothing more than a trace of a celebrity\u2019s private life can set the stage for hacking.\n\n\u201cCelebrities use it to promote their brand,\u201d said Thomas G. A. Brown, a former chief of the computer crimes unit at the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, \u201cbut they may also inadvertently reveal information that can be used to attack them indirectly.\u201d\n\nNone of the victims in the case involving Mr. Knowles have been identified. His trove included scripts for several episodes of a coming season of a popular television drama, the complaint alleged; representatives for HBO, Showtime and FX said they were not aware of their networks\u2019 having been involved.\n\nIn arguing on Tuesday for Mr. Knowles to be detained, Kristy J. Greenberg, a federal prosecutor, said at a hearing, \u201cWe have the defendant\u2019s own admissions on recordings, audio and video recordings, talking about his targeting of various victims, how he would go after them and go after their friends and their loved ones, in order to gain access to their most private matters.\u201d\n\nMr. Knowles\u2019s lawyer, Clay Kaminsky, had no comment on Wednesday.\n\nFor all the discretion Mr. Knowles showed in gaining access to the email accounts and downloading the scripts, which were watermarked with actors\u2019 names, his approach to selling the scripts seemed amateurish. He argued that a buyer \u2014 he contacted a radio host before being led to the undercover agent, according to the criminal complaint \u2014 could package the unpublished scripts and sell them as a book to fans who did not want to wait for a show to air. And when the undercover agent asked for personal information, details of his plot and a meeting in New York, he simply complied.\n\n\u201cI would have asked to be paid in Bitcoins,\u201d Mr. Berglas said. \u201cThere are so many more anonymous ways. The promise of riches clouds, oftentimes, these criminals\u2019 judgments.\u201d\n\nThe case involving Mr. Knowles has not drawn nearly as much attention in entertainment circles as the embarrassing email exchanges divulged in last year\u2019s hacking of Sony, in large part because there is no evidence that the stolen goods got out before his arrest.\n\nJordan Arnold, the head of private client services at K2 Intelligence and a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, cautioned that \u201ca thief is not an honest salesman,\u201d and there was always a chance Mr. Knowles had earlier found another buyer.\n\nHe recalled working on a case as a prosecutor in Manhattan involving a stolen wedding video of Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. The suspects swore to undercover investigators that they would sell them the only copy of the video, he said, only for officials to find after their arrest that they had kept a duplicate.",

If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details here.\n\nQuick Pitch: Wunderlist is an easy-to-use task management tool with online synchronization.\n\nGenius Idea: Web-based and mobile task managers are easy to come by, but all are not created equal, and the good ones usually come with a price tag. Enter wunderlist, a new free task manager for PC, Mac and iPhone that aims to be more flexible than competitors like Things and OmniFocus.\n\nWunderlist is quite simple in purpose and function. Once you fire up the application you can walk through a quick tutorial to get situated with the wunderlist commands and features. Really, though, the application boils down to two key components: Tasks and lists.\n\nType a task, add an optional date and hit enter. You can add tasks to your inbox or to any of the lists you create, and you can drag and drop them to move them about. Tasks can be starred, arranged by date and checked off when completed.\n\nBecause it\u2019s a desktop application, you can update wunderlist while offline and your data will be synced once you\u2019re back online.\n\nThe just-released iPhone application [iTunes link] is nearly an exact replica of the desktop version and sorts tasks by lists, starred, today and overdue. It also includes the same great search functionality of the desktop app, nine background choices and, of course, syncs with your desktop tasks.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s hard to ignore the elegant styling of the desktop and iPhone applications, which marry function with design. We can\u2019t attest to being more productive just yet, but there\u2019s certainly something to be said for an application that looks polished and feels completely frictionless.\n\nWunderlist is the first product from 6 Wunderkinder, a newly founded software shop focused around working and productivity and based out of Berlin. The team is hoping to build a strong fan base with this first release, and designs to use this group to learn more about how people work with tasks and productivity, says CEO and founder Christian Reber.\n\nJust weeks old, wunderlist is already proving to be an early success with productivity types. The product has more than 27,500 users who have created upward of 500,000 tasks.\n\nReber shares that the team is looking for funding right now and that it plans to monetize its service with its next product release \u2014 wunderkit. That product is said to be a productivity platform with business users and collaboration in mind.\n\nImage courtesy of Flickr, adesigna\n\nThe Spark of Genius Series highlights a unique feature of startups and is made possible by sign up today.",

    "text": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- With Kim Jong Un out of sight for a month, three North Korean officials popped down to South Korea for a last-minute visit Saturday.\n\nAnd they delivered a diplomatic bonbon.\n\nThe three officials told South Korea that Pyongyang is willing to hold a new round of high-level meetings between late October and early November, South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement Saturday.\n\n\"Within my memory ... there was never ever such a high-level visit. Never,\" said North Korea analyst Andrei Lankov, from Seoul's Kookmin University.\n\nLankov said two of the three visitors \"are essentially number two and number three in North Korean official hierarchy.\"\n\nRight behind Kim, the \"Dear Leader\" himself.\n\nIs North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lying low?\n\nShort notice, extensive media coverage\n\nIt was a sudden \"charm offensive,\" Lankov said.\n\nAnd it caused a media flurry, with South Korean television network YTN following the delegation's moves via extensive live coverage.\n\nThe three gave Seoul short notice on Friday that they were dropping in officially to attend Saturday's closing ceremonies of the Asian Games in the port city of Incheon.\n\nThe South granted permission the same day to Hwang Pyong-so, vice marshal of the Korean People's Army, Kim Yang-gon and Choe Ryong-hae.\n\nKim Yang-gon is one of North Korea's top politicians responsible for dealings with the South.\n\nChoe is the former head of the military but was replaced in May, triggering some speculation in the international press that he may have fallen out of favor with Kim Jong Un. But South Korean analysts say that he remains extremely influential.\n\nHe holds a seat as secretary on the Workers' Party's Central Committee, Pyongyang's highest decision-making body, and commands preeminent authority over civilian affairs.\n\nChoe is also chairman of the Sports Guidance Commission.\n\nThe officials' Asian Games appearance was followed by a lunch with South Korean officials, and Seoul's reunification minister greeted the North Koreans at their hotel.\n\nThe delegation met with the South's national security chief, Kim Kwan-jin, and later with Prime Minister Chung Hong-won.\n\nKim Jong Un has been conspicuously absent even from important state events, and Pyongyang officials have said Kim is \"suffering from discomfort.\" The last times he was seen publicly, he had gained weight and developed a limp.\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nKim Jong Un and North Korea's military\n\nA labor camp village before ...\n\nAn industrial complex under construction\n\nIndustrial complex operational, two years on\n\nAdministrative compound: Before & after\n\nPhotos North Korea didn't want you to see\n\nPhotos North Korea didn't want you to see\n\nPhotos North Korea didn't want you to see\n\nStanding on bikes to see cyclists\n\nHe missed the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea's Parliament. A prominent seat remained empty onstage, surrounded by North Korea's top brass.\n\nA count of North Korean announcements about Kim's public appearances went from 24 events in July to 16 in August -- then to just one event in September. His last listed public appearance was a September 4 concert.\n\nHis absence has triggered conflicting speculation among longtime North Korea watchers about the security of his position, and on the mechanisms of power in what is arguably the world's most closed society.\n\nJang Jin-Sung, who was a prominent propagandist for Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un's father and predecessor, said the 31-year-old dictator is a merely the \"puppet\" of a shadowy oligarchy.\n\nThe old guard who make up the Organization and Guidance Department (OGD) are the real \"power holders,\" Jang told CNN's Brian Todd via telephone from South Korea on Friday. They were tied closely to the late Kim and are not beholden to his son, he said.\n\nJang, who defected to South Korea almost a decade ago, told Todd that he has spoken with highly placed sources within the regime in recent days. The OGD, he said, \"are calling the shots, and not the words of one man they do not know. Basically, they're no longer loyal to the ruling king's word.\"\n\nNeither CNN nor U.S. intelligence officials can confirm whether Jang's claims are credible, but Ken Gause -- who has studied North Korea for two decades for CNA Corp., a nonprofit agency that provides research and analysis to U.S. government agencies -- agreed that the OGD has enormous clout.\n\n\"It keeps the files on everyone (in the regime's leadership), and that definitely makes it a very powerful and dangerous organization,\" Gause said.\n\nJonathan Pollack, who specializes in East Asian issues for the Brookings Institution, downplayed the likelihood of a power struggle in Pyongyang, telling CNN that high-level maneuvering to influence Kim is much more likely than any effort to strip him of power.\n\n\"This is a top-down system. There is no number two,\" Pollack said. \"It is a royal system, a dynastic system predicated on there being a Kim and then, dare I say, a 'next of Kim' able to wield authoritative power from the top on an unquestioned basis.\"\n\nLankov, the Kookmin University analyst, doubts Kim is in political hot water.\n\n\"People get sick,\" he said. \"I wouldn't make much of it.\"\n\nHe said he believes Kim is still in charge and is behind Saturday's remarkable visit.\n\n\"North Korean diplomacy has been engaged in concerted, well-arranged, well-managed efforts to improve relations with pretty much the entire outside world. And you would not expect it to happen with nobody in control,\" he said.\n\nLankov's take on the reason for North Korea's friendlier approach: economics.\n\n\"They want South Korean money and they want normal trade, which is subsidized by South Korea.\"\n\nIn particular, they'd like the South to lift the so-called May 24 Measure, a heavy trade sanction taken in 2010 after the North Korean military sank a South Korean ship, killing 46 sailors.\n\nIn stark contrast to the bellicose gesturing that has haunted relations in the past, North Korea and South Korea took conciliatory steps in each other's direction in February's first round of high-level talks.\n\nNorth Korea took the initiative in proposing the talks as a measure to build trust. At the meeting, both sides agreed to tone down the harshness of their rhetoric.\n\nPyongyang has been particularly irked by joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States, and would like them to cease. The North views them as a prelude to an invasion.\n\nRoutine military exercises followed later in the same month the first round of talks was held, but were met with less vitriol and military bluster from the North than in the previous year. During joint U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers in 2013, Kim Jong Un flung aggressive threats at both countries and set his military in motion.\n\nFollowing February's talks, South Korea's Unification Ministry proposed a second round in August.\n\nThe North Korean side had not responded to the proposal until Saturday.\n\nCNN's KJ Kwon reported from Seoul, Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Brian Todd, Paula Hancocks, Jason Moon and Cameron Tankersley contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Microsoft has confirmed it cancelled plans to release a Surface Mini tablet in the spring.\n\nDuring Tuesday's quarterly earnings call, CFO Amy Hood said that part of the reason revenue from the company's line of Surface tablets took a hit was because it had decided to kill an unreleased product.\n\n\"During the quarter, we reassessed our product roadmap and decided not to ship a new form factor that was under development,\" Hood said. While she doesn't identify the Surface Mini by name, other reports claimed Microsoft has scrapped plans to release the tablet late in the game, then the company accidentally confirmed the product's existence in a user manual that referenced the Mini directly.\n\nThe decision to take the ax to the Surface Mini was reportedly influenced by CEO Satya Nadella, whose bid to reshape Microsoft includes a clear focus on productivity. While the company has many consumer-facing products (notably Xbox), Windows devices have been criticized as not serving small-screen tablet market as well as iPads and Android models, and market statistics reflect this.\n\nThe small-screen tablet market has grown quickly over the past two years, but Windows didn't support those designs until fall 2013 with the release of Windows 8.1. It appeared inevitable that the Surface line would get a Mini version after that, but since smaller tablets are inherently more about consumption than productivity, such a product wouldn't fit with Nadella's vision of the new Microsoft.\n\nWhen Microsoft held the next Surface product launch in May, it instead announced the Surface Pro 3, a 12-inch tablet that runs full Windows 8.1 Pro, powered by an Intel Core processor.\n\nOther manufacturers have filled the void with small Windows tablets, and most run Windows 8.1, powered by Intel Atom chips. Lenovo was reportedly going to stop selling small Windows tablets in the U.S. due to lack of demand, but the company quickly reaffirmed its commitment to different-size tablets and said it would bring a new small Windows tablet to the American market before the end of 2014.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

    "text": "Mitt Romney\u2019s basic popularity looks more positive after his whisker-close win in the Iowa caucuses, while perceptions of Ron Paul are clearly negative for the first time in ABC News-Washington Post polling.\n\nOn the eve of the New Hampshire primary, 39 percent of Americans hold a favorable opinion of Romney, 34 percent unfavorable; numerically, his best net-positive score in ABC-Post polling since September. Paul, on the other hand, is seen favorably by 31 percent, but unfavorably by 38 percent, his most negative gap.\n\nThe other top scorer in Iowa, Rick Santorum, gets a more even split, but a numerically negative one: 27 percent favorable, 29 percent unfavorable. Many more adults, 44 percent, have yet to form an opinion of him one way or another.\n\nThe ratings matter because favorability is the most basic measure of a public figure\u2019s popularity. An overall positive rating is a key indicator of broad acceptability. This national survey, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, tests the candidates beyond the confines of Iowa, where, out of about 122,000 caucus-goers, Romney and Santorum essentially tied (an eight-vote margin for Romney), with Paul third.\n\nPARTY: Each of these candidates does far better in his own party than more broadly. Among Republicans, 61 percent see Romney favorably, 48 percent Santorum and 40 percent Paul. Their ratings are lower among independents, and far lower among Democrats.\n\nTwo results put Paul at a disadvantage: He\u2019s seen unfavorably by 39 percent of Republicans, essentially no fewer than see him favorably \u2013 in his own party. And Paul also lacks a positive score among independents, the key swing voters in national elections.\n\nSantorum also is on the wrong side of favorability among independents, by a slight 6-point margin. Romney, on one hand, is rated more favorably than unfavorably by independents, by a 7-point margin. But his 61 percent favorable rating among Republicans is a tepid one, even if it beats Paul and Santorum\u2019s scores. President Obama, in an ABC-Post poll last month, had an 82 percent favorable rating among Democrats.\n\nIDEOLOGY: While Romney has had trouble winning support from potential GOP voters who call themselves very conservative, he does have majority popularity \u2013 if not preference \u2013 in this group. His favorability rating is 57 percent among very conservative Republicans and independents, essentially the same as his 58 percent among those who are somewhat conservative.\n\nSantorum matches Romney in popularity among very conservatives, but otherwise Romney is ahead of Santorum and Paul alike in these groups.\n\nOTHERS: There are other differences among groups. Romney\u2019s popularity, for example, peaks among seniors, at 53 percent positive, compared with 29 percent among under-30s. Santorum also does much better with seniors \u2013 45 percent favorable \u2013 than with younger adults.\n\nPaul, by contrast, is most unpopular among adults age 50 and up; 47 percent see him unfavorably, compared with 25 percent of under-30s. Younger adults nationally don\u2019t see Paul more favorably, though; rather, more are undecided. (Young adults were his best age group by far in Iowa.) Paul also is 12 points less popular among women than men.\n\nRomney does well, 47 percent favorable, among adults with household incomes more than $100,000 a year. And his favorability rating is more than 20 points lower among non-whites, 24 percent, than among whites, 45 percent. There are no significant income differences in favorability for Santorum and Paul, and the racial gaps, while present, are smaller.\n\nRomney, finally, has a better favorability rating in the Northeast \u2013 45 percent \u2013 than Santorum (34 percent) or Paul (32 percent). And a certain Northeastern state, of course, is where tonight\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary will be staged.\n\nMETHODOLOGY: This ABC News-Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cell phone Jan. 4-8, 2012, among a random national sample of 1,013 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points. The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by SSRS/Social Science Research Solutions of Media, Pa.",

    "text": "I\u2019m in Ashley Madison\u2019s database. As a journalist who\u2019s written about marriage and social media for sites like YourTango, I signed up after reading a Redbook Magazine article about it to see if I could write a story myself. And frankly, I was intrigued. Really? Eight million folks had signed up to have affairs with neighbors? What brought about that level of marital unhappiness\u2014and secrecy?\n\nAs expected, my inbox instantly flooded with vulgar responses. And then I chickened out. I never messaged anybody and simply logged off. Yet when I read of the leak, I broke into a sweat, not because I\u2019d been on the site, but because of the tidal wave of judgment that was about to hit.\n\nOver my morning cup of coffee, I shared with my conscientious husband that years ago I\u2019d logged in and could be named. He laughed. With that sound, my fear lessened. Because it was sort of funny. He knows who I am but others don\u2019t.\n\nAs a writer, I\u2019ve created quite the digital trail for myself. Over the years I\u2019ve expressed ideas I wish I hadn\u2019t while attempting to push artistic boundaries and thoughts I\u2019ve since grown out of. An idea that may have seemed fresh 20 years ago no longer dies with an obscure journal that goes out of print: it\u2019s still there, ever present. Only now it\u2019s not an idea that\u2019s developed over pages, but one that can be revived in a soundbite that can lead you right in front of the social media firing squad.\n\nHackers say they have posted the personal details of millions of people registered with the adultery website Ashley Madison. But this massive data breach could have widespread implications on how we all use the Internet. The Post's Caitlin Dewey explains. (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)\n\nBut what\u2019s worse for me, a mother, is that in light of the Ashley Madison leak what I regret most isn\u2019t what I\u2019ve written about me, but what I\u2019ve written about my kids. Simple things like e-mails to teachers, school records, texts I sent to friends, or even notes taken by doctors. Because this most recent data leak isn\u2019t about exposing cheaters in my mind, it\u2019s about the digital trail we\u2019ve all created that could be exposed at any moment, one that can be hugely misinterpreted.\n\n[Welcome to the terrifying post-Ashley Madison Internet]\n\nWhen our kids were less than 5 years old, our fears defined who they were. But now, at ages 10, 8 and 6, we get to see what remarkable beings they\u2019re becoming. Our eldest writes skits, our middle can get a cavity filled without Novocaine and our youngest has a better eye than Queer Eye for The Straight Guy.\n\nIn hindsight, I was wrong about a lot of things. As they developed, their narrow interests morphed into passions; their tantrums turned into determination; their overwhelming attention to detail signaled a visual intelligence. And I don\u2019t want my kids locked in time by a digital trail I created which was half wrong. They have a right to evolve, and they have a right to their privacy. As a mother, it pains me to think I may have compromised both.\n\nAs they hit the tween years, they will discover social media is their marketing tool. I hope they understand the online persona they create is not who they are. You can\u2019t come to know yourself through likes. Some of their marketing campaigns will not work. Some will miserably, embarrassingly fail. They may be caught on video doing something stupendously stupid. What price will they pay for taking risks we once dismissed as youthful indiscretions?\n\nOn social media we\u2019re free to judge others by their worst moment, and nobody deserves that. Are 10,000 voices against one ever fair? Is one poorly thought-out tweet worth ruining a life or career over? As Americans, we believe in a fair trial. But, obviously, the Internet does not provide for that.\n\nImagine what the Ashley Madison leak may do to some people. I\u2019m lucky to have escaped fallout, thanks to a trusting and loving husband. What of others in my situation? And what about our kids when they make a mistake online? Or not even a mistake, but do something misguided? Because all kids do. But now, there\u2019s proof forever.\n\nWe teach our children to stand up to bullies. We don\u2019t tolerate them in the classroom, and yet we become them online. We need to help our kids learn to use words both offline and on to help the situation, not hurt it. And most important, to always be kind, because words are way more powerful \u2014 and permanent \u2014 than we may know.\n\nJennifer Jeanne Patterson is the author of 52 Fights: A Newlywed\u2019s Confession.

'Guys, you're never going to see a sex tape from me. It's not gonna happen.\"\n\n, Jenner ponders speculation that she secretly has a bun in the oven.\n\n\"Why is everyone saying that I'm pregnant,\" she asked while scrolling through her phone.\n\n\"Who's the dad?\" Jenner's sister Kourtney jokingly said in response.\n\n\"I don't know. How do people know before me?\" Jenner retorted.\n\nThe masses love to create drama where there is none, and Kardashian-Jenner drama is some of the most oft-fictionalized kind. So it came as no surprise when spectators decided to\n\nbetween longtime queen bee Kim Kardashian West and rising star Jenner.\n\nJenner, of course, was having none of it. \"People always put me and Kim in a competition, or [they say] I'm trying to be Kim, or I'm trying to steal Kim's throne,\" Jenner said in a video called 'Sister Love' on her website. \"I think people forget that me and Kim are sisters.

Everyone is obsessed with that.

No surgery,\" she said in a video.\n\nCommenters insisted Jenner had been increasing the size of her already famously-plump lips, so the star stepped up and revealed the real reason why her lips sometimes look a little extra pouty.\n\n\"Everyone thinks I keep making my lips bigger but, this is them normally,\" she said in a Snapchat video, \"and then this is them when I push them out, do my little face,\" she continued in the next video, puckering her lips slightly. Mystery solved.\n\nIt seems Jenner never gets a rest from baby talk.\n\nIn February 2016, she teamed-up with then-boyfriend Tyga to\n\n\"Are you pregnant?\" the rapper jokingly asked Jenner in a Snapchat video. \"I think we need to address that rumor because I feel like everybody thinks you're pregnant and there's a new story every day about you being pregnant and being married and all this crazy stuff so you need to talk about those type of things.\"\n\n\"I'm not pregnant and I'm not married,\" she responded, \" 'Cause you're slacking \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I'm just kidding.\"\n\n\"Because I'm a f---ing infant child and I don't want to be married or have a baby right now!\" she added.",

    "text": "\"I'm fed up with the Jewish conversation just being about Israel or antisemitism,\" says Raymond Simonson, sitting in a meeting room with floor-to-ceiling windows, overlooking Finchley Road in northwest London. \"I want to talk about Curb Your Enthusiasm instead, and the paintings of Chagall, the music of Amy Winehouse and Woody Allen films.\"\n\nWith thick glasses, substantial sideburns and a brown tweed jacket that give him the look of someone fresh from a Woody Allen film set, Simonson is the chief executive of a new multimillion pound complex that aims to provide a home for all of the above.\n\nHovering like a low-slung liner, its long ribbons of windows separated by crisp bands of white concrete, JW3 (a riff on its home in NW3) declares itself to be \"a new postcode for Jewish life\" \u2013 with not a Torah or menorah in sight. Set to open at the end of September after 10 years in the making, it is the brainchild of Vivien Duffield, whose Clore Duffield Foundation stumped up \u00a340m of the \u00a350m project cost. It was inspired by her visit to the vast Jewish Community Centre (JCC) in New York, a multi-storey beacon of Jewish culture in Manhattan that made her wonder why London didn't have the same.\n\n\"If you go to the States, Jewish stuff is loud and proud,\" says Simonson. \"But over here it's completely different. Indoors, we might shout at each other around the dinner table, smash glasses at our weddings and do boisterous dancing, but outside you keep your head down. Of course we know why it's like that in Europe \u2013 my mum escaped Nazi-occupied France \u2013 but we shouldn't still be scared of that shadow.\"\n\nWhile New York's look-at-me JCC seems like a slick private club, complete with a flashy sixth-floor swimming pool, London's version speaks more softly. Set back from the roaring six-lane traffic on Finchley Road on a sloping site, accessed from a bridge that crosses a large sunken courtyard, its four storeys only read as two from street level. Designed by Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands, purveyors of inoffensive modernism-lite, it is dressed in understated beige, brick and reconstituted stone. It is trying to be the Savile Row to the loud Wall Street pinstripe \u2013 but it comes off looking a bit M&S.\n\n\"We knew we couldn't just plonk the JCC down here,\" says Nick Viner, JW3's outgoing CEO who has steered the project since the beginning. He cites Hugh Casson's Ismaili Centre in South Kensington and Denys Lasdun's Royal College of Physicians by Regent's Park as projects he was keen to emulate. Both contain a series of auditoriums and rooms arranged around large public levels and atriums. Both are also wrapped in fortified shells, standing like cultural castles ready to defend against an oncoming siege.\n\nBy contrast, Viner wanted JW3 to have \"an open civic quality, not look like an exclusive club,\" though this is not particularly evident from the street. The bridge, accessed through a big metal gate, reinforces the sense of a secure site, while a giant glass fence marches along the pavement, allowing passers-by to look down on activities in the sunken piazza \u2013 an us-and-them relationship with unfortunate connotations of a zoo enclosure. The whole thing is towered over by a nine-storey block of swish apartments, a necessary planning condition, replacing the same number of homes that were on the site before.\n\nThe fact that the building looks like an embassy should not come as a surprise: it is intended as something of a Jewish cultural ambassador. Within its relatively small footprint, it somehow contains a 270-seat auditorium, a 60-seat cinema, a restaurant and bar, a demonstration kitchen, dance studios, classrooms and medical clinics. This leisure sandwich is even topped off by a penthouse nursery with a ziggurat of ball pools and sandpits on its own roof terrace. It is the kind of ambitious hybrid offspring that might be produced if an academy school had a lovechild with the Barbican.\n\n\"We would like to be mentioned in the same sentence as the Barbican,\" confirms Viner, \"along with the Southbank Centre, or the Roundhouse or Rich Mix.\" With the Camden Arts Centre across the road, he hopes JW3 will lead to an \"emerging arts hub\" in this corner of Hampstead.\n\nThe bar is set high, and with 1,300 events scheduled for the opening three months, the programming team has a lot to live up to. Simonson points out that this only equates to two events per day in each space \u2013 \"we wanted to start light\" \u2013 but the calendar is already brimming with celebrity appearances, from evenings with Kevin Spacey and Nicholas Hytner to Ruby Wax and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker. The courtyard will become a mini-farm in the opening weeks and an ice rink over the winter, while upstairs in the classrooms there are courses on Hebrew lettering and henna body-painting, kosher cooking classes and lessons in Krav Maga \u2013 the lethal martial art taught to the Israeli Defence Force. But not everything is on-theme: \"If you come for watercolour classes, it's not Jewish watercolours,\" says Simonson. \"We won't make you sit there and paint gefilte fish.\"\n\nBeing in Hampstead, the centre has a guaranteed catchment and builds on a strong history of cultural life in the area. It is just down the road from the home of Habonim, AKA the \"Socialist Zionist Culturally Jewish youth movement,\" a group where Mike Leigh, Sacha Baron Cohen and David Baddiel started out telling jokes. In their honour, JW3 will host a Jewish comedy club called HavaNaGiggle, plus a comedy class for pensioners \u2013 \"standup for the sit-down age group\" as Simonson has christened it.\n\nJW3 is at pains to point out that it is not a religious centre. It may have the largest Shabbat-compliant lift outside Israel \u2013 programmed to function automatically on a Saturday, stopping at every floor \u2013 but there is nothing expressly Jewish about the building. \"I hope people that might never think of going to a synagogue will come here,\" says Simonson, adding that the programme should appeal to the new kind of \"three-days-a-year Jew\".\n\n\"That used to mean going to the synagogue on our three holiest days,\" he says, \"but now there is a generation that might go to the Jewish Film festival, Jewish Book Week and Limmud, a sort of Jewish Edinburgh festival. The idea of JW3 is to have this festival 52 weeks a year, open to everyone.\" With an energetic director at the helm, and a long list of wealthy benefactors, the centre has every hope of adding another dimension to London's vibrant cultural life \u2013 just as long as it can lure people past the fences and across the bridge.",

    "text": "What does your personal budget look like? If you've never put cursor to spreadsheet to figure that out, the flagging economy may soon force your hand. If you have, and are dismayed by the data, you might want to think hard about where those precious dollars are going--and why.\n\nFor some valuable perspective (and perhaps belt-tightening inspiration), take a look at global consumer-spending patterns. Data from the World Bank's most recent and hugely comprehensive International Comparison Program study breaks global individual consumption into 11 buckets--from food and clothing to health care and recreation.\n\nForbes.com took a snapshot of overall allocations for 18 countries, measured as percentages of total individual consumption (rounded to the nearest percent). While the figures capture patterns as of 2005, recent inflation in energy and food prices no doubt has shifted these results a bit.\n\nThe most striking--and downright shocking--data are the disparities in the relative chunks of income that go toward food and drink. Impoverished denizens of Ethiopia and Egypt, for example, spend an estimated 55% and 43% of their incomes, respectively, on food and non-alcoholic beverages (excluding purchases made at restaurants, bars, hotels and the like). Americans and Canadians: just 6% and 8%.\n\nOn a happier note, Russians and Croatians clearly like to party: They set aside 6% and 5% of their budgets for booze, tobacco and narcotics, more than the rest of the countries on our list, while Saudi Arabians' conservative intake barely registers in the numbers.\n\nRussians also spend freely on clothing and footwear, which gobble 9% of their outlays, versus just 4% for ostensibly hungry U.S. consumers. One reason for the disparity: the flood of artificially inexpensive imports to the U.S. from China.\n\nWhat Russians don't seem to be shelling out for is shelter and power--the combination of housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels merits just 9% of Russians' overall consumption--thanks in part to lingering Soviet-era subsidies. Turkish consumers, who enjoy few subsidies while suffering high taxes, spend 24% of their incomes on these necessities, the highest of the bunch.\n\nLittle surprise that U.S. consumers, long strapped by a sadly inefficient health care system, allot the highest percentage of their budgets--a whopping 18%--to medical care; meanwhile, Brazil, Russia, India and China (known by economists as the BRIC countries) shell out just 8%. For the complete World Bank comparison report, click here.\n\nNext, we took a closer look at how Americans spend their gradually shrinking discretionary dollars (as opposed to money spent on necessities like food, housing and utilities). This more recent data--courtesy of Spending Pulse, the economic research arm of MasterCard (nyse: MA - news - people ) WorldWide--divides U.S. consumer discretionary spending into eight buckets: air travel, e-commerce, electronics, furniture, lodging (as in hotels, not primary residences), apparel, luxury (excluding jewelry) and restaurants.\n\nThe deepest bucket by far: restaurants. In 2007, U.S. consumers spent $390 billion at eateries, representing nearly 43% of their overall discretionary spending. Electronics, at $141 billion, or 15.5% of discretionary dollars, came in second, followed by furniture and apparel.\n\nIn the last three years, the relative dollar-split among all eight buckets hasn't changed much. The most dramatic year-over-year downward shift--nearly a full percentage point--came in the furniture category, which accounted for $113 billion, or 12.4% of discretionary spending in 2007, a year which saw home foreclosures jump 79% from 2006.\n\nStill feeling bad about your budget? Keep this in mind: Last year, U.S. consumers spent $907 billion on discretionary items. That's roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product of Australia, the 14th richest country in the world.\n\nIn a recession, it's hard to remember that everything is relative.",

    "text": "SHOW DOWN | A Dries Van Noten top and skirt holds its ground against a natural-born preener.\n\nPhoto Details: Dries Van Noten Top, $1,750, Skirt, $1,785, and Shirt, $665, IF Soho, 212-334-4964; Catbird Rings, between $44 and $1,260, catbirdnyc.com; Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane Rings, $3,700 and $2,500, Saint Laurent, 212-980-2970; Manolo Blahnik Heels, $595, Bergdorf Goodman, 212-753-7300; C\u00e9line Bag, $2,800, Barneys, 212-826-8900\n\nTHE LAST TIME I wore feathers\u2014four years ago\u2014it was a wedding gift of sorts for one of my best friends. Not only does the bride work in fashion, she loves and lives it. I should also mention that the date of the reception happened to be Halloween. A run-of-the-mill LBD was no more an option than gym clothes.\n\nThis was an occasion that called for sartorial festivity and a soup\u00e7on of drama. In other words: a perfect moment for feathers. I arrived in a one-shoulder cocktail frock with a black silk bodice that exploded into a skirt of black and cream ostrich. It felt suitably special\u2014a dress that all but commands its wearer to have a fantastic time in it. I did. And the bride was suitably appreciative of the effort.\n\nI have worn nary a plume since because I don't quite consider myself a feather girl. Feathers can be weighty with connotation. They evoke an over-the-top glamour that makes you think of old Hollywood, Vegas showgirls or figure skaters. Wallflowers, or even just women like myself who favor simpler and subtler clothes, need not apply.\n\nHowever, as I sat at Dries Van Noten's fall show a few months ago, the concept of wearing feathers gently floated about and stuck a perfect 10 landing. Mr. Van Noten\u2014who had only before used feathers on a very small scale\u2014boiled away any potential froth by introducing a casual, even mannish edge. These were feathers that almost passed as \"this old thing.\" Think fluffy feather tops worn with creased wide wool trousers and flat lace-up oxfords. Think Prince of Wales tweeds dotted with plumes.\n\nA brief guide to the season's most popular plumage.\n\nRooster, seen in Louis Vuitton's fall collection, is far less fluffy than ostrich. It's what the storied Parisian feather atelier Lemari\u00e9 uses for a plainer look, said managing director Nadine Dufat.\n\nEven in its natural state, pheasant, seen at Christopher Kane, offers a wide variety of colors, said Ms. Dufat.\n\nMost common of the fashion feathers, ostrich, said Ms. Dufat, also has a nice natural shine. Seen at Dries Van Noten and many, many more fall shows.\n\nThis flatter feather, said Ms. Dufat, adds less volume. Seen at Christopher Kane.\n\nThe designer's inspiration was the 1935 film \"Top Hat,\" which starred Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. But he said he envisioned each look as Fred and Ginger synchronized into a single being, much like the way they danced. He called it a \"mitigated, understated glamour,\" more in line with his Belgian sensibility than your average feather look.\n\n\"It's not so twee,\" said Laura Vinroot Poole, owner of the boutique Capitol in Charlotte, N.C., of Mr. Van Noten's show. \"It was this collision of flou [the soft, non-tailored department of an atelier] and hard-edge menswear. It was just beautiful.\"\n\nIn truth, feathers positively flew through a good number of the fall collections. (\"Ostriches should be scared,\" joked one designer.) It's hard to explain why. It seemed to be one of those things that's just in the air (as feathers are). Mr. Van Noten was one of a few designers that proposed a new approach to the age-old embellishment. At Louis Vuitton, duck plumes\u2014formed into delicate, velvety flowers\u2014decorated pretty tea dresses, while heavy, belted wool coats dissolved into a wild hem of ostrich. New York duo Proenza Schouler showed multicolored feather skirts that might have turned Norma Desmond's head had they not been grounded with hefty ombre crew-neck sweaters.\n\nLondon-based designer Erdem Moralioglu worked with feathers for the first time in his eight-year career. Into a dark and elegant tweed he wove strips of ostrich feathers, which he then pulled free at the ends to fly about. Elsewhere, he shrouded a ballet-slipper-pink feather dress in black organza. \"I was thinking about this Hitchcock heroine,\" said Mr. Moralioglu. \"I love the idea of it being kind of twisted. It all felt right in a slightly wrong way.\"\n\nAnother young Londoner, Christopher Kane, trimmed the seams of satin dresses with dyed pheasant feathers for what he called a \"fuzzy silhouette that flattered the wearer.\" Mr. Kane also appliqu\u00e9d the front of a slouchy charcoal gray cashmere sweater\u2014the kind that would typically hit heavy rotation in your weekend wardrobe\u2014in navy, gray and wine flowers crafted from pheasant feathers. \"I didn't want the garments to feel delicate,\" said Mr. Kane, \"but tough and strong.\" He suggested pairing feather sweaters or skirts with flat boots and simple shirts for a look that's \"modern and carefree.\"\n\nWith a price tag of more than $4,000 for the above-mentioned sweater, it's a pretty decadent way to feel breezy. Still, Mr. Kane brings us to a very relevant question about this new breed of plumes: Can you wear feathers during the day?\n\n\"Well first, where do you work?\" asked Capitol boutique's Ms. Poole, with a hearty laugh. But she continued, \"You could put a white menswear shirt under that Dries [Prince of Wales] tunic and wear it with jeans.\" Ms. Poole noted that her clientele might be motivated to sport feathers around the clock. \"Postrecession, women really want to find a way to wear things more often,\" she said. \"It's not just about one gala evening.\" The easiest way to incorporate feathers into the weekday wardrobe is with separates\u2014tops and skirts\u2014that can be easily tempered by more basic fare.\n\nBarneys New York fashion director Tomoko Ogura reported that the store was selling lots of sleek feather peplum tops by Los Angeles-based brand Co. \"I think people are wearing [the top] with leather leggings or jeans,\" said Ms. Ogura. \"It's not something that's treated as preciously as you might think.\" Mr. Van Noten is selling a black ostrich top ($1,565) backed in silk that could easily get mileage for years, a bit daring, but doable for day and just right for evening hours. It's one that I, as a freshly minted feather convert, could easily envision wearing to pieces\u2014not the least because feathers, though a bit flamboyant, are still comfortably light as a you-know-what. You can't say the same for something similarly elaborate that's heavily beaded. \"There's an airiness to these pieces,\" said Ms. Ogura. \"It doesn't feel like that blingy holiday thing.\"\n\nInveterate feather fanatics Beth Buccini and Sarah Easley, co-owners of New York boutique Kirna Zab\u00eate, wondered if feathers could be headed down the same path to ubiquity as leopard prints or sequins\u2014elements that were once glamorously exotic, but are now, as Ms. Buccini put it, \"like beige.\"\n\n\"I think the lack of durability is going to be the savior for feathers,\" said Ms. Easley. \"You won't ever be popping on your feather coat after the gym.\" Still, they are stocking a few things that could easily see the light of day, like a Lanvin sweatshirt ($1,690) with a ruff of ostrich in the shape of a butterfly. They also offer some fetching accessories, like a slim black leather belt from Nina Ricci that sprouts feathers at either side.\n\nAs for the feather's fragility, it's a topic that not everyone agrees on. \"Buyers in the showroom were surprised how tough [feathers] are,\" said Mr. Kane. \"People think they're delicate but they're very resilient and tactile.\"\n\nStill, no one would tell you to send your feathery frocks anywhere but an accredited specialist dry cleaner. As a bonus service to her clientele, Ms. Poole said she sends a box up twice a week to New York dry cleaner extraordinaire Madame Paulette with feather pieces and other clothes that require a gentle and skilled hand. \"At that level, you don't want to take any chances,\" Ms. Poole said.\n\nBut the big question remains: Why did feathers appear en masse this season\u2014making fashion editors feel a bit like Tippi Hedren noticing one, two, three and then hundreds of birds? Perhaps, after the industry's obsession with fur, it's the next step deeper into the world of fauna. \"I think designers like feathers because there are so many different possibilities with them,\" said Nadine Dufat, the managing director of Parisian feather atelier Lemari\u00e9, which produced Louis Vuitton's fall plumes, and does fantastical work for the haute couture collections of Chanel and Dior. Certainly the 133-year-old plumassier can make magic happen when it comes to all things avian, but no matter who's doing your feather work, there's something about plumes that's fascinating and otherworldly and therein lies the allure\u2014eternal for some, fleeting for others.\n\nA cozy feather cashmere sweater\n\nClockwise from left: Jeans, $208, currentelliott.com; Christopher Kane Feather Cashmere Sweater, $4,295, net-a-porter.com; The Row Sunglasses, $457, mytheresa.com; Constance Cartable bag, $11,400, Herm\u00e8s, 800-441-4488; Driving Shoes, $425, Tod's, 212-644-5945\n\nAn elegant feather-woven tweed shift\n\nClockwise from left: Dress, $4,240, Erdem, 4420-7739-7986; Aquazzura Pumps, $725, forwardbyelysewalker.com; Aur\u00e9lie Bidermann Pearl Earrings, $190, Barneys, 212-826-8900; Bottega Veneta Jacket, $3,480, net-a-porter.com; Givenchy by Riccardo Tisci Clutch, $3,595, Neiman Marcus, 212-840-1200\n\nA wing-ding of a skirt\n\nClockwise from left: Shirt, $70, jcrew.com; Tank Solo, $2,880, Cartier, 800-227-8437; Ostrich Skirt, $14,200, Proenza Schouler, 212-585-3200; Bag, $2,895, Giorgio Armani, 212-988-9191; Necklace, $1,220, David Yurman, 212-752-4255; Pumps, $585, rupertsanderson.com\n\nA version of this article appeared September 7, 2013, on page D1 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: MakeFriendsWithFeathers.",

    "text": "The propaganda poster is one of the most iconic in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Based on a painting by Liu Chunhua commissioned during the Cultural Revolution, it marks the moment in 1922 when Mao Zedong and other young communists helped organize a historic strike among miners in China\u2019s coal country. The poster, called Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan, shows a youthful man striding forward with socialist purpose to save the downtrodden masses. Even now, the image symbolizes the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s revolutionary zeal, much like the image of George Washington crossing the Delaware evokes the struggle for American independence.\n\nToday, coal is still unearthed from the same hills of Jiangxi province. The city of Pingxiang, which includes the Anyuan district of Mao fame, is home to eight state-run coal mines. But only three are operational; the rest are victims of a global coal glut and a slackening Chinese economy. Thousands of idled miners were offered little more than $70 a month in salary earlier this year, on top of a series of wage cuts last year. Inspired by the Great Strike of 1922, hundreds of miners rallied on Feb. 29 and March 1 \u2014 a dangerous action in a nation where mass movements can lead to mass arrests. \u201cWe wanted to say that this money is not even enough for food,\u201d says one protester, Zhong Yifeng. \u201cHow can you survive on such little money?\u201d\n\nEven though participants said they only held up signs peacefully, armed police were dispatched to break up the protest. (On its website, Pingxiang Mining Industry Group acknowledged that workers had gathered at its offices to \u201cexpress their mass demands.\u201d) Several protesters were injured in scuffles, say participants. But the miners are not cowed. If compensation isn\u2019t increased significantly, some Pingxiang miners are considering more drastic means. \u201cWe may go petition in Beijing, shouting, \u2018We must eat to survive\u2019 in Tiananmen Square,\u201d says Xiao Bin, another miner who took part in the protests. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, but it\u2019s just like Mao\u2019s Anyuan strike, when the workers carried out revolution.\u201d\n\nStrikes are illegal in today\u2019s China, as are any independent unions outside the party structure. Mass protests are also taboo. For decades, security forces, employed by a ruling Communist Party obsessed with maintaining social stability, made sure to break up any incipient labor movement. But with China\u2019s economy slowing after years of double-digit growth, the nation\u2019s workers see little option apart from taking to the streets \u2014 even at the risk of arrest.\n\nSocial unrest has spread nationwide. In the nation\u2019s south, the cradle of China\u2019s export-led economy, rarely a day goes by without workers at private factories engaging in civil action. High-profile labor activists have been thrown in jail. State-sector laborers, who contribute around 40% of China\u2019s industrial output, have also raised protest signs, particularly in the nation\u2019s northeastern rust belt. In just one example last month, thousands of state coal miners in a city on the Chinese-Russian border, rallied in March after the provincial governor incorrectly announced in Beijing that they had been paid their back wages. Overall, 2,774 strikes and protests erupted across the country last year, more than double the figure for 2014, according to the China Labor Bulletin, a Hong Kong\u2013based watchdog.\n\nLabor discontent is particularly acute in the state-run coal and steel industries. In February, state planners said China would shed 1.8 million jobs from these two sectors, which are notoriously inefficient and indebted. Reforms designed to tackle China\u2019s worrisome overcapacity aren\u2019t a bad thing, especially when President Xi Jinping\u2019s government has, in general, tightened the state\u2019s hold on the economy rather than loosening it and promoting private enterprise. But unlike the 1990s, when 30 million Chinese lost their state-sector employment, it\u2019s not clear how China\u2019s slowing economy will absorb this new wave of laid-off workers.\n\nEarlier this month, Pingxiang Mining Industry Group finally gave miners $125 in back pay for the month of February. That\u2019s better than $70 but still less than half of what workers once earned. The local public security bureau has posted signs warning those in the mining industry to \u201cmaintain social order\u201d and \u201csecure stability\u201d in the mines. On its own website, Pingxiang Mining noted that, in the weeks since the protest, authorities \u201ctook many measures to maintain harmony and stability in the mines [including sending] capable people with arms to patrol around the key areas, collecting information on instability and solving conflicts and disputes.\u201d (TIME was unable to get comment from Pingxiang Mining since no one answered their phones.)\n\nLike hundreds of cities across interior China, Pingxiang is undergoing a building boom that underscores the nation\u2019s growing income gap. On the outskirts of this coal town, miners live in unheated, cement-block shantytowns. Coal miner Xiao, 37, is the third generation of his family to work the mines. His grandfather died in a mining accident, his father of occupational lung disease. He has a Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan poster decorating his Spartan home, where tap water runs black when it runs at all.\n\nBut elsewhere in Pingxiang, local officials have constructed grandiose, mostly empty museums that are being touted as integral to a red-tourism trail dedicated to China\u2019s communist history. An outdoor movie studio, built by a coal boss, takes up prime real estate, even if locals say it has never attracted a single film or TV crew. Downtown, new luxury residences have sprouted, with glittering chandeliers and gilded fixtures. In a poster affixed to one such residential tower, a local real estate company uses an iconic image in an advertisement. It\u2019s a famous portrait but it\u2019s not of a certain Anyuan strike organizer. Instead, Uncle Sam, that embodiment of American patriotism, looms over a city made famous by Chairman Mao.\n\n\u2014 With reporting by Yang Siqi / Pingxiang",

    "text": "It was the bottom of the fifth inning and the 0-1 pitch was on its way, and the next sound you heard at Fenway Park was the deep thwack of a well-struck baseball. It was hit by Red Sox outfielder Shane Victorino, a line drive heading straight up the middle, toward the big man on the mound, a pitcher disguised in a small forward\u2019s body.\n\nSomehow, in the milliseconds it took for the ball to arrive, Brandon McCarthy\u2019s mind raced at a pace equal to the ball, the thoughts loaded with dread and disbelief: No, this can\u2019t be happening. No way.\n\nVictorino\u2019s shot came last Aug. 4, on a sunny Sunday against the Diamondbacks, McCarthy\u2019s club before he was traded to the Yankees last week. It also came just 11 months after the 6-7, 200-pound McCarthy was on the receiving end of an infinitely more horrific thwack, after he got drilled by a shot off the bat of the Angels\u2019 Erick Aybar while pitching for the Oakland A\u2019s. The date was Sept. 5, 2012, in the fourth inning in Oakland amid the heat of a pennant race, and it was as nasty a head blow as a pitcher has sustained in recent memory, one that resulted in a fractured skull, a brain contusion and an epidural hemorrhage, the trauma requiring potentially life-saving brain surgery later that night.\n\nAnd now, in his first start back from the disabled list, a month after he suffered a seizure in a Phoenix restaurant, Brandon McCarthy was seeing another baseball rocketing toward his head at 100 or so mph.\n\n\u201cThe one (Victorino) hit back at me missed the same spot by about a quarter-inch,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cThat screwed me up for a little while, just because it makes it very real again. To that point, I hadn\u2019t really considered it. (But) there\u2019s some subconscious thought that just exists, just like if you get into a car accident or anything, once your brain has a negative outcome tied to something, it exists there.\u201d\n\nBrandon McCarthy, a 31-year-old from Colorado, is one of baseball\u2019s more unguarded and thoughtful souls, and one of its leading Twitter humorists, often going back and forth with his wife, Amanda. When he returned home after the Aybar beaning, he tweeted, \u201cWELL IF BEING DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL ISNT THE BEST TIME TO ASK ABOUT A THREESOME THEN IM FRESH OUT OF IDEAS.\u201d\n\nShortly after McCarthy collapsed his long body just in time to avoid being nailed by Victorino\u2019s missile, Amanda tweeted:\n\n\u201cIf you would have ducked like that last year you would only have like 50,000 twitter followers.\u201d\n\nNow on his fifth major-league team, McCarthy has a career record of 45-60, with a 4.19 ERA. He never set out to be the poster boy for the perils of pitching, but then, he never expected to be hit, either. No pitcher does. Not Herb Score, the brilliant young Indians lefthander who was never the same after being hit by a line drive off the bat of the Yankees\u2019 Gil MacDougald in 1957. Not the Blue Jays\u2019 J.A. Happ, who was skulled by the Tampa Bay Rays\u2019 Desmond Jennings last May, or Jennings\u2019 teammate, Alex Cobb, who was hit by a drive by the Royals\u2019 Eric Hosmer last June.\n\n\u201cWe always feel we\u2019ll be able to get out of the way,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cI was definitely one of those guys. Maybe we just talk ourselves into that \u2014 that we\u2019re quick enough and our hands are good enough and that it just (won\u2019t happen) to us.\u201d\n\nWith the fresh and chilling images of a spate of recent incidents \u2014 don\u2019t forget the Reds\u2019 Aroldis Chapman getting crushed in the left eye in spring training by a rocket hit by the Royals\u2019 Salvador Perez \u2014 the issue of pitcher safety is commanding more attention than ever before, all the more so with the Padres\u2019 Alex Torres recently becoming the first big-league pitcher to wear a protective hat in a game. Torres, then with the Rays, came on in relief of Cobb the day he was hit, and has never forgotten. Ron Darling, for one, thinks the alarm and new-found vigilance is a good thing.\n\nDarling never got hit in the head with a batted ball, but he did get a major scare in Montreal once, losing a shot off the bat of Tim Raines in the yellow seats behind home plate at Olympic Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt was the only ball in my whole career that I didn\u2019t see, and it scared me,\u201d Darling says. The ball hit him in the chest. The next pitch he threw, he said he recoiled as the batter swung \u2014 another career-first. And then he said the urge to recoil passed, Darling attributing it to the same blind confidence Cobb spoke of.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complete hubris,\u201d Darling says. \u201cYou have that DNA, that gene, that says, \u2018Well, I could\u2019ve fallen out of the window, but I didn\u2019t, so bleep you.\u2019 There\u2019s a real Darwinism or macho thing to it . . . where (you think), \u2018I\u2019m more powerful than you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt will take a lot to penetrate the hubris, Darling says, but it must happen. Players are bigger, and stronger, he said. The latest generation of pitchers often does not work on its fielding as much as pitchers once did, so it makes them less proficient as defenders, though in the most frightening of instances, even Ozzie Smith could not get his glove on a liner back to the mound. Indeed, the ball that hit Cobb was clocked at 102.4 mph.\n\nSays Darling, \u201cIf you take an infielder \u2014 say David Wright \u2014 and you asked him to come over here and stand sideways, 55 feet from home plate, and then said, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m going to give a guy a fungo bat and hit the ball at you as hard as he can\u2019 \u2014 there is no way he would do it. Nobody would do it.\u201d And for a very good reason.\n\nWhen you put all of your exertion into a pitch and fire toward home plate, even if you have the mechanics and polish of Greg Maddux, you are a proverbial sitting duck.\n\nOr as Zack Wheeler of the Mets says, \u201cEvery pitcher has been hit somewhere at some time.\u201d\n\nIt was six months ago that the special hat worn by Alex Torres received official approval by MLB. It\u2019s called the isoBLOX Protective Cap, and only after it met the MLB-mandated standards \u2014 offering protection against baseballs traveling at least 83 mph \u2014 did it pass muster. The big-league cap, according to Bruce Foster, CEO of 4LicensingCorp., the parent company of isoBLOX, is rated for 85 mph in the temple region, and 90 mph in the forehead. The protection comes from padding the company describes as hexagon-shaped \u201cplastic injection molded polymers combined with a foam substrate\u201d that is designed to diffuse impact through both absorption and dispersion. The same technology is used in an isoBLOX skull cap that the company is marketing to youth players; that product fits beneath a regular cap, and is available at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods for $59.99.\n\nThe big-league caps are about a half-inch thicker in the front than a regular cap, and about three-quarters of an inch thicker in the sides, and weigh about seven extra ounces. Foster says that about 60 big-league pitchers have ordered them, though only Torres is using them in games, for reasons both pragmatic and aesthetic. To many, Torres looked as if he\u2019d stumbled off the set of E.T.\n\nFormer Met R.A. Dickey tried it in spring training and found it heavy and unwieldy. Current Met Dillon Gee has never tried it, and doesn\u2019t plan to. \u201cI just don\u2019t like the way it looks,\u201d Gee says. \u201cIt looks uncomfortable, looks heavier. I never even really thought about wearing it.\u201d\n\nYou would think that pitchers such as Cobb and McCarthy would be the first to sign on, but neither has.\n\nCobb is a spokesman for isoBLOX, endorsing the use of the skull cap for all youth players. But when you see him on the mound for the Rays, you will see him in a regular Rays cap, not the specially designed model with the padding stitched in by New Era.\n\n\u201cThe most obvious guy who should be out there wearing it would be me, but right now it\u2019s just not suited to my high-maintenance needs,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cI\u2019m extremely picky out there on the mound. Everything has got to be just perfect for me out there, and right now in my career to make that big of an adjustment to a bigger cap is just a little difficult.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy consulted with the company through its design process, but wasn\u2019t on board with the prototype that earned MLB approval.\n\n\u201cThere were heat issues. There were size issues. It was just too much to overcome at that time,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cI\u2019ll always be interested in the other versions that come along, but that one right there wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d\n\nFoster acknowledges that the current model \u201cis not perfect. We\u2019re back at the lab right now. We need to get it a little thinner. . . . There\u2019s vanity and there\u2019s protection, and we just have to close that gap.\u201d He thinks that widespread adoption is not far off.\n\n\u201cClearly, there is a need for it,\u201d Foster says. This is to save someone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nBoth Cobb and McCarthy believe that head protection for youth-league pitchers \u2014 whether it\u2019s Little League, Cal Ripken, Babe Ruth League \u2014 should be mandatory. Considering that Little League pitchers are just 46 feet from home plate, and the hitters are swinging metal bats, it is hard to argue.\n\n\u201cWe make the hitters wear helmets, so I don\u2019t see any reason why (pitchers shouldn\u2019t, too),\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to meet a lot of kids in the past few months who suffered the same injury, a lot of them. If it avoids just one of them having something like that happen and the hell that wreaks on a family, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n\nSays Cobb of the skull cap, \u201cIt\u2019s not cumbersome to the child using it. It\u2019s an easy transition phase for young players. I think it\u2019s an awesome idea that will make the game safer on the youth level.\u201d\n\nAs for when the day will come that protective pitching caps are commonplace \u2014 or even mandatory \u2014 in the big leagues, most agree that the trend, across all sports, is heading that way. The days of Babe Ruth hitting his majestic blasts without a helmet, or Bobby Orr rushing up ice with his hair blowing behind him, are gone. First and third base coaches wear helmets now. Ron Darling still can\u2019t fathom that catchers just used to wear a hat beneath the mask, recalling when the Red Sox Bob Montgomery had the revolutionary idea of using a thin piece of plastic instead.\n\nSays R.A. Dickey, \u201cIf you follow the evolution of the headpiece in baseball it points to growth in greater head protection. I\u2019m not saying it will be mandatory in the next five years, but as better ones come out, with a more refined design, then more guys will choose to wear it.\u201d\n\nBrandon McCarthy, the unwitting poster boy for the issue, doesn\u2019t disagree. He will make his next Yankee start without any protection on his head, no matter the near-fatal hit he took on Sept. 5, 2012, and the scare he got from Shane Victorino 11 months later. Next year, or the year after?\n\n\u201cI think (protective hats for pitchers) will be commonplace at some point,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of the technology and the functionality merging together. The reason I don\u2019t wear it is I don\u2019t think it\u2019s there yet, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ready. Alex Torres thinks it is, so there are going to be people that make that individual decision. There are going to be other companies that come through and really try to hammer it down, to make a piece that everybody gets on board with because it just makes sense to wear something. But it has to fit what you\u2019re trying to do as a professional. I do think it will be something that happens.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With Mark Feinsand and Kristie Ackert\n\nHITS JUST KEEP ON COMING Since Brandon McCarthy took a line drive off his head off the bat of Angels\u2019 Erick Aybar on Sept. 5, 2012, three other pitchers have had similar incidents. Here\u2019s a look: J.A. Happ When: May 7, 2013 Team: Toronto Blue Jays Hit By: Desmond Jennings of the Rays What happened: Taken off the field on a stretcher. Received a head contusion and a laceration to his left ear. Alex Cobb When: June 15, 2013 Team: Tampa Bay Rays Hit By: Eric Hosmer of the Royals What happened: Taken off the field on a stretcher, spent the night at Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg with a concussion. Was out for about two months. Aroldis Chapman When: March 19, 2014 Team: Cincinnati Reds Hit By: Salvador Perez of the Kansas City Royals What happened: He was taken off the field during game with a slight concussion and had surgery to repair broken nose and bones above lef t eye. Was out for two months. \u2014 Bridget Scaturro",

    "text": "Forget the pork. Forget the waste. Forget the 8,570 earmarks in a bill supported by a president who poses as the scourge of earmarks. Forget the \"2 trillion dollars in savings\" that \"we have already identified,\" $1.6 trillion of which President Obama's budget director later admits is the \"savings\" of not continuing the surge in Iraq until 2019 -- 11 years after George Bush ended it, and eight years after even Bush would have had us out of Iraq completely.\n\nForget all of this. This is run-of-the-mill budget trickery. True, Obama's tricks come festooned with strings of zeros tacked onto the end. But that's a matter of scale, not principle.\n\nAll presidents do that. But few undertake the kind of brazen deception at the heart of Obama's radically transformative economic plan, a rhetorical sleight of hand so smoothly offered that few noticed.\n\nThe logic of Obama's address to Congress went like this:\n\n\"Our economy did not fall into decline overnight,\" he averred. Indeed, it all began before the housing crisis. What did we do wrong? We are paying for past sins in three principal areas: energy, health care and education -- importing too much oil and not finding new sources of energy (as in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer Continental Shelf?), not reforming health care, and tolerating too many bad schools.\n\nThe \"day of reckoning\" has arrived. And because \"it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we'll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament,\" Obama has come to redeem us with his far-seeing program of universal, heavily nationalized health care; a cap-and-trade tax on energy; and a major federalization of education with universal access to college as the goal.\n\nAmazing. As an explanation of our current economic difficulties, this is total fantasy. As a cure for rapidly growing joblessness, a massive destruction of wealth, a deepening worldwide recession, this is perhaps the greatest non sequitur ever foisted upon the American people.\n\nAt the very center of our economic near-depression is a credit bubble, a housing collapse and a systemic failure of the banking industry. One can come up with a host of causes: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pushed by Washington (and greed) into improvident loans, corrupted bond-ratings agencies, insufficient regulation of new and exotic debt instruments, the easy money policy of Alan Greenspan's Fed, irresponsible bankers pushing (and then unloading in packaged loan instruments) highly dubious mortgages, greedy house-flippers, deceitful home buyers.\n\nThe list is long. But the list of causes of the collapse of the financial system does not include the absence of universal health care, let alone of computerized medical records. Nor the absence of an industry-killing cap-and-trade carbon levy. Nor the lack of college graduates. Indeed, one could perversely make the case that, if anything, the proliferation of overeducated, Gucci-wearing, smart-ass MBAs inventing ever more sophisticated and opaque mathematical models and debt instruments helped get us into this credit catastrophe.\n\nAnd yet with our financial house on fire, Obama makes clear both in his speech and his budget that the essence of his presidency will be the transformation of health care, education and energy. Four months after winning the election, six weeks after his swearing-in, Obama has yet to unveil a plan to deal with the banking crisis.\n\nWhat's going on? \"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,\" said chief of staff Rahm Emanuel. \"This crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.\"\n\nThings. Now we know what they are. The markets' recent precipitous decline is a reaction not just to the absence of any plausible bank rescue plan, but also to the suspicion that Obama sees the continuing financial crisis as usefully creating the psychological conditions -- the sense of crisis bordering on fear-itself panic -- for enacting his \"Big Bang\" agenda to federalize and/or socialize health care, education and energy, the commanding heights of post-industrial society.\n\nClever politics, but intellectually dishonest to the core. Health, education and energy -- worthy and weighty as they may be -- are not the cause of our financial collapse. And they are not the cure. The fraudulent claim that they are both cause and cure is the rhetorical device by which an ambitious president intends to enact the most radical agenda of social transformation seen in our lifetime.",

    "text": "To go clich\u00e9, there might be only one team that can beat Florida this year and that's Florida. That needs to be put on a bumper sticker and slapped on head coach Urban Meyer's car after he was involved in yet another kitten fight.\n\nFirst, Stewie Griffin, a.k.a. Lane Kiffin, did the equivalent of \"I'm not touching you,\" while holding his finger one inch away from Meyer's face, by claiming the Gators violated recruiting rules. Meyer and Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley were in the right by saying Kiffin was out of line. But instead of blowing off the new guy who was obviously trying to stir the pot, they let Kiffin get under their skin. Meyer has even taken jabs at Kiffin for the now-infamous stunt of ripping off the shirts of recruits in a gimmicky tough-guy ploy. Kiffin has taken up residence in Meyer's kitchen and he's making biscuits.\n\nNow, Meyer is taking on former Florida quarterback and radio show host Shane Matthews, who criticized the offense and the team after last year's loss to Ole Miss. Speaking before the Gator Club, Meyer basically said that outside opinions will not be tolerated or accepted unless there's an \"I Grok Gators\" attached to it.\n\n\"You're either a Gator or you're not a Gator,\" was the exact line Meyer used, and while he didn't call out Matthews by name, it was well known who the intended target was.\n\nMeyer is violating a time-honored rule that you never debate down. If you're in a superior, high-profile position, you're going to be open to swipes, jabs and put-downs as people try to knock you off your pedestal. By acknowledging the slap and trying to fight back, you're showing weakness instead of being confident in your place in the world. Getting involved in a war of words against an inferior opponent just pours gas on the fire.\n\nAct as if you've won two national titles in three years.\n\nAct as if Shane Matthews is Shane Matthews and you're Urban freakin' Meyer, one of only four current college football head coaches, along with Joe Paterno, Bobby Bowden and Dennis Erickson, who have won multiple national championships (yes, I'm aware of Pete Carroll's work, but it's BCS or bust at this point).\n\nAct as if nothing can get to you and the criticisms roll off your back.\n\nAct as if you're not stressing over trying to sustain your current level of unrealistic success.\n\nMost of all, act as if you have the best college football team in America.\n\nThe defending national champions are beyond loaded, with everyone coming back on defense, a veteran offense that will be more than fine once a few receivers emerge and No. 15 under center. Tim Tebow, after all, is making a bid to be considered the greatest quarterback in college football history \u0097 a feasible goal if he can pull off another national title and/or a second Heisman.\n\nThe schedule works out extremely well (at least on paper) with only three dangerous games: at LSU, Georgia and at South Carolina. If the Gators are fully focused and play up to their capabilities, they won't be touched in the other nine games, they'll likely overcome the emotion and the spotlight to beat the Gamecocks and they'll be the better team than Georgia. They can even lose in Death Valley to the Tigers and still wind up playing for the national title by beating everyone else and winning a rematch in the SEC Championship.\n\nThis will be the No. 1 team in the country in every preseason poll that matters and most of the ones that don't, anyone picking someone else for the top spot will be doing it just to be contrary. There's simply no reasonable argument to put anyone but Florida on top of the rankings based on returning talent, but that doesn't mean it can't all be undone if the pressure proves to be too much for Meyer.\n\nSo how could it all come undone? How could this near-perfect team blow it? They could start to let all the outside distractions become a problem.\n\nCoaches preach over and over and over again to be confident but not cocky. Stay focused, don't get caught up in the silly stuff, do your job, blah, blah, blah. While 94 percent of that goes in one ear and out the other, there is something to the rhetoric if teams don't actually adhere to those basic principles. Essentially, barring a rash of major injuries, if Florida can handle the periphery parts of being the defending national champion with having a bull's-eye on its back and if it doesn't get caught up in its own hype, it should win another national title. But Meyer has to be a steadier leader.\n\nIf Meyer loses it every time there's a little bit of criticism, the team will be tighter. He can't be distracted by every shiny ball of tin foil that rolls past him. And even more important, he needs to embrace the critiques and keep improving rather than bunker down and get defensive. If he can't handle the jawing, how is his team supposed to react the first time someone steps up and gets all chest-thumpy? Remember the celebration by Georgia after its first touchdown in the 2007 win over the Gators and how Meyer's team effectively wilted? Again, it all starts at the top.\n\nMatthews actually had a valid point after the Ole Miss game, claiming the coaches didn't take advantage of certain mismatches on offense. He wasn't criticizing to be mean or vindictive; he was saying it out of love for his team and his beloved program. Criticizing the team's lack of effort and focus would have been off base, but he didn't have to go there. Tim Tebow took care of that for him and was immortalized for it with a plaque that hangs on Florida Field.\n\nMatthews has taken the high road through all of this and hasn't used the controversy \u0097 if it really is one \u0097 to further his own radio show host profile, but it hasn't hurt. Now Meyer has to act like an adult and embrace his newfound role as a head coaching God.\n\nLeave the petty stuff to the rest of us, Urban, and come up with the best answer possible by winning another national title. And be prepared to sit back and groove on the criticism if you don't.",

    "text": "Josh Morgan had a disappointing 2013 campaign. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the offseason of 2012, the Washington Redskins made a push to upgrade their wide receiving unit, signing free agent pass-catchers Pierre Garcon and Josh Morgan.\n\nThey envisioned them as a potent pair that would lead the unit and serve as go-to guys for then-rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III.\n\nTwo years later, Garcon has proven that the Redskins made the right call when they signed him to a five-year deal with $20.5 million guaranteed. This past season he led the NFL with 113 catches, which also broke Art Monk\u2019s 29-year-old single-season franchise record.\n\nMorgan, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t had nearly the same type of impact. Last week, his contract was voided and he will be a free agent. He has lobbied for a new deal \u2013 his contract paid him $7.3 million in guaranteed money over the past two seasons \u2013 with his hometown team. But it remains to be seen if the Redskins share his interest.\n\nMorgan got off to a promising start. In 2012, he made some spectacular grabs and gutted his way through painful physical limitations and injuries, including having a plate and seven screws in his right ankle, which made it difficult for him to make cuts and run certain routes. He also had broken bones in both hands. He played in every game and recorded 48 catches for 510 yards and three touchdowns, and also rushed for a touchdown.\n\nAfter having the plate in his ankle removed last offseason, Morgan and the Redskins expected him to become more explosive and productive.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t happen. Morgan opened the season as the starter opposite Garcon, but after a four-catch, 51-yard outing in the season opener, he lost his job to Leonard Hankerson. Morgan initially rotated frequently with the younger, bigger Hankerson. But gradually, he saw his playing time dwindle more and more. He claimed he didn\u2019t know why he was in the doghouse and insisted that he hadn\u2019t done anything to lose his job.\n\n\u25cf Related: Bog: Morgan says Shanahan wouldn\u2019t meet with him | Morgan complains again\n\nBut part of the problem was the fact that Morgan wasn\u2019t doing enough. In Week 2 against Green Bay, he tipped a catchable pass into the hands of a defender in Packers territory. Other times, when he got on the field, he struggled to get open.\n\nThe Redskins relegated him to kick and punt returner, the latter of which was new to him, but he didn\u2019t make an impact in those areas, either. Morgan regained his starting job because Hankerson tore his anterior cruciate ligament, but in the final games he dressed for (he was inactive in the season finale), Morgan managed nine catches for 126 yards. He ended the year with only 20 receptions for 214 yards and no touchdowns.\n\nIn Week 15 against Atlanta, Morgan had a chance to catch a game-winning two-point conversion, but he ran the wrong way on his route and then drifted back toward Garcon in the back corner of the end zone, drawing an extra defender to the area. Kirk Cousins had no choice but to put the ball up high, Garcon couldn\u2019t pull it down and Washington lost.\n\nDespite the poor year, Morgan wants to return to the Redskins.

Uncertainty hangs over Hankerson, and it remains to be seen if Aldrick Robinson (re-signed last week) can develop into a more complete pass-catcher.\n\nBut the team should have options when it comes to the draft or free agency. Wideouts expected to hit the market include Denver\u2019s Eric Decker, Green Bay\u2019s James Jones, Philadelphia\u2019s Riley Cooper, San Francisco\u2019s Anquan Boldin, New England\u2019s Julian Edelman, the Giants\u2019 Hakeem Nicks, Philadelphia\u2019s Jeremy Maclin and Kansas City\u2019s Dexter McCluster.\n\nIf Morgan does return, it will have to be at a significantly lower salary, and he\u2019ll have to convince Bruce Allen, Gruden and offensive coordinator Sean McVay that he is capable of pulling off a significant rebound. But thus far, unlike a number of Washington\u2019s other impending free agents, there haven\u2019t been talks between the two sides.\n\nHave a Redskins question?

    "text": "Baby, a 21-year-old female elephant, seen in front of the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, is part of the wedding celebration of Indian couple Gaurav Assoumul and Kajal Fabiani on March 21, 2011\n\nValery Hache / AFP / Getty Images\n\nThe pomp and splendor on display last month in London convinced millions around the world to not only watch the wedding ceremony of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, but also dub the extravaganza the \"wedding of the century.\" But in India, where the typical upper-class wedding is expected to be an ostentatious spectacle, many well-heeled prospective brides and grooms might be tempted to point out that the century has only just begun.\n\n\"In India, they are like royal weddings every day, particularly at the high end,\" says Anita Patel, managing director of Tania-Tapel Events, a Mumbai-based international event-management company specializing in weddings. For the wealthiest Indian couples, the cachet of the royal seal may be out of reach, but little else is. \"In India, it's more about glamour and glitz. There's more one-upmanship,\" says Patel. \"People want something bigger and better than the last wedding they went to. They want something different every time.\"(See pictures of Queen Elizabeth's most stunning tiaras.)\n\nAnd a booming Indian economy has left more Indian families flush with the cash required to mimic monarchical nuptials. The Indian wedding industry is awash with examples of trend-setting matrimonial excess: flying elephants from India to Monte Carlo to carry the groom on his grand entrance; inviting Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet to perform at a reception; and hiring a fleet of private jets with hourly departures, so guests can come and go as they please. \"The budgets are astronomical,\" says Anaita Shroff Adajania, fashion director at Vogue India. \"I'm sure there's [been] a wedding in India on the scale of the royal wedding, but not [with] the impact.\"\n\nThe spiraling matrimonial budgets of the country's wealthiest politicians, industrialists and celebrities have had a trickle-down effect. A wedding of any scale is an important event for a family in India, and the cost of financing a wedding decades down the road is well known. \"Other than daily life, where individuals are pretty self-contained, a wedding is an opportunity to bring in everyone you've been associated with to show the culmination of 25 years of work,\" says Gourav Rakshit, business head of Shaadi.com, a matchmaking website. But the competitive pressure to keep up with, if not outdo, other families has a downside. \"Most people are mortgaged to the hilt or take out very large loans,\" he says. Some lenders have even begun offering \"auspicious\" wedding loans to families looking to finance an impressive spectacle on the big day.\n\nWith guest lists that often stretch into the thousands for high-profile weddings, and with RSVPs still a rarity, hosts are forced to overcompensate, says Patel. \"I organized a local wedding where we booked food for 500 people, and only 400 came.\" (See a photo album of royal weddings.)\n\nThe escalating extravagance and cost of India's weddings has left some unimpressed. \"They should be smaller,\" says Rayapati Sambasiva Rao, a member of Parliament for the ruling Congress Party. \"There are so many people lavishly spending $3 or $4 million. They can use the money for charity and reduce the expense.\"\n\nExcessive wedding spending is increasingly common not only among the richest Indians but also among the poorest \u0097 prompting official alarm. In April, Kuruppasserry Varkey Thomas, India's Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, floated the idea of curbing the waste with a government cap on the number of wedding guests, as well as the dishes that could be served. In a country where hundreds of millions of people live below the poverty line, food prices have become an explosive political issue. In politics, perceived indifference to the plight of those struggling to feed their families can be devastating. In late 2009, members of Parliament were rebuked by the Prime Minister for their appetite for first-class travel and five-star hotels, even if paid for out of their own pockets.\n\nStill, increased spending on weddings is to be expected, says Ashish Abrol, founder and CEO of BigIndianWedding.com, a one-stop shop for all things matrimonial. \"We're an older society, but our display of wealth shows we're very new to this kind of money,\" he says. \"People haven't seen wealth like this before, so in the initial stages, you have ostentatious displays of wealth. There's this absolute need for display.\"\n\nTo make a splash that gets attention, families have turned over the reins to an army of wedding planners charged with making the big day memorable for guests, in addition to the bride and groom. \"Traditionally, when you went to a wedding, you knew what to expect, but now everyone's trying to give you something you wouldn't expect,\" says Rakshit. \"Given there are so many weddings, it's hard to be unique.\" (See a TIME video on royal weddings and American marriage.)\n\nGone are the days when it was enough to simply feed a thousand friends and relatives. When Indian politician Kanwar Singh Tanwar married off his son last month, 15,000 people attended the ceremony. Having a guest list that resembles the crowd at a sporting event is not all that unusual.\n\nBridal couples arriving by helicopter? Old news on the Indian wedding circuit. So is hiring a Bollywood actor to perform or just rub shoulders with guests. The practice of hiring celebrities is so common that there's even an industry price list for A listers. Shah Rukh Khan, India's biggest star, is quoted at $750,000, while movie heartthrob Salman Khan lists at about half that price.\n\nThen, of course, India has royalty of its own. The Indian royal families of the British colonial period no longer wield power, but with family fortunes still intact, the royal weddings are well known for their opulence. In December, when a prince was married in the western Indian state of Gujarat, the couple rode through the streets on a white stallion while thousands of townspeople lined the streets and leaned over balconies showering them with applause \u0097 and money. (See TIME's complete coverage of Prince William and Kate Middleton's royal wedding.)\n\nWhile Indian weddings have grown in extravagance, it will be difficult to match the glamour of Britain's royal couple. But one potential wedding in India may give the British monarchy a run for its money: that of the dashing presumptive heir of Indian politics, Rahul Gandhi. \"If he were to get married,\" says Rakshit, \"it would be showcased all across the country.\"\n\nSee TIME's 140 best Twitter feeds.\n\nSee the world's most influential people in the 2011 TIME 100.",

    "text": "If anyone has a good handle on how long it will take to solve the U.S. unemployment problem, it's Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.\n\nIn an interview about jobs and the economy, Geithner told me businesses still aren't sure how much demand there will be for their products \u2014 and that is what needs to change before they will start hiring again.\n\nWith six weeks until the midterm elections, Geithner described the Obama administration's effort to put jobs and the economy at the top of its agenda. And while the housing industry is still in a slump, Geithner said the good news is house prices have been stable for more than a year and homes are much more affordable.\n\nThe following are excerpts from my interview with the Treasury secretary, edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ: What do you think it's going to take to get businesses to add new heads to the payroll?\n\nA: It's going to take time, because what businesses need most is to become more confident about how much demand they're going to see for their products.\n\nWhat you're seeing early in the recovery is that they added back hours before they started to add jobs. But they did start adding jobs more quickly than they did the last two recoveries. They're starting that process of bringing people back on, but they've been doing it very gradually because they want to be very confident that the demand for their products is going to be there. And part of that is going to depend on their judgment that we're most of the way through this adjustment process we're going through and that people are saving more, spending less and borrowing less because they want to reduce the amount of debt they hold relative to income.\n\nQ: There is this big debate right now on whether extending the tax cuts for everybody would be more helpful than keeping out the highest earners in that mix. Do you worry that not extending them for the highest earners will be an issue with what you've just said about ensuring that people spend more, put more money back into the economy?\n\nA: What everybody agrees on is, we should extend what we call the middle-class tax cuts. But they also go to about 97% of small businesses. And if we were to move and Congress were to act now on those fronts, that would provide a lot of certainty. We've also proposed making sure that we keep the top rate on dividends, the capital gains, from rising beyond 20%.\n\nQ: Two years after Lehman declared bankruptcy, where are we now in the state of the banking sector? We have new rules requiring more capital. How would you characterize the state of capital for the banking sector today?\n\nA: The U.S. banking system today is in a dramatically stronger position with much higher levels of capital than they had coming into the crisis and a lot more capital relative to most of their major global competitors. And that's a hugely important accomplishment. The government got a very substantial positive return on the investments we made at the banks. We forced private capital to come into the system much earlier than anybody has ever done in a crisis. And we passed a sweeping set of reforms, not just of our financial system, but we're trying to do that on a global basis with a level playing field.\n\nQ: A lot of people say housing is missing in action in this recovery. About a half a million mortgages have been modified under the government's Making Home Affordable program since it started almost 18 months ago. Foreclosures are still high, about 11 million borrowers are under water, and some economists say prices are likely to fall more when the banks unload the foreclosed properties they've been holding off the market. Do you think the administration's programs to aid the housing markets have been a success?\n\nA: You have to judge these things against the alternatives. And what the president's program did, alongside what the Federal Reserve did, is bring a measure of stability to house prices much more quickly than people thought. If you look at where the market thought house prices would go at the beginning of 2009, people thought they might fall another 30%. And what happened is they stabilized because we were able to bring mortgage interest rates down to very low levels, and that helped slow the pace of erosion.\n\nHouse prices have been reasonably stable for more than a year. Mortgage interest rates are very low. Housing is much more affordable than it's been in a really long time.\n\nBut there's still a huge backlog of foreclosures working their way through the system. Now, we can't reach everybody, and a lot of those foreclosures are people with a jumbo (mortgage), it's a relatively expensive home, it's a second home, it's an investor-owned property or it's a family that can't prove income. We just don't think it's fair to ask the American people to use their money, their hard-earned resources, to try to extend the benefits of these programs to people who ended up just living way beyond their means.\n\nI do not agree with people who think that we should be stepping back from the housing market. That would be a mistake. It would be really unfair to all the innocent victims of this crisis.\n\nQ: The president just proposed additional stimulus, the $50 billion toward infrastructure. Can you talk about this plan? And also what is the likelihood that we are going to see jobs created as a result of infrastructure projects? Where and when would those jobs be created?\n\nA: He's proposing to kick-start a multiyear program to upgrade the basic quality of transportation infrastructure in the country. That's very good for the business community because it will make it easier for them to get their products to market. But it's also very good for job creation, because it helps provide some support in areas where people were most hurt by the crisis.\n\nA lot of the pain of the crisis has been borne by people that were in the construction industry. And so it's a very powerful way to get people back to work. It doesn't happen overnight. As you saw in the Recovery Act, a lot of the money that was put aside for public infrastructure took a long time to get through the pipeline, for projects to get approved, for people to be hired. A lot of that is still working its way through the pipeline. But our unemployment problem is going to take a while to solve.\n\nQ: What about the people who say, \"I thought that money was already going to infrastructure in the initial Recovery Act stimulus plan\"?\n\nA: The Recovery Act was a mix of tax cuts, almost $300 billion in tax cuts, as well as support for the safety net for people who lost their jobs through extended unemployment benefits and health insurance, as well as money for state and local governments. So infrastructure was just one piece, and a lot of that money is still working its way through the pipeline as states put these resources to work.\n\nQ: How important are China and India and the emerging markets to the growth of the U.S.? Everybody's always talking about growth outside the U.S. and all these vibrant economies. Why does the average American need to understand that story?\n\nA: Those countries are the most populous and the most rapidly growing countries on the planet. They have huge growing needs for a range of things that Americans are uniquely good at producing. We have a huge stake in those markets, and the parts of the economy now that look the strongest \u2014 high-tech and a bunch of manufacturing sectors where the recovery started soonest \u2014 are strong in part because our companies are so strong in those markets.\n\nQ: So we need to be selling to those markets because they're so populated?\n\nA: It's not just that there's a lot of people who live in those countries but that they're growing very, very rapidly. And as they become more prosperous as countries, they're going to need a lot of things. And we are good at making a lot of things they need, not just airplanes and not just high-technology, but a whole lot of the things that the American economy is uniquely productive at.\n\nQ: Every time I speak to CEOs, I hear a similar complaint \u2014 they're worried about higher health care expenses and higher taxes in 2011. That's why they're sitting on cash. Companies are sitting on, what, $1.8 trillion? Why are they being so conservative with their money, and how are you going to change that mentality so they can start creating some jobs that we need?\n\nA: The biggest thing holding back business spending, and this is what all businesses say, is the scars of the crisis. The crisis was such a shock, caused such a huge panic, and people who faced that trauma have been very tentative about putting that capital to work and hiring back the people that they let go. But it's important to recognize, Maria, despite all the concern out there, businesses always want to have lower taxes and they're always going to want less regulation.\n\nQ: Nouriel Roubini, the New York University economist, said there's a 40% chance of a double-dip recession. What do you say to that?\n\nA: I talk to businesses across the country, and I watch very carefully what private forecasters are saying about the growth outcome. Most people attach a very low probability to a double-dip or a second recession.\n\nOf course, there's always some chance that these recoveries that follow financial crises are much tougher, they're much slower, they're much more protracted, they're much more uneven. That's the tragic reality of recoveries that follow financial crises. But, again, I think that our economy is gradually getting stronger.\n\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

    "text": "I'm trying not to spill pinot grigio on the inlaid Georgian cabinet. Or the Elizabethan refectory table. This is the trouble with being at a party in an antiques shop: nowhere safe to put your glass.\n\nBut people here in the northern English village of Barnard Castle have a remarkably relaxed attitude toward their old and beautiful things, maybe because old and beautiful things are everywhere. The main street is lined with silvery stone houses, some dating from before the Tudors, warm in the honeyed light of Indian summer. The church of St. Mary, its graveyard overrun with hollies and wildflowers, was founded in 1130. There's a museum with everything from El Greco saints to the Queen Mum's hats, and rising above the wild River Tees, the medieval castle that is the town's namesake.\n\nOn an afternoon scented with plate-sized pink and white roses flopping over garden walls, Barnard Castle seems to belong to an England far from the noisy modernity of London -- even though the capital is only 2 1/2 hours away by train. Bob Jordan, owner of the antiques shop, and his wife, Gail, are welcoming friends, customers, whoever walks by on the street, to celebrate the expansion of his quietly elegant emporium.\n\nBarnard Castle is an easy place to be. You can make new friends over a pint of bitter in the pub or find blessed solitude on a country walk along the river. You can explore Roman sites, medieval mansions and pretty churches, or you can eat your way through local game and fish at one of the town's excellent (but not formal) restaurants. There's shopping, too, for antiques, designer clothes and local crafts, and people-watching on the Bank, the town's main drag.\n\nSir Walter Scott, John Wesley, Richard III, Romans and Celtic warrior princesses hung around Barnard Castle. J.M.W. Turner painted here. Charles Dickens researched \"Nicholas Nickleby\" here. Yet despite this A-list history, Barnard Castle, about 45 miles north of York, is almost a secret, unfamiliar even to other Britons.\n\nVisitors heading up the eastern side of England hit York and Durham for their great medieval cathedrals, then hang a left to the Lake District, 40 miles west, to commune with the poetical souls of Wordsworth and Coleridge. Every traveler worth his or her Lonely Planet guide knows Windermere, Grasmere and Hill Top, home of Beatrix Potter. The Lakes even have a tourist mascot, a rapping squirrel named M.C. Nuts throwing down a hip-hop version of Wordsworth's \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud.\"\n\nBut the Northeast, especially the 25 miles of the Tees valley known as Teesdale, boasts no rhyming rodents, no ersatz attractions. Rebecca Jenkins, a writer who lives in Barnard Castle, says, \"People nowadays think the Northeast is derelict coal mines and all sorts of nastiness, but it's glorious. Because there have always been large landowners up here, we've retained our rural character.\"\n\nJenkins has set her new mystery novel series in the area, so she knows it well. \"We've everything in a small space,\" she says. \"Moors, woodland, hills, waterfalls, Bronze Age sites, Roman sites, old abbeys, stately homes, the lot.\"\n\nThe North of England is like the South in the United States. The rest of Britain enjoys making fun of the way Northerners talk and the allegedly strange food (black pudding and tripe) they eat. Northerners own guns and persist in fox hunting, despite its being outlawed; they revel in parochialism (the village five miles up the dale is considered foreign); and they are obsessed with the past.\n\nAs always with stereotypes, some elements are accurate -- at least accurate enough to make me, an American Southerner, feel at home. But the signal truth about the North of England in general, and Barnard Castle in particular, is that people are spectacularly friendly. If a Barneyite says you should stop by the house for a drink, he or she means it. I've been coming up to Barnard Castle since my friend Deborah Jenkins (Rebecca Jenkins's sister) bought a 300-year-old house here and fixed it up so exquisitely it would make Martha Stewart weep with envy. Americans are rare enough here to still be interesting. In my 20 years of visiting, I've never seen the place overrun with busloads of camera-toting tourists. Yet there are plenty of charming, often historic, places to stay, from bed-and-breakfast inns to elegantly decorated cottages.\n\nSome of the links between England's North and America's South are on display in the churchyard of St. Mary's. I pick my way between plots and see Sparky, the luxurious, ink-black community cat, sitting on a grave marked \"Eubank,\" washing her paws. Eubank is a familiar name, one of the many I see on these mossy headstones carved with grinning, scythe-wielding skeletons. Mortham, Hornsby, Snodgrass are names I also know from little towns throughout the South. Some of their kin sailed for America in the early 18th century. Bob Jordan says he noticed \"loads of Teesdale names in Tennessee when I was traveling the States . . . especially Snodgrass.\"\n\nInside the church, you can see 900 years of English history just by turning your head: round-topped Norman arches from the 12th century, fussy Victorian windows, effigies of priests who lived at the time of Chaucer and regimental banners of the Durham Light Infantry dating from before the American Revolution, the silk now so worn you can see clean through the Union Jacks.",

My 86-year-old father has never had to make any decisions and can\u2019t step up to keep the family together.\n\nOne of my five sisters, \u201cRosie,\u201d has alienated all of us (by being verbally abusive) but lives closest to my father and has ingratiated herself into his life. She makes all his decisions, plans overseas trips with him, and is trying to organize his financial affairs because she is worried about her inheritance. She also is very secretive and won\u2019t tell us any of her plans for him. Her behavior is bizarre, but he refuses to say anything to her because she \u201ctakes care of him.\u201d\n\nCarolyn Hax started her advice column in 1997, after five years as a copy editor and news editor in Style and none as a therapist. The column includes cartoons by \"relationship cartoonist\" Nick Galifianakis -- Carolyn's ex-husband -- and appears in over 200 newspapers.\n\nRosie physically attacked one sister, \u201cSally,\u201d and they are not talking to each other. Sally\u2019s daughter is getting married and they did not invite Rosie and her family, so my father says he is not going. We are trying to convince him to not spoil his granddaughter\u2019s special day and that my mom would want him there to represent both of them. And also that the fight is between the sisters, not involving him. Also, he is being hypocritical because years ago, at my mom\u2019s 60th birthday party, he refused to invite one of her sisters. What can we do to convince him to go to the wedding?\n\nD.: Can you step up to keep the family together \u2014 that\u2019s the bigger question, isn\u2019t it?\n\nYour father is clearly vulnerable. Rosie, if I take your account at face value, is unstable, abusive and exploiting his vulnerability to her own advantage.\n\nThese two facts reduce wedding attendance and your niece\u2019s feelings on her \u201cspecial day\u201d to mere trifles. Yes, family warmth and unity are important and, yes, a wedding is a way both to build and express such unity, but even if you persuaded your father to come, you\u2019d still have the much more pressing problem to face of an (alleged) abuser making inroads with Dad.\n\nSo please take the lead in facing it. Enlist the help of your other siblings to get more involved in your father\u2019s life. Don\u2019t try to wrest control from Rosie \u2014 your dad could too easily be the chief victim of such a power struggle \u2014 but instead just assert yourselves through presence in his home.\n\nThere are a lot of you, apparently, so having each of you show up to care for your dad in a relatively non-burdensome rotation would still make for high visibility in his life of people who prioritize his needs over their own. It might be too late to keep Rosie from insinuating herself into your father\u2019s finances, but you can and should position yourselves to monitor his well-being up close.\n\nIf one of you can manage a genuine detente with Rosie, then even better, and not just in a \u201ckeep your enemies closer\u201d sense. The late years of a parent\u2019s life are so difficult logistically and emotionally that the bonds between siblings are often a casualty \u2014 to the point where it\u2019s not uncommon for the one who assumes the role of caregiver, a la Rosie, to be cast as a grasping villain, especially where wills are involved. Judging her involvement from afar enables such myths; showing up makes room for the truth.\n\nWrite to Carolyn Hax at tellme@washpost.com.

He noted that Obama wanted the review completed under his watch.\n\nDuring his campaign for the White House, Trump called on Russia to dig up missing emails from his opponent, Hillary Clinton, from her time as secretary of state under Obama, a fellow Democrat.\n\nThat move prompted critics to accuse him of encouraging foreign actors to conduct espionage.\n\nThe New York businessman has said he is not convinced Russia was behind the attacks, but people he has nominated for top national security posts in his new administration have taken a harsher stance toward Moscow.\n\nRussian officials have denied all accusations of interference in the US election.\n\nObama has come under pressure from Democratic lawmakers to declassify more intelligence on the alleged hackings.\n\nA government source said the review was sparked in part to respond to those demands as well as to determine how much material related to the subject could be made public.\n\nWhen she was working as a senior Federal Bureau of Investigation official in 2008, she said, the agency alerted the presidential campaigns of then-Senator Obama and Republican Senator John McCain that China had infiltrated their respective systems.",

    "text": "Hillary Clinton pledged to fight for higher wages and lift the American middle class on Monday, in a speech that outlined her economic agenda and saw the Democratic presidential candidate take a more aggressive tone towards her Republican rivals.\n\nSpeaking at the New School in Greenwich Village, a New York university known for its progressive worldview, Clinton placed income inequality and improving the conditions of everyday Americans at the heart of her pitch to grow the economy and increase wages.\n\n\u201cI believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have one without the other.\n\n\u201cWe must raise incomes for hard-working Americans so they can afford a middle-class life. We must drive strong and steady income growth that lifts up families and lifts up our country. That will be my mission from the first day I\u2019m president to the last.\u201d\n\nTo alleviate the financial burden on middle-class Americans, Clinton emphasized policies such as paid family leave, lowering childcare costs, passing equal pay for women and raising the minimum wage.\n\nSignalling a willingness to play offense against Republicans, she called out three Republican candidates who are seen as the leaders in a crowded presidential field: Jeb Bush, on workers, Marco Rubio, on taxes, and Scott Walker on unions.\n\nInvoking Bush\u2019s recent comments that Americans need to \u201cwork longer hours\u201d \u2013 a clumsy statement that drew immediate scrutiny from Democrats and the media \u2013 Clinton sought to portray the former Florida governor as out of touch.\n\n\u201cWell, he must not have met many American workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a lecture, they need a raise.\u201d\n\nClinton also described a tax plan proposed by Rubio, a senator from Florida, as \u201ca sure, budget-busting giveaway to the super wealthy\u201d.\n\nAlex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, responded to Clinton\u2019s jab by saying the former secretary of state \u201cwants to take us back to yesterday\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe cannot raise taxes like the 1990s or increase spending like the 2000s,\u201d Conant said in an email to the Guardian. \u201cMarco is proposing a 21st-century tax plan that would benefit all Americans, especially middle-class families.\u201d\n\nOf Walker, the anti-union Wisconsin governor who formally launched his presidential campaign on Monday, Clinton said she would fight back against the \u201cmean-spirited, misguided attacks\u201d on workers waged by him and other Republican chief executives.\n\n\u201cRepublican governors like Scott Walker have made their names stomping on workers\u2019 rights,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nThe Bush campaign hit back with a statement that characterized her proposals as \u201cantiquated\u201d.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is proposing the same failed policies we have seen in the Obama economy, where the typical American household\u2019s income has declined and it\u2019s harder for businesses to hire and the middle class to achieve rising incomes,\u201d Allie Brandenburger, a Bush spokeswoman, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAmericans want to work and want the opportunity to achieve earned success for their families, but Secretary Clinton\u2019s antiquated proposals protect the special interests that want to stifle American ingenuity and 21st-century companies like Uber that are creating jobs. Governor Bush believes harnessing innovation and fostering technology can help us grow at 4% once again.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s tough talk was not reserved just for Republicans \u2013 sounding ever the progressive, the former first lady also vowed to go after individuals and corporations on Wall Street that run afoul of the law.\n\n\u201cToo many of our major financial institutions are still too complex and too risky and the problems are not limited to the big banks that get all the headlines,\u201d she said, adding that she would appoint bank regulators who recognized that \u201ctoo big to fail is still too big a problem\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere can be no justification or tolerance,\u201d she said, for criminal behavior, committing to going beyond the 2010 Wall Street reform legislation known as Dodd-Frank.\n\nClinton faces a primary challenge from Bernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who is running for president as a Democrat and is a vocal critic of Wall Street. Although Clinton struck a firm tone on the financial services industry, she remained measured \u2013 citing her role as a former senator from New York to point out that she knows \u201cfirst-hand the role Wall Street can and should play in the economy\u201d.\n\nClinton said she would later introduce in more detail her plans to boost the economy and reform the tax code \u2013 including a proposal to reform capital gains taxes \u2013 to increase the minimum wage, boost infrastructure investment and establish universal preschool.\n\nIn conclusion, Clinton added a personal touch to summarize her approach to steering the economy. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the grandmother in me,\u201d Clinton said, but \u201cleadership is planting trees under whose shade you will never sit.\u201d",

    "text": "St. Louis general manager John Mozeliak played the waiting game \u0097 and won.\n\nThe Cardinals were after Matt Holliday last winter.\n\nThe Rockies asking price was steep.\n\nEight months later, the A's had to salvage what they could, and sent Holliday to St. Louis.\n\nIt's a win-win for Mozeliak.\n\nHe avoided the temptation last winter, when the Rockies were looking at a return on Holliday of big-league outfielder Ryan Ludwick, second baseman/outfielder Skip Schumaker, and right-handed pitcher Mitchell Boggs, who spent time in the Cardinals rotation earlier this season.\n\nWithout Holliday, the Cardinals still found themselves in first place in the NL Central, leading by a game on Friday morning.\n\nThen they got Holliday from Oakland. As well as bringing a legitimate bat to compliment Albert Pujols, Holliday also provides an emotional lift to his new teammates because the organization stepped up and added the right-handed slugger. The cost? Three prospects, none of which showed promise of having an impact in St. Louis.\n\nIt's a gamble that backfired on Oakland general manager Billy Beane, who gave up closer Huston Street, promising outfielder Carlos Gonzalez, and left-handed pitcher Greg Smith to acquire Holliday. His hope was that a strong first half by Holliday would perk the interest of contenders, but instead, economic concerns along with a sluggish begging for Holliday, left Beane without a strong bidding war.\n\nHis option was to bite the bullet, allow Holliday to file for free agency, then offer him arbitration with the expectation he would get two first-round draft picks as compensation for losing Holliday. The uncertainty about the free agent market this offseason, however, created the possibility that agent Scott Boras could call Beane's bluff and accept arbitration from Oakland, like he did once for Kevin Millwood in Atlanta.\n\nThat meant Beane had to cut his losses and take what he could get for Holliday, even if it also required the tight-budged A's to include $1.5 million to help offset what remains on Holliday's $13.5 million salary in 2009.\n\nBrett Wallace was the strongest prospect of the three players the Cardinals parted with, but he is a DH-in-waiting, nothing more. He showed big-time power at Arizona State, which prompted St. Louis to make him a first-round draft choice last June, but was rushed in the Cardinals depleted farm system, and had only 35 RBI this year in 94 games combined between Double-A Springfield and Triple-A Louisville.\n\nRight-handed pitcher Clayton Mortensen was the Cardinals' No. 1 pick in 2007, and like Wallace has been rushed in the minors, where he is a combined 16-19 with a 4.31 earned-run average.\n\nThe A's, meanwhile, picked up minor-league outfielder Shane Peterson as the third player from St. Louis, a second-round draft pick from a year ago, who is considered a \"tweener'' among scouts, which means he projects as a possible backup outfielder, not having the speed to be a center fielder on a contender nor the power to play a corner position on a daily basis.\n\nFor general manager Dan O'Dowd, watching the Holliday deal come down on Friday had to reaffirm his confidence in the decision he made last winter. There were questions at the time as to whether he might have been able to get a stronger package in return for Holliday if he had held on to the outfielder until July.\n\nThe answer appears to be an emphatic no, particularly not for a team like the Rockies that had visions of contending, even if it did feel it was necessary to move a middle-of-the-lineup player like Holliday.\n\nIt was silly listening to a national commentator the other night mentioning that the Rockies had moved ahead of the Giants in the wild-card race, and then musing about how good they might have been if Holliday had still been in Colorado.\n\nA key reason that the Rockies are where they are is they dealt Holliday. That's not a knock on Holliday, but rather a statement of what Huston Street has meant to the Rockies. The question Rockies fans are left to ponder is where they would have been without Street.\n\nStreet has regained his late-inning magic, and went into the weekend not only tied for the NL lead with 24 saves, but had failed in only one save situation this season and had converted his last 16 opportunities, the longest current streak in the big leagues.\n\nGonzalez, meanwhile, is only 10 months older the Wallace, and while he doesn't have Wallace's power, Wallace is not in the same area code as Gonzalez in any other aspect of the game. And while Smith is rebuilding arm strength following surgery last October, he already has proven he can be a capable back of the rotation starter, which is what the A's are only hoping Mortensen can handle.\n\nHere's an ironic twist to the whole deal. In the 2008 draft, the A's, in both the first and second rounds, passed on Wallace and Peterson. Oakland selected Jemile Weeks in the first round, directly ahead of St. Louis picking Wallace, and Oakland selected right-hander Tyson Ross in the second round, directly ahead of St. Louis picking Peterson.",

    "text": "BANGALORE, March 23 | Fri Mar 23, 2012 12:06am EDT\n\nBANGALORE, March 23 (Reuters) - As the U.S. presidential election ramps up the rhetoric against offshoring jobs, India's flagship software services providers are seeking an image makeover.\n\nFor Wipro, Infosys and others, multi-billion dollar outsourcing giants with U.S.-listed shares, the challenge is to be seen less as a cheap Bangalore dump for U.S. companies shipping work overseas, and more as responsible firms creating jobs and investing in America's future.\n\n\"If young people in America look at us as a career opportunity, we have succeeded,\" T V Mohandas Pai said six years ago when he was a board member at Infosys.\n\nToday, India's $100 billion IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) industry says it directly employs 107,000 people in the United States, close to a third of whom are Americans, a figure that has doubled in five years.\n\nThe industry's makeover takes on a new urgency ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November where jobs will be a crunch issue. President Barack Obama has sharpened his criticism of U.S. firms 'exporting' jobs, seeking to tax them more and use that money to help those that keep jobs at home.\n\n\"I'm responsible for transforming the organisation into one having a look and feel of a U.S. corporation ... changing Infosys in USA to Infosys USA,\" Padmanabhan Rao, who heads the company's U.S. operations, writes as his LinkedIn profile.\n\nIt's increasingly a business reality.\n\nThe outsourcing industry, championed by India but spreading to other Asian centres such as the Philippines, expects to hit $225 billion in annual revenues by 2020 - an unrealistic target without strong growth in the United States, the biggest market.\n\nInfosys has 15,000 employees in the United States, including those with shorter-term work permits, and will have hired another 1,200 locals in the past year. North American clients generate close to two-thirds of global revenue. Infosys employs more than 145,000 people worldwide.\n\nRao told Reuters the goal for Infosys is to double local recruitment, and that may happen as early as the next fiscal year. Part of his job, Rao says, is \"to get Infosys to think global, but act local.\"\n\nIndian outsource firms are \"willing to step up and do things a little bit different to show their investment in the U.S. economy,\" said Helen Huntley, a vice president at Gartner Inc, noting the tone of political debate has grown harsher in line with greater economic uncertainty.\n\n\"That's political motivation as well as motivation for clients ... (who want to see) feet on the street,\" she said.\n\nBy setting up shop in the United States, Indian outsourcers could win more business from smaller U.S. customers under pressure in an election year to hire and outsource locally.\n\n\"It plays naturally to Indian providers who want to show a presence in the U.S.,\" said Huntley.\n\nThe Indian firms are increasingly looking to transfer staff from their clients on to their own books to secure orders. This also helps as a public relations tool to raise their profile as local job creators, Huntley noted, and can qualify for certain state incentives.\n\nWhen Tata Consultancy Services opened a centre in Cincinnati, Ohio in 2009, the state governor attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony.\n\n\"The Indian companies are very engaged\" in getting local political support, noted Huntley. TCS, India's No.1 software services exporter, last month opened a technology centre in Santa Clara, California to serve as global headquarters for its mobile computing work.\n\nWipro, which began after the Second World War as a sunflower oil producer and moved into India's fledgling IT sector in the early 1980s, also wants to boost its overseas, or ex-India, workforce. Chairman Azim Premji wants as much as half his total staffing to be local, in the United States and elsewhere, and he holds up the firm's Atlanta, Georgia centre as an example of how Wipro has successfully recruited local talent.\n\n\"That's our goal for the next 2-3 years and I think it's completely do-able ... even if I have to thrust it from the top,\" Premji said in January after Wipro reported a 10 percent increase in quarterly profit.\n\nWipro employs some 10,000 people in the United States, Chief Marketing Officer Rajan Kohli said in response to an e-mailed request, adding Atlanta is a \"strategic development centre\", with U.S. citizens making up 80 percent of its 675 staff. Wipro's global workforce tops 120,000.\n\n\"We're driving diversity in our hiring by consciously inducting local talent, military veterans and campus recruits,\" Kohli said, and expects to replicate the Atlanta model in at least two other U.S. cities.\n\nAt Infosys, CEO S.D. Shibulal is looking to add small development centres in the United States. As well as its large campuses in India, Infosys has 15 delivery centres worldwide, from the Czech Republic and Poland to Brazil and China - facilities where software programs are written and applications developed and tested.\n\n\"I can say this: One-third of all growth in talent (in the U.S.) will be local,\" Shibulal told Reuters.\n\nThe larger outsourcing firms are not alone in buffing up their global credentials.\n\nMindTree Ltd, a $500 million IT and electronics engineering services provider with a client list that includes Microsoft and Kraft, has engaged global branding consultant Siegel+Gale for its image makeover, co-founder Subroto Bagchi told Reuters.\n\nBangalore-based MindTree will soon open its first 400-seat delivery centre in the United States, and expects eventually that as much as a third of its workforce will be local to wherever it does business, s ai d Scott Staples, another co-founder of the company.\n\nAnd that's another challenge for Indian companies hoping local U.S. recruitment will give them a more American face.\n\n\"We don't have a lot of (local) Java programmers with two years experience running around,\" said Stephanie Moore, a vice president at Forrester Research Inc, echoing Obama's lament that too few Americans opt for STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) streams at schools and colleges.\n\nWipro's Premji agrees, noting that while most customer-facing sales and support hires are local, the majority of technical staff are on Indian-origin visas.\n\n\"There's a huge shortage of technical IT professionals in the United States,\" he said.\n\nFor now, the vast majority of the 2.8 million people employed in the Indian IT/BPO industry work in India. At the top five Indian providers, only 40,000 - fewer than 1.5 percent - are non-Indian, according to the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom), an Indian software industry lobby group.\n\n\"Wipro isn't yet a household name on U.S. campuses, but we have been able to generate significant and increasing interest,\" said Kohli. \"We've kicked off major initiatives on campuses to showcase our differentiators and attract the best talent.\"\n\nKiran Karnik, a former Nasscom president and author of \"The Coalition of Competitors\" published in February, sees parallels between now and the first backlash against the loss of U.S. jobs to India's outsourcers following the dotcom bust - with the United States slowly emerging from an economic downturn and facing presidential elections where jobs will figure large.\n\nBack then, Nasscom made itself invisible, but engaged a PR/advocacy agency and networked with 'sister body' the Information Technology Association of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.-India Business Council.\n\nThis week, Nasscom has published a report to showcase just how it is contributing to the U.S. economy, by creating jobs, paying more than $15 billion in taxes over five years and investing another $5 billion through U.S. acquisitions.\n\nIndirectly, India's IT/BPO industry supports 280,000 jobs in the United States, the report said.\n\nWipro, Infosys and other Indian firms in the U.S. market help run local community marathons and university fun runs and, at last August's InfosysConnect in Las Vegas, an event for the company's partners, analysts and clients, tennis star Andre Agassi was an invited guest to share the stage with Stephen Pratt, Infosys' top business consultant.\n\n\"Incremental goals add up over time,\" Pratt tweeted from the event.",

    "text": "When toy maker GoldieBlox introduced itself to the world in the fall of 2012, it was built on an idea that was both forward thinking and antiquated. The company\u2019s concept? Get girls more interested in engineering and science by selling problem-solving toy sets. But the protagonist? Another white, blonde girl.\n\nIn a toy world where perhaps the most popular character ever is the yellow-haired Barbie, Goldie Blox \u2013 the Harry Potter of founder Debbie Sterling\u2019s new math-based world \u2013 seemed like a safe bet. And Sterling, in an interview with Fortune, concedes she remembers hearing some early complaints about the selection.\n\n\u201cSome initial criticism we had at the beginning was \u2018not another blonde white girl,'\u201d Sterling recalled.\n\nStill, early press was favorable for GoldieBlox, which sells science-based construction sets that come with boxes and toy characters. It launched a successful Kickstarter campaign. Less than two years later, it won a coveted Super Bowl advertising contest backed by Intuit intu , becoming the first small business to ever air a commercial during the most-popular event of the year.\n\nAs buzz \u2013 and sales \u2013 expanded, GoldieBlox found itself winning over parents and kids, retail support from partners like Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us and Amazon.com amzn , and accolades from toy experts and bloggers.\n\nBut Sterling always had it in the back of her mind that she wanted her franchise to be more than just built on the back of the blonde Goldie Blox character. Her ah-ha moment came when she was presenting the GoldieBlox story the fall of 2014 to Cinnamongirl, a California-based nonprofit that encourages young girls to participate in science, the arts and other relevant fields.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling this story about GoldieBlox and showing the sketches of this blonde, white girl and I felt awkward standing up there,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized how important Ruby was.\u201d\n\nRuby Rails is the second character Sterling unveiled for her toy brand, a popular African American girl who is a whiz at coding. Since then, two other characters have joined the team: Valentina Voltz (a Hispanic engineer) and Li Gravity (a lover of stunts and also an expert at physics).\n\nThat broader diversity is a way GoldieBlox can stay true to the company\u2019s core mission, Sterling says.\n\n\u201cThe whole impetus of GoldieBlox was changing the conversation from a young age of what is normal, acceptable and fun for a girl to do,\u201d says Sterling. \u201cThe toys, characters and stories we create can connect the dots between math and science and make those skills fun and relevant to kids.\u201d\n\nWhile privately-held GoldieBlox won\u2019t disclose annual sales, there are indications that message is resonating with kids. Five years ago, Sterling went to the industry\u2019s influential New York Toy Fair with only a backpack full of prototypes and sketches. She now runs one of the largest booths on the floor for a new startup. The company has sold more than 1 million toys to girls since its inception. It won a Toy of the Year award in 2014.\n\nThere are indications the broader industry is changing. Mattel\u2019s mat Barbie is embracing new shapes and races. Target tgt has ditched gender-specific labeling in the toy aisle to be more inclusive. And for Sterling \u2013 who says she grew up only playing with white dolls \u2013 she strikes a more hopeful tone about what the future can look like for kids.\n\n\u201cI grew up playing with Barbies and ponies and I was lucky enough to discover engineering through the encouragement of a math teacher,\u201d Sterling said. GoldieBlox is a way she can promote and sell the idea of math to today\u2019s girls. And while she admits not everyone will become an engineer or a math pro, \u201cSome of them will. Or they will end up doing something they never thought they could do.\u201d",

Or, at the very least, let software begin to shift the manufacturing industry from one focused solely on a final product to one that equally emphasizes quick design and prototyping services.\n\nTo that end, it launched MySolidWorks in February. (The name, of course, refers to Dassault subsidiary company SolidWorks, the company that produces the eponymous computer-aided design software in use by many in the manufacturing sector.) On MySolidWorks, a virtual network of about 60 companies are listed that specialize in CNC milling, injection molding, 3D printing, and sheet metal manufacturing. All SolidWorks users have access to the network. The network is a do-over of a similar sort of network Dassault DASTY had set up about five years ago, but this time manufacturers and users share the same online platform. It\u2019s Dassault\u2019s bid to connect the roughly 2.5 million users of its CAD software\u2014and those using the 3MF file format\u2014with manufacturers who can accept users\u2019 designs, quote them a price, and then manufacture and ship a product prototype.\n\n\u201cThe goal here is to allow our users to use our software to design products, like in the auto, construction, and other industries,\u201d says Andreas Kulik, director of product portfolio and business development at Dassault. \u201cThey use our products to design projects they\u2019re working on, and then you get to manufacturing what the engineers design and testing it out, making sure it meets specifications.\u201d\n\nIn other words: close the gap between design and manufacturing, especially advanced forms of it like 3D printing. Use software to shorten the time it takes between designing a prototype and manufacturing it, while attempting to save money in the process by having a large number of potential manufacturers from which to choose. Right now the listed manufacturers, which are Dassault customers with subscriptions, are limited to North America. However, Dassault plans to open up the manufacturing network on MySolidWorks internationally in Q4 of this year.\n\n\u201cIt becomes kind of like the Yelp of manufacturing services, user-reviewed and -rated,\u201d says Kulik. \u201cWe\u2019re closing the bridge to: how can I find somebody who can build something for me at the right price?\u201d\n\nThis is manufacturing as a service, says Kulik, which sounds like software as a service for a reason. Contract manufacturing has always been a service, but what\u2019s changing the manufacturing industry now is the digitization of design. In a matter of hours, sometimes minutes, companies or individual customers who need a prototype manufacturing\u2014and can\u2019t do so in-house\u2014can have a quote prepared outlining the exact production costs based on nothing more than a CAD design.\n\n\u201cThis might not seem like a big deal if you buy a lot on Amazon, but I can tell you this doesn\u2019t really exist very much in manufacturing,\u201d says Robert Bodor, vice president and general manager of the Americas for Proto Labs. \u201cThis kind of instant feedback is very valuable.\u201d\n\nIndeed, so valuable that Proto Labs was chosen by Dassault as the launch partner when it debuted MySolidWorks in February. Based in Minnesota, the publicly-traded Proto Labs PRLB uses injection molding and other additive manufacturing processes to create custom prototypes and low-volume production parts. (The company recently made Fortune\u2019s list of the 100 fastest-growing companies.) Using proprietary software algorithms, Proto Labs can receive a CAD file, evaluate the designed part in that file\u2014the geometrics, the pathways cutting tools will have to make, and so on\u2014and return precise manufacturing quotes to potential customers.\n\n\u201cWe virtually manufacture the part in a matter of minutes to hours in a supercomputer cluster. Then we\u2019re able to generate thousands of quotes a day for customers in a short period of time, and [you] get a quote that\u2019s very precise because we\u2019ve calculated what it\u2019s going to cost to make that part,\u201d says Bodor. \u201cSo we\u2019ve cut a lot of manual labor out of quoting and the manufacturing design process.\u201d\n\nEmbedding software into the manufacturing process allowed Proto Labs to generate quotes for more than 10,000 developers in the last quarter of 2014. Being listed on MySolidWorks\u2014having access to potentially thousands more customers\u2014the company now expects to push its annual revenues from roughly $210 million to $1 billion. Kulik thinks MySolidWorks can drive similar growth for other manufacturers listed on the platform, while simultaneously making it more convenient for individuals and companies to have product prototypes designed. Before any part heads to mass production, a quote from a MySolidWorks partner should be able to tell a user how much it costs and how long it takes to machine a certain part.\n\n\u201cThe manufacturing network is a strategic initiative for us,\u201d Kulik says. \u201cWe want to make users more productive; we don\u2019t want users to experience barriers.\u201d",

    "text": "On Feb. 11, Kanye West will release his seventh studio album, the mysteriously titled The Life of Pablo (formerly known as Waves, Swish and So Help Me Good at different times throughout the past year). Judging by West\u2019s initial borderline-illegible, hand-written tracklist\u2014which has now turned into a yearbook-like piece of music history, with all his famous friends adding their signatures\u2014the album could feature some high-profile guests besides the ones we already know about (including Sia, Kendrick Lamar and Ty Dolla $ign). Here\u2019s a look back at some of his most memorable collaborations:\n\nPicking a favorite verse on this bouncy ode to getting high and getting laid probably doubles as some kind of personality test, but the best guest spot might actually belong to Sumeke Rainey, an ex-girlfriend of West\u2019s who provides the endlessly quotable \u201cYou mean Talib? Lyrics stick to your rib?\u201d exchange. Amy Schumer knows all the words to it, and there\u2019s no reason you shouldn\u2019t either.\n\nRihanna is the only artist officially featured on this embodiment of the \u201ceverything but the kitchen sink\u201d philosophy, but its credits read like the kind of genre- and generation-spanning lineup usually only the Grammys are crazy enough to conceive: Elton John, Drake, La Roux\u2019s Elly Jackson, Alicia Keys, Fergie (whose part is sadly cut from the video version) and others all contributed vocals.\n\nThe rapper and the helmeted highnesses of dance music proved they weren\u2019t such unlikely bedfellows when West sampled them on \u201cStronger,\u201d but on 2013\u2019s Yeezus they took their partnership into a distorted new dimension with \u201cOn Sight\u201d and the sinister \u201cSend It Up.\u201d Think the TRON: Legacy soundtrack, hacked by cyberpunk supervillains.\n\nKanye West has called himself a deity, the next Steve Jobs and the greatest living rock star, so it was only a matter of time before he teamed up with one of popular music\u2019s GOATs. The surprise was just how vulnerable the fruits of their labor would be: who knew a Beatle, a hip-hop titan and the princess of prolific club-bangers would make magic on songs that have zero drums? (Too bad Yeezy and Riri have both left them off their new albums.)\n\nTwo rappers performing a song that samples a Will Ferrell comedy a dozen times in a row in concert is indulgent to say the least\u2014some might say it\u2019s, well, cray\u2014but this opulent bragfest doesn\u2019t lose its luster during back-to-back listens. Carry on, gentlemen.\n\nThe third single off of West\u2019s Graduation album had a more lasting impact on his career than any of the others that year. The light-hearted party track found him teaming up with Auto-Tune pioneer T-Pain, who would later inspire West to make his highly influential 808s & Heartbreak\u2014an album that brought West tremendous acclaim while T-Pain more or less became the butt of jokes for his association with the trend.\n\nThe rappers\u2019 verses function like the little angel and devil sitting on your shoulders: West plays the reformed workaholic \u201cdouchebag,\u201d showing you how to own up to mistakes after an unfavorable period of media scrutiny; meanwhile, future G.O.O.D. Music president Pusha is happy for you and is gonna let you finish, but he sticks to his a-hole offensive after West pushed him to write crueler rhymes in the studio. Good call on Ye\u2019s part: the song is all the better for that balance.\n\nWhen West asked Jamie Foxx to dust off his Ray Charles impression, he was no stranger to getting around sampling-related red tape by hiring one vocalist to impersonate another. (See: Syleena Johnson covering Lauryn Hill on \u201cAll Falls Down.\u201d) The more out-of-the-box idea? Recruiting film composer and Fiona Apple collaborator Jon Brion to add orchestral flourishes to this and other tracks from 2005\u2019s Late Registration.\n\nClosing out Yeezus was a jarringly tender tribute to what West would probably consider his greatest collaboration of all: his romance with then-girlfriend, now-wife Kim Kardashian. All that sweetness would have seemed out of place were it not for Charlie Wilson, who slices through West\u2019s slurry cheer with a melancholy chorus so fragmented you can practically hear the punctuation marks.\n\nOf course this song would be here: when in music history has a main attraction been so gloriously upstaged at its own event? (Besides this weekend\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show.) Most songs are over by the 3 \u00bd minute mark, but that\u2019s just where \u201cMonster\u201d just gets started thanks to a Nicki Minaj verse so iconic it makes the song\u2019s weirdest attribute\u2014a Bon Iver appearance\u2014seem almost pedestrian.",

However, landlords do face risks associated with interest rates, tenant bankruptcies and finding new tenants when leases expire.\n\n\"That may be a boring thing to tell your friends, but it's served us well,\" said Roddick, who last year joined the PowerShares Series, a tennis circuit that lets him play with legends like Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras.\n\nRoddick said he's also padding his paycheck by moving over to the \"dark side of media.\" Rather than jumping into the booth at the Tennis Channel, he was hired by Fox Sports 1 to talk about all things sports as a co-host of Fox Sports Live.

They are aiming to get to 245 members, which would be the largest Republican majority since the end of World War II. Currently, Republicans hold 233 seats to the Democrats\u2019 199. There are three vacancies.\n\nHouse Republicans are not alone in their belief that there will be notably fewer Democrats in the 114th Congress. Famed political prognosticator Charlie Cook sees Republicans holding as many as 248 seats, while his esteemed counterpart Stu Rothenberg projects the high mark for Republicans will be as many as 245.\n\nTo achieve success, Republicans will need to win in all three of these categories:\n\n1. Open seats currently held by a Republican in Republican territory.\n\n2. Seats currently held by a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\n3. Seats currently held by a Democrat in swing territory.\n\nAs results on the East Coast should be known early, here are three races to watch to gauge the potential for Republicans to reach 245 seats in the House by the end of the evening.\n\nThe 10th Congressional District of Virginia. With the retirement of Rep. Frank Wolf, Republicans must hold this sprawling Northern Virginia district, which he has represented since 1981. Republican State Delegate Barbara Comstock faces Democrat Fairfax County Supervisor John Foust. As evidenced by Republicans winning this congressional district by a mere 1 percent in last year\u2019s gubernatorial election, it has become increasingly competitive. With her repeated elections to the state House, Comstock has shown an ability to win in the more challenging areas of the congressional district for Republicans. She will easily hold this seat if she continues to do well with voters in her current state legislative district and scores big victories in the traditionally Republican strongholds in the western counties and cities in the district.\n\nThe 3rd Congressional District of West Virginia. This race represents a Republican pickup opportunity. Republican presidential nominees have won the district recently, while Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall continues to hold on. State Sen. Evan Jenkins offers Republicans the most credible nominee the party has had since the mid-\u201990s. In a race that will see as much advertising by third-party organizations as any House race in the country, the winner will be the candidate who voters believe will do the most to take on President Obama\u2019s War on Coal and the EPA.\n\nThe 2nd Congressional District of New Hampshire. Election outcomes in this district have mirrored the national environment lately as much as any congressional district in the country. In a year favoring Republicans, this provides a welcome advantage for State Rep. Marilinda Garcia, who is challenging the Democratic incumbent, Rep. Ann Kuster. Through her work in the New Hampshire House, Garcia has advocated against ObamaCare and championed alternative ideas to improve access to and quality in health care.\n\nConversely, Kuster has said she would vote for ObamaCare again if she had the chance. If the political impact of ObamaCare is enough to decide an election, it will happen in this district.\n\nBy winning these three races, the question throughout the night will increasingly become which Republican candidate\u2019s victory expands the majority to 245 seats.\n\nWho do you think it will be?\n\nDavid Avella is president of GOPAC and a veteran Republican strategist.

The 19-year-old finally redeemed herself \u2013 and won a Golden Ticket \u2013 by singing Corinne Bailey Rae\u2019s \u201cLike a Star.\u201d\n\nShlubby frat boy Kyle Crews wowed the judges, especially Tyler, who proclaimed that he was \u201cthe best male voice\u201d that they have heard so far.\n\nJudge Jennifer Lopez was horrified to realize that the last time she saw contestant Jane Carrey (comedian Jim Carrey\u2019s daughter) was on the set of the \u201880s variety show \u201cIn Living Color\u201d \u2013 when the \u201cIdol\u201d hopeful was just two.\n\nCarrey sang Bonnie Raitt\u2019s \u201cSomething to Talk About\u201d and won a ticket (back) to Hollywood.\n\nJason \u201cWolf\u201d Hamlin closed the show by singing \u201cMidnight Special\u201d by Creedence Clearwater Revival followed by a stunning version of \u201cFolson Prison Blues\u201d on acoustic guitar \u2013 or as Hamlin described it, his \u201cgit fiddle.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, they weren\u2019t all winners on Sunday\u2019s special version of \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d\n\nJennifer Diley, a curvy \u201csushi bar waitress\u201d and self-described \"patriot\" failed to impress the judges with her warbled rendition of Jessica Simpson\u2019s \u201cWith You.\u201d Dressed in a teeny-tiny stretch bandeau top paired with what could best be described as jean bikini bottoms at least three sizes too small, the busty 19-year-old\u2019s audition fell flat.\n\n\u201cI think your voice lacks the fire that your getup has,\u201d lamented Tyler.\n\nNext up: The lush mountains of Aspen, Colorado, where, presumably, it won\u2019t be as noisy.",

    "text": "Rick Perry said in an interview Thursday that his long tenure as governor of Texas will set him apart from his potential rivals in the 2016 Republican presidential contest, pointing to President Obama's legislative career as a warning against picking a senator as the GOP nominee.\n\nWhen asked how he differs from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a conservative firebrand, Perry cited his extended run as governor and his handling of several state crises.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the selling points, if you will, to the American people as they decide who is going to follow Barack Obama,\u201d Perry said in a joint interview with The Washington Post and the Texas Tribune. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to make a rather radical shift away from a young, untested United States senator whose policies have really failed.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThey\u2019re going to look for somebody that\u2019s got the executive experience. And my feel, my advice, and my instinct is that they\u2019re going to look for someone who has a substantial track record, someone who\u2019s been tested and someone who has the results of what they put into place.\u201d\n\nPerry\u2019s argument for a seasoned governor to lead his party in the next presidential election is the core of his latest pitch in recent meetings with GOP leaders in Iowa and other early primary states.\n\nCruz -- elected in 2012 and a favorite of the movement right -- has become a threat to Perry\u2019s political comeback as both men eye a White House bid. Often drawing from the same pool of donors in Texas, they are also competing for the support of national conservative figures.\n\nPerry said he made decisions and dealt with situations as governor that have prepared him to be president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got 14 years of being an executive,\" Perry said. \"And a governor, whether it\u2019s myself or other governors, you get up every day and you may face a challenge that you had no idea was coming, like a space shuttle that falls out of the sky in the eastern part of your state or a hurricane in a neighboring state that pushes hundreds of thousands of people into your state.\"\n\nPerry, who left office last month, has been busy traveling the country as he works to reintroduce himself to Republican voters following his disastrous and short-lived 2012 presidential campaign. He has also brought policy scholars to Austin to brief him and has met with GOP luminaries such as former secretary of state Henry Kissinger.\n\nAddressing the controversy this week over whether childhood vaccinations should be mandatory amid a rise in measles cases, Perry said national and state leaders should use their power to encourage shots. Two other 2016 GOP hopefuls, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), suggested vaccines should not be mandated.\n\n\u201cI think governors, elected officials, people in positions of authority and power and influence, should use those positions to make sure that the people they either represent or have the opportunity to work for are as healthy as they can be,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously vaccines are a very important part of that.\u201d\n\nPerry said that when he came into office, \u201cour vaccination rate in Texas was 65 percent. When I left two weeks ago, it was 95 percent.\u201d\n\n\"We know that vaccines are a very, very important tool to keep our citizens safe,\" Perry said. \"I think it\u2019s important for us to stand up and say, \u2018You need to vaccinate your children. You need to do everything you can to keep them and the other children and the people they come into contact with safe.\u2019\u201d\n\nPerry was criticized by GOP competitors during the 2012 race for a mandate requiring that most girls in his state get inoculated against the human papillomavirus, a sexual infection that can lead to cervical cancer.\n\nMeanwhile, Perry is adjusting to life outside of the governor\u2019s mansion. He arrived at the Washington Post\u2019s newsroom on Thursday carrying his coat and flanked by a couple of young aides -- a far cry from the large security detail and others who trailed him while he was governor.\n\n\u201cI had a pretty tony address,\u201d Perry mused. He recalled the \u201cfabulous\u201d mansion\u2019s \u201cone square block of manicured lawn.\u201d Now, he and his wife are in a \u201c1,400-square foot, 2 bedroom, 2 bath condo, full of boxes, four dogs\u201d as they wait for their next home to be built. He said it is an \u201cinteresting experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI moved my wife into a 600-square foot, one-room house when we got married, so it\u2019s all relative,\u201d Perry said.\n\nPerry was scheduled to speak later Thursday to a Washington gathering of conservative activists hosted by the American Principles Project, an advocacy group that opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. Gov. Bobby Jindal (R-La.) spoke to the same group over lunch about the Common Core initiative, a nationwide program of educational standards that has become anathema to many on the right.\n\nIn the interview, Perry said that his potential campaign would be founded on policy ideas tied to his record as governor, but he would embrace the process of retail politicking \u2014 the handshakes and shoulder grips \u2014 as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a more than passable retail politician and I think it shows,\u201d Perry said.\n\nOn his way out of the building, Perry lingered for 15 minutes, complimenting a columnist on her stylish glasses, which slightly resembled his own Jean Lafont eyewear.\n\nRobert Costa is a national political reporter at The Washington Post.",

He is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and author of \"Libertarianism, from A to Z.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) -- Following the liberal footsteps of Colorado and Washington, Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia passed ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana this month. Florida's medical marijuana law failed, but only because as a constitutional amendment it needed 60% support; 58% voted in favor of it.\n\nIn 2016, another five to 10 states will likely consider legalization -- possibly Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. It's not surprising. Opinion polls show that marijuana legalization now commands majority support across the country.\n\nDo these developments mean that full legalization is inevitable?\n\nNot necessarily, but one would hope so. Marijuana legalization is a policy no-brainer. Any society that professes to value liberty should leave adults free to consume marijuana.\n\nMoreover, the evidence from states and countries that have decriminalized or medicalized marijuana suggests that policy plays a modest role in limiting use. And while marijuana can harm the user or others when consumed inappropriately, the same applies to many legal goods such as alcohol, tobacco, excessive eating or driving a car.\n\nRecent evidence from Colorado confirms that marijuana's legal status has minimal impact on marijuana use or the harms allegedly caused by use. Since commercialization of medical marijuana in 2009, and since legalization in 2012, marijuana use, crime, traffic accidents, education and health outcomes have all followed their pre-existing trends rather than increasing or decreasing after policy liberalized.\n\nThe strong claims made by legalization critics are not borne out in the data. Likewise, some strong claims by legalization advocates -- e.g., that marijuana tourism would be a major boom to the economy -- have also not materialized.\n\nThe main impact of Colorado's legalization has been that marijuana users can now purchase and use with less worry about harsh legal ramifications.\n\nYet despite the compelling case for legalization, and progress toward legalization at the state level, ultimate success is not assured.\n\nFederal law still prohibits marijuana, and existing jurisprudence (Gonzales v. Raich 2005) holds that federal law trumps state law when it comes to marijuana prohibition. So far, the federal government has mostly taken a hands-off approach to state medicalizations and legalizations, but in January 2017, the country will have a new president. That person could order the attorney general to enforce federal prohibition regardless of state law.\n\nWhether that will happen is hard to forecast.\n\nIf more states legalize marijuana and public opinion continues its support, Washington may hesitate to push back. But federal prohibition creates problems even if enforcement is nominal: Marijuana business cannot easily use standard financial institutions and transactions technologies such as credit cards; physicians may still hesitate to prescribe marijuana; and medical researchers will still face difficulty in studying marijuana.\n\nTo realize the full potential of legalization, therefore, federal law must change. The best approach is to remove marijuana from the list of drugs regulated by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the federal law that governs prohibition.\n\nStandard regulatory and tax policies would still apply to legalized marijuana, and states would probably adopt marijuana-specific regulations similar to those for alcohol (e.g., minimum purchase ages). State and federal governments might also impose \"sin taxes,\" as for alcohol. But otherwise marijuana would be just another commodity, as it was before the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937.\n\nA more cautious approach would have Congress reschedule marijuana under the CSA.\n\nCurrently, marijuana is in Schedule I, which is reserved for drugs such as heroin and LSD that, according to the CSA, have \"a high potential for abuse ... no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States ... [and] a lack of accepted safety for use.\" Hardly anyone believes these conditions apply to marijuana.\n\nIf marijuana were in Schedule II, which states it as \"a high potential for abuse ... [but a] currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,\" doctors could legally prescribe it under federal law, as with other Schedule II drugs such as cocaine, methadone and morphine.\n\nGiven the broad range of conditions for which marijuana may be useful, including muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, nausea from cancer chemotherapy, poor appetite and weight loss caused by chronic illness such as HIV, chronic pain, stress, seizure disorders and Crohn's disease, doctors would have wide reign to prescribe, making marijuana all but legal as occurs under the broadest state medical marijuana laws, such as California and Colorado.\n\nMedical science would also face fewer regulatory hurdles to marijuana research. This \"medicalization\" approach, while perhaps politically more feasible than full legalization, has serious drawbacks.\n\nFederal authorities such as the Drug Enforcement Administration could interfere with marijuana prescribing -- as sometimes occurs with opiate prescribing. Taxing medical marijuana may be harder than taxing recreational marijuana. And the medical approach risks a charge of hypocrisy, since it is backdoor legalization. But medicalization is still better than full prohibition, since it eliminates the black market.\n\nFor 77 years, the United States has outlawed marijuana, with tragic repercussions and unintended consequences. The public and their state governments are on track to rectify this terrible policy. Here's hoping Congress catches up.\n\nRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.",

    "text": "Editor's note: Send questions for future Mailbags to stewart.mandel@fox.com.\n\nLast week I wrote a column taking a trip down realignment memory lane, and I only wish I'd taken it a few steps further. Given the amount of interest it generated, and given my readers' never-ending interest in the topic in general, I probably should have turned the winners and losers piece into a five-part series.\n\nThanks to the Mailbag, though, we can at least extend this nascent round of realignment nostalgia by another week.\n\nStewart: You recently evaluated the winners and losers from the 2010 conference realignment frenzy. What about over the last 25 years? I use that number since this month marks 25 years since Penn State joined the Big Ten. Jim Delany recently said, \"With all the other expansions around the country, I'm not sure there was one that benefitted both institution and conference as much as this did.\" Do you agree?\n\nReally, the entirety of modern realignment can be traced to when Penn State joined the Big Ten. As natural a fit as the two seem now, the move seemed outrageous at the time. After all, Pennsylvania's not in the Midwest, and the Big Ten was supposed to have ... um, 10 teams. Penn State's addition, coming at a time when Joe Paterno's program was an unquestioned power, bolstered the conference's brand and made it college sports' most desired TV property. And Penn State no longer had to subsist largely in the football wasteland of the Northeast. Wisconsin may be far away, but Penn State has more in common with Wisconsin than Temple.\n\nThe only reason I'd question whether this has indeed been the most mutually beneficial conference-university marriage is because Penn State football peaked shortly upon joining. Its undefeated 1994 campaign came in its second season in the league. Save for a couple high points since then (the 2005 Orange and 2008 Rose Bowl teams) the Nittany Lions have not significantly bolstered the actual on-field product. They've won the same number of Big Ten championships (three) as Northwestern during the same span. And of course the Jerry Sandusky scandal and ensuing sanctions hurt the entire league.\n\nInstead, I would take Delany's quote and apply it to Florida State and the ACC, a move announced 25 years ago this September as part of the TV consolidation wave ushered in by the Big Ten/Penn State union. The ACC to that point had almost no football visibility. FSU was quickly emerging as a behemoth. This quote at the time from then-ACC commissioner Gene Corrigan is telling: \"Their football team had more national television exposure last year than all our teams had together.\"\n\nBobby Bowden has said many times that he steered the 'Noles to the ACC instead of the SEC because he felt he'd have a better chance of winning a national championship. And he was right. His teams won crowns in 1993 and '99, all the while running roughshod over the rest of the conference. Eventually the 'Noles' dominance motivated other programs like Clemson to raise their game. It also paved the way for the ACC's second expansion a decade later.\n\nBoth schools' moves were the beginning of the end for independents. In 1990 there were 26. Today there are three. Here's a random nugget: Of those 26, 15 subsequently joined two or more conferences. Louisville alone has competed in four (Conference USA, the Big East, the American and the ACC).\n\nGod bless realignment -- but solely for Mailbag purposes.\n\nSo five years after realignment hell broke loose, and after five years of Texas being the picture of mediocrity, what do you think? Did Texas make the right move by staying in the Big 12, a conference that seems to be an afterthought of the Power 5? Or do you think it would have been better off moving to the Pac-10 or SEC?\n\n-- Gerard, New Milford, Conn.\n\nSometimes it's hard to see the bigger picture midstream. Yes, Texas has sunk into mediocrity since that decision to remain in the Big 12 -- but there's almost no causation between the two (unless you think the 'Horns should have moved west to escape Baylor's offense.) Case McCoy and Tyrone Swoopes would have struggled whether they were facing Oklahoma State or Oregon State. In that winners and losers column I tried to avoid rendering judgments based on a few seasons of football performances and rather based on likely long-term potential.\n\nSelfishly, I would have loved to see Texas and Oklahoma come west, but realistically, Texas made the right move staying put. It gets to continue being the big bully ... er, fish, in its small pond rather than one of many voices in a 16-team conference. It's one of two legacy programs in a conference rather than being one of many in the SEC (which gladly would have taken the 'Horns). And those other leagues likely wouldn't have allowed the Longhorn Network, which is putting $300 million in Texas' coffers. I also don't buy the Big 12 as an afterthought. It may seem that way after last year's playoff snub and/or because Baylor and TCU are the current darlings. If Charlie Strong ever gets the 'Horns in order, their conference affiliation won't prevent them from contending nationally.\n\nWhat scenario would it take for BYU to get into the Pac-12, as crazy as it may seem? If there is no scenario, what's the hang-up? BYU trying to go to the Big 12 just doesn't make sense when the obvious geographic and competitive choice (that already added their long-time rival) is the cute girl next door. Yes, BYU has its scheduling quirks and (unfairly placed, if you ask some) negative academic baggage, but wouldn't their huge fan base overcome that?\n\nChalk that one up to a lack of \"cultural fit.\" Simply put, BYU is a conservative, religious university; the Pac-12 mostly consists of large state schools (save for Stanford and USC) and includes some of the most liberal enclaves in the country (Berkeley, Palo Alto, L.A., Seattle and the state of Oregon). Normally I scoff whenever any commissioner or president claims a realignment move is driven by anything other than athletics and TV households, but in this case it's very real. Ultimately the presidents and chancellors, not Larry Scott, approve any new members, and it's hard to imagine the leaders of Cal or Stanford signing off on BYU. Whether that's fair, or possibly discriminatory, is a whole other matter.\n\nFurthermore, BYU, like Texas, brings its own television network to the table. Granted, BYUtv serves a much different purpose than the Longhorn Network, but the channel does air 125 Cougars sporting events, according to its Web site. That would not fly with the Pac-12 Network model, for which the schools hand over all their Tier 3 rights. I doubt the league would make an exception for BYU. (It wouldn't for Texas when the two parties flirted the second time in 2011.) All of which makes the Big 12 a more sensible fit for BYU, especially given that league has a better chance (albeit still a small one) of expanding any time soon.\n\nStewart, like the TV show \"Lost\", the college football world flashes to an alternate existence where massive realignment does not occur but the four-team playoff does. The 2014 season might have looked like this: Baylor earns a playoff spot with its Big 12 championship win over Missouri. Ohio State makes the playoff by beating B1G West champ Notre Dame (who joins a conference and makes the B1G an even 12 members) and TCU earns a New Year's Six bowl berth by being the best Group of 5 school. Oregon, Alabama and Big East champ West Virginia sweat it out on Selection Sunday for the final two playoff spots.\n\n-- Scott Saxton, Windsor, Ontario\n\nI just love that the alternate scenario where \"massive realignment does not occur\" still involves Notre Dame joining a conference -- the one domino that did not happen. I'm also confused why Baylor wound up a surer playoff bet than Oregon and Alabama, how the 8-5 Irish won their division and why West Virginia, not Cincinnati or Louisville, won the Big East.\n\nSo all in all, this flash-sideways concept, like \"Lost's\", seemed fun at first but was mostly unsatisfying. A better challenge would be to devise a fantasy realignment scenario that ends in as equally absurd yet technically possible fashion as the recent \"VEEP\" season finale.\n\nHi Stewart, Your Mailbag gets me through the work week, especially in the offseason. This year's College Football Playoff schedule has come out and ... it stinks. Just like your book predicted (which I just finished), the ratings and fan attendance for the New Years Eve bowls will be way down this year. I'll have to somehow stream them from the office at 10:00 a.m. (Peach Bowl) and 2 p.m. (first semifinal) Mountain time. Maybe I should just hope Arizona makes the Rose Bowl instead of the playoff (I would happily take either).\n\nWell first of all, thanks for reading the book. Perhaps if more people had then the Dec. 31 semifinals would not have come as such a shock when much of the public finally noticed them for the first time right after last year's games. And I'm seeing the same doom-and-gloom predictions you are about what a nightmare it will be. Even ESPN (which didn't devise the rotation) knows ratings will be down for the semifinals from last year's Jan. 1 doubleheader. I believe it will be particularly bad on the West Coast, where college football is not as intrinsic to the culture as the South or Midwest. In Silicon Valley, in particular, most businesses will be oblivious to the football game taking place, as they're oblivious to anything besides developer conferences and iPhone launches.\n\nBut after this one rough year, my guess is Dec. 31 playoff games will soon seem normal. The event is so popular -- 28 million people watched last year's semifinals -- that it can't help but drive behavioral changes. Case in point: I watched last year's USA-Belgium World Cup game -- which started at 1 p.m. PT on a Tuesday -- at an overflowing sports bar in Manhattan Beach. I'm guessing those people had jobs. Overall, a staggering 16.5 million viewers tuned in. And that's for the other kind of football, which, while rapidly gaining popularity in this country, still lags far behind the sport featured in this column.\n\nMy guess is that come Dec. 31, 2016, when the Peach and Fiesta bowls host the semis, ratings will be back up to what they were this past year.\n\nHey Stewart: You recently wrote that with the playoff, teams on the cusp of being super-elite, like Oregon, would have a more difficult time winning a national championship. How do you view Michigan State?\n\nI view the Spartans much the same way. They've now won at least 11 games four of the past five seasons, beating both a 12-0 Ohio State team and Pac-12 champion Stanford in 2013 as well as a top-five Baylor team in last year's Cotton Bowl. But Mark Dantonio is doing it for the most part by developing underrated recruits. I recently noticed that Michigan State currently has a top-six recruiting class for 2016, which I assumed at first to mean that all its recent success is garnering more coveted prospects. Take a closer look, though, and two-thirds of its 18 commits are three-stars. Those are their guys, a few of which will inevitably blossom into the next Tony Lippett and Shilique Calhoun.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with that formula, as the Spartans have clearly shown they're capable of beating some of the best teams in the country on a given day. And Michigan State could well reach the playoff this season, as I discussed last week. But like Oregon, I wouldn't like their chances of winning consecutive playoff games against opponents likely to be more talented than them. That won't be the case if they draw a TCU or Baylor in the semifinal, but it will if, say, it's Auburn in the semis and USC in the championship game.\n\nWho would win in a five-minute rib eating contest between Pat Forde, Bruce Feldman, Andy Staples and yourself?\n\n-- Vomo Vomacka, West Des Moines, Iowa\n\nClearly Andy would win, and even stop to take pictures of it, but Pat would come close. Bruce would finish whatever gets put in front of him then immediately regret it. I'd idiotically fill up on sides.\n\nHi Stewart, Do you have as big of a problem as I do with Brian Kelly's recent comments? He feels his athletes are at a disadvantage because of the academic requirements at Notre Dame. I feel it's unfair that these athletes are even accepted to Notre Dame. If a regular student can't get into a school because of the academic standards, I don't feel it's fair for someone to get in just because they play a sport well, let alone go for free.\n\n-- Kyle Zartman, St. Louis\n\nWell first of all, I hope you realize this is hardly unique to Notre Dame. Nearly every football-playing school in the country admits athletes that would not be accepted solely on their academic credentials. I would not categorize it as unfair, because universities set their own respective parameters for who they want to comprise their student body. But it's certainly ripe for abuse, as Notre Dame has experienced recently. And in Notre Dame's case, its fans expect national titles. That's not going to happen if they recruit only players who could get in on their own.\n\nI actually found Kelly's surprisingly candid comments to be refreshing. Usually coaches and administrators tiptoe around this widespread practice, and in fact some of Kelly's predecessors at Notre Dame would have you believe they were trotting out a roster full of valedictorians. Or they would use the school's academic requirements as an excuse for the Irish's on-field struggles, as if they weren't recruiting much the same pool of blue-chippers as Alabama or Ohio State.\n\nTo be clear, Kelly's program has no shortage of sharp, academically serious students. I made two visits there last season and enjoyed my conversations with several players. Which shows that while there's a risk to accepting athletes who don't meet the school's typical admissions threshold, most of those athletes take advantage of the opportunity afforded them.\n\nStewart, I read your article about the realignment winners and losers. I agree with most of your opinions, with one exception. USF was a member of the Big East for as long as UC and UConn. Did they lose any less than those two schools when their BCS status was taken away?\n\n-- James R.

    "text": "Over the weekend Nicholas Carlson published a telling look at how eBay has turned itself around. The Business Insider piece offers plenty of lessons in what it takes to shake up a huge company. The focus of the story is Jack Abraham, who reinvented eBay\u2019s Web page as a feed, which has led to more visits, clicks and time spent on the site.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable is Abraham\u2019s approach to the project. He recruited five talented co-workers to board a plane with him to Sydney, with no hotel rooms or a workspace booked. He just went for it, as Carlson explains:\n\nNo one at the eBay office knew they were coming.\n\n\u201cAre you here to see someone?\u201d the receptionist asked suspiciously.\n\nAbraham leaned over the desk. \u201cWe\u2019re actually here on a secret mission from [CEO] John Donahoe,\u201d he told her conspiratorially, \u201cand we\u2019d just love it if we could get a conference room for a few days. Could you possibly help us out with that?\u201d\n\nFor Abraham, getting out of his typical environment was essential. He wanted to be off the radar.\n\nThere\u2019s a boldness, brashness and optimism to Abraham. He never appears to be thinking about what could go wrong. He doesn\u2019t worry if everything isn\u2019t planned out. His life mantras appear to be \u201cmove fast and break things,\u201d and \u201cbetter to ask forgiveness than permission.\u201d For example:\n\neBay had given the startup some prime office space on its Campbell, Calif. campus. But it was full of cubicles, and Abraham hated cubicles. So, at a meeting with all of Milo\u2019s employees, he rallied the team to join him in tearing the cubicles down and tossing them out onto the lawn.\n\n\u201cI got a very angry call from facilities about that,\u201d says Abraham.\n\nCarlson describes Abraham\u2019s moments of inspiration as \u201cmanic bursts of risk-taking and productivity.\u201d That mania reminded me of the famous quote in an Apple ad: \u201cThe people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.\u201d If you find yourself trying to do something big, bold and different at your company, remember Abraham\u2019s crazy methods. They work.",

Next week, the mythical device is likely to be unleashed.\n\nAmazon's (AMZN, Fortune 500) PR firm sent an invitation to journalists midday Friday announcing a press conference in New York City on September 28. The e-mail did not include any details, but the the date matches up with the expected timeline for the Amazon tablet's release.\n\nFor a device that hasn't yet been released, the Amazon tablet has already received a lot of media play. Earlier this month, TechCrunch's MG Siegler wrote that he had used the tablet.\n\nThe tablet runs on a tweaked version of Android, has a 7-inch tablet touch screen and is backlit, Siegler wrote, concluding that it's \"going to be a big deal. Huge, potentially.\"\n\nAnalysts have even made sales forecasts about the yet-to-exist tablet, with Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps writing way back in March that the market is ripe for disruption from Amazon.\n\nLate last month, Rotman Epps released another report titled \"Amazon Will Be Apple's Top Competitor in Tablets.\" Within a year, she predicts, \"'Amazon' will be synonymous with 'Android' on tablets.\"\n\nThe key is for Amazon to \"compete on price, content, and commerce,\" Rotman Epps says. If Amazon hits the right price point -- one that significantly undercuts the iPad -- and can keep up enough supply to meet demand, she expects Amazon's tablet will \"easily\" sell 3 million to 5 million units in the fourth quarter.\n\nBy comparison, Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) sold 3.27 million iPads in the tablet's first quarter of existence. In its latest quarter, which ended June 30, Apple sold 9.3 million iPads.\n\nIf Amazon can unseat Apple as the tablet king -- or even make a dent, really -- it will have pulled off what several others have largely failed to do.\n\nIn the most extreme example, HP (HPQ, Fortune 500) killed off its TouchPad last month after just 49 days on the market. Other rivals are hanging on, but most of their devices have flopped critically and commercially.\n\nBlackBerry maker Research in Motion (RIMM) released its PlayBook tablet in April to harsh reviews criticizing the device's unfinished feel. Two Android-based tablets -- Samsung's Galaxy Tab and Motorola's (MMI) Xoom -- debuted at prices above the iPad's $499 price point. Their sales have disappointed.",

One arm was rammed back unnaturally, broken. Panicked parkgoers struggled to free her from a huge tree limb that had plummeted 30 feet.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d she screamed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\nMs. Handwerker, a 29-year-old social worker, survived the July 2007 accident with grievous injuries, and sued. Her lawyers pieced together evidence that untrained parks workers had missed signs that the elm was rotting \u2014 even though the 80-foot tree, one of the biggest in New York City, had sent limbs crashing down before. The city settled in February, paying $4 million.\n\nMs. Handwerker\u2019s suit is just one of at least 10 stemming from deaths or injuries caused by falling limbs and branches in New York City that were quietly resolved over the last 10 years, or are now winding their way through the courts. The city has paid millions of dollars in damage claims, with far more expected. It all comes at a time of steep cutbacks in the amount of money the city dedicates to tree care and safety.\n\nLawyers and investigators hired by the victims have gathered parks records, taken sworn testimony from city officials and parks workers, and hired tree-care experts to review city procedures. The collected evidence, taken together with public records and interviews with outside experts and parks officials, depicts an overstretched and haphazard system of tree inspections and care, one in which the crucial job of spotting dangers can be left to untrained workers, and repairs and pruning are delayed to save money.\n\nAt the center of many of the cases is a simple question: how much responsibility does the city have for protecting people who pass beneath its graceful elms, oaks and maples? Lawyers for the injured and dead have argued for more, while lawyers for the city have argued for less; in at least two recent cases, the city\u2019s position has been rejected by appeals courts.\n\nCity lawyers have aggressively fought several of the cases, denying blame in what they called tragic accidents. They argued that the city was not required to regularly conduct state-of-the-art inspections to determine whether trees were rotting or disease-ridden.\n\nNew York effectively has two tree-care systems, one for Central Park, with its mix of private and public financing, and one for the rest of the city. But the suits demonstrated safety problems in each:\n\n\u00b6 In two of the most high-profile Central Park cases \u2014 the life-altering injury of a young Google engineer in 2009 and the death of a restaurant worker seven months later \u2014 workers noted signs of dangers in trees but did not move fast enough. In the case of the engineer, a park official thought he had been told that workers \u201cgot\u201d the dangerous limb before it hurt anyone; in fact, they simply \u201cgot\u201d an e-mail warning of the danger.\n\n\u00b6 Workers did not detect that the huge tree that hit Ms. Handwerker had rotted to the point that its giant trunk was \u201cgooey.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 The parks department\u2019s monitoring of trees in high-hazard areas like public squares, playgrounds and picnic areas has not caught up with an increasingly sophisticated science of managing the well-recognized risks of aging trees.\n\nTree-care experts say the testimony and records raise broad safety questions nationally. Preventive care of urban trees has been a budget casualty from Philadelphia to Chicago to San Jose. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem here and everywhere,\u201d said Douglas Still, the chief city forester in Providence, R.I. \u201cPruning programs are being cut, not increased.\u201d\n\nSome tree-care experts fear cuts will bring more accidents \u2014 and damage payouts. \u201cIt\u2019s an old adage \u2014 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\u201d said Randall Swanson, a forestry professor at Paul Smith\u2019s College in upstate New York. \u201cPreventative measures can go a long way toward reducing the possibility of tree-related injuries.\u201d",

    "text": "\u201cTHE BRADY BUNCH IS LIKE AHAB and the white whale,\u201d says executive producer Sherwood Schwartz, who first conceived of the sitcom\u2014the timeless and endearingly silly story of a man called Brady, his second wife and their six children (the three boys his, the three girls hers)\u2014in 1966. \u201cIt jumps out when you least expect it.\u201d\n\nWell, Schwartz\u2019s whale is back, sopping us all with the mild suburban travails of Greg, Bobby, Peter, Marcia, Jan, Cindy, newlywed parents Mike and Carol, and, of course, Alice, the maid. The series, which aired on ABC from 1969 to 1974 (where it was regularly housed in the Nielsen Top 20), can now be seen in daily reruns on JOO stations. Growing Up Brady, a paperback memoir by Barry Williams, who played oldest son Greg, has sold almost 100,000 copies in the month since it first appeared in bookstores. There is even a hit stage version of the show, a borderline camp production (originating in Chicago, the show is currently in New York City and Los Angeles), in which the casts act out series scripts.\n\nInterest in the series was also heightened\u2014tragically\u2014when Robert Reed, who played architect and paterfamilias Mike Brady, died May 12 at age 59 (PEOPLE, May 25). His death, first attributed simply to colon cancer, was later revealed to have been hastened by AIDS. \u201cThere were a few of us who knew that he was HIV positive, and we protected his privacy,\u201d says Florence Henderson (Reed\u2019s TV wife, Carol Brady).\u201dI really, honestly don\u2019t think everyone on the show knew. I never discussed it with anyone except Barry Williams. The others, even if they had known, would have protected his privacy.\u201d\n\nWilliams and Susan Olsen (Cindy) agree that, for Reed, privacy was paramount. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that he kept that information to himself.\u201d says Williams, who pauses to add, \u201cThis is still emotionally charged for me. My relationship with Bob was as a friend, father and actor.\u201d\n\nAs to how or when Reed could have contracted AIDS, his TV family refuses to speculate. \u201cNobody\u2019s business,\u201d says Olsen, when asked whether Reed\u2014who has a daughter from a marriage that ended in divorce in 1959\u2014was gay. Olsen thinks there\u2019s a more important point for the public: \u201cIf AIDS can happen to Dad Brady, it can happen to you.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in an era in which even sitcom characters must practice safe sex, The Brady Bunch seems still more appealingly unreal than when if first turned up on ABC, \u201ca traditional little show,\u201d as Henderson describes it, \u201cthat came along at the end of the \u201960s, which was a terribly turbulent time.\u201d\n\nThe key to the series\u2019 enduring appeal, according to Henderson, is that The Brady Bunch generated an authentic, home-sweet-home warmth. \u201cIt was one of those rare moments when the chemistry was right for everyone,\u201d she says, \u201cand we grew to love each other. As corny as it sounds, if kinda is like a family.\u201d Virtually the entire cast showed up for Barry Williams\u2019s wedding two years ago in Pacific Palisades, Calif., as well as for the 50th wedding anniversary last year of Sherwood Schwartz and his wife, Mildred.\n\nBy and large, the cast members. who are profiled on the following pages, are good-natured about the way their Brady pasts have continued into the present and, whether they like it or not, will continue into the foreseeable future. (What\u2019s not in the future are residuals, which sitcom actors from that era, for the most part, don\u2019t receive.)\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kill The Brady Bunch,\u201d says Ann B. Davis, who played Alice. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten so much blood out of this turnip, it may not be a turnip.\u201d\n\nGREG, the Luke Perry of the Watergate era, tells all\u2014or a lot\n\nBarry Williams lives in Calabasas, Calif., in a five-bedroom Mediterranean-style house\u2014a nice fit for someone who had that many sitcom siblings. Says Williams, 37, who played tall, dark and adolescent Greg, the oldest Brady child: \u201cI looked at it one day and thought, \u2018Yeah, looks like something Greg would buy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn his den, Williams keeps videotapes of all 116 Brady episodes (plus the pilot), all of which he watched when he was working on his new book, Growing Up Brady (cowritten with Chris Kreski, an MTV editorial director). He cringed when he saw the old show. \u201cOccasionally I\u2019d have to sit down with a glass of wine to watch an episode,\u201d says Williams, currently starring in the touring musical City of Angels. \u201cBut I began to look at it less critically and more affectionately.\u201d\n\nThe oversize paperback is filled with details that Brady maniacs will cherish and share\u2014including the sad fact that Tiger, the shaggy mutt who disappeared from the Brady household early on, actually died after the fourth episode. \u201cHe met his maker under a laundry truck,\u201d Williams says. There are also some Brady bombshells:\n\n1. Williams had a thing for costar Maureen McCormick (Marcia) and once even necked with her in his trailer. \u201cIt was hard not to notice how pretty she was and how attracted I was to her,\u201d says Williams, recalling the days when he (if not Greg) was in high puberty. \u201cThat feeling was shared by hundreds of thousands of young men. And I was there.\u201d Not with any consistency though. \u201cThere were stretches of time when our relationship was professional, and other times we\u2019d find ourselves amorous,\u201d he says. \u201cHot and cold.\u201d\n\n2. In 1970, during the show\u2019s second season, the 15-year-old asked his TV mom, Florence Henderson, then 36, out on a date. \u201cWhen those little things called hormones start kicking in, you get excited by even inanimate objects,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I sought to bed her. I just wanted to spend time with her.\u201d The date, at any rate, never went beyond a pleasant restaurant dinner. \u201cIt was flattering that she gave me any attention at all,\u201d says Williams.\n\n3. One day he came to the set stoned on marijuana. \u201cIt was like reefer madness,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the director knew was I was acting like a jerk. I was changing my line readings, I was wandering around.\u201d\n\nWilliams says he was just plain mad\u2014difficult, resentful\u2014in the lean years after the show was canceled in 1974. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get auditions,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d get generic answers: \u2018You\u2019re a little too tall, a little too young, your feet aren\u2019t wide enough.\u2019 Oh, and \u2018You\u2019re too famous.\u2019 That was my favorite.\u201d He gradually got back on his feet, personally and professionally, with theater roles: Pippin and Romance, Romance on Broadway, and now City of Angels. Two years ago he married Diane Martin, a singer whom he met on a blind date in 1987. Diane is a huge Brady fan. \u201cI\u2019ll be there shaking my head at an episode,\u201d Williams says, \u201cand she\u2019s doubled over with laughter.\u201d\n\nMARCIA has a lovely daughter of her own\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve wanted most in life was to be a mother,\u201d says Maureen McCormick, 35, dandling her 3-year-old daughter, Natalie, on her lap, \u201cand I just decided to really put the energy into it. Now I\u2019m thinking about getting into acting again.\u201d\n\nMcCormick\u2014who, as Marcia, was the closest the Brady girls ever got to statuesque\u2014currently lives in the affluent L.A. suburb of Westlake with her husband of seven years, Michael Cummings, a salesman. Motherhood, suburban home-making, a freshly inked deal with the William Morris talent agency\u2014not all that different from the life that Marcia might have grown up to have, although Cummings had never even heard of Marcia when he met McCormick. \u201cHe had no idea who I was,\u201d says McCormiek, \u201cwhich, I have to say, was very, very refreshing.\u201d (Hard to believe, isn\u2019t it, that lie wouldn\u2019t at least have remembered her from her advice column in Tiger Beat?)\n\nVirtually everyone else, she finds, regards her as an acquaintance. Says McCormick: \u201cI\u2019m getting 3-year-olds coming up and recognizing me.\u201d\n\nPETER pays the piper, then gets into computer software\n\nAs general manager for Visual Software Inc. in Manhattan Beach, Calif., Chris Knight, 34, finds that being recognized as Peter Brady\u2014the middle son, the one with the wide, energetic smile\u2014has its advantages. \u201cI\u2019m instantly trusted,\u201d he says.\n\nThe image, though, didn\u2019t help him over the post-Brady acting hurdles. After the series ended, he attended UCLA for less than a year but dropped out for the abysmal Brady Bunch Variety Hour in 1977. By the early \u201980s, he says, \u201cI worried about just gelling the next job.\u201d That\u2019s when he drilled into what he calls \u201clow-level drug use\u201d\u2014cocaine and pot.\n\nWhen a high school friend pointed Knight toward a sales-rep job four years ago, he was glad to take it. \u201cThe only way to have salvation with this Brady Bunch thing is to leave show business,\u201d says Knight, who has been married for three years to Julie, 26, an office manager for a law firm.\n\nEven now, though, there an; some showbiz memories that bring back the old Peter Brady smile. For instance, Knight reveals, he was not unhappy that it was Peter who got to throw the football pass that bopped stepsister Marcia in the nose. \u201cI got great pleasure out of that,\u201d he laughs. \u201cMaureen was such a priss!\u201d\n\nJAN, plumb tired of things Brady, searches for her next role\n\nEve Plumb is the Greta Garbo of The Brady Bunch\u2014beautiful, elusive and weary. It\u2019s not so much that she wants to be let alone\u2014she did attend the opening of the L.A. production of the Real Live Brady Bunch play in April. It\u2019s just that she doesn\u2019t want to be forever Jan, the middle sister.\n\n\u201cI think Eve just wishes [the Brady phenomenon] would all go away,\u201d says former costar Chris Knight, who gets together with her once a year. \u201cI\u2019d probably be like that myself if I was still trying to butt heads with the industry.\u201d Yes, Plumb is still out there butting: She recently shot a pilot for NBC, Yesterday Today, in which she plays\u2014oh, wow\u2014a mom in the \u201970s (the drama was not picked up for the fall schedule).\n\n\u201cI try to maintain a good altitude,\u201d says Plumb, now a 34-year-old divorc\u00e9e living in Studio City, Calif., \u201cbecause I really can\u2019t do anything about the show.\u201d One thing she did do: The onetime strawberry blonde dyed her hair coppery red, so she isn\u2019t as instantly recognized. \u201cAnd that,\u201d she says, \u201cis good.\u201d\n\nBOBBY winds up in Utah, at the other end of the camera\n\n\u201cWithout The Brady Bunch, my guess is I would have become an engineer working on new plastics or something,\u201d says Mike Lookinland, 31, who was the youngest, perhaps mildest of the Brady boys. Today Lookinland, who studied film at the University of Utah, lives in Salt Lake City with wife Kelly, 29, and their son, Scott, 2. \u201cRight now,\u201d he reports, \u201cI\u2019m a production assistant with Rocky Mountain Pictures [which produces feature films], with an eye on becoming a director of photography.\u201d\n\nIn his late teens\u2014like his brothers-in-television, Williams and Knight\u2014he found life without a sitcom was, in fact, no sitcom. \u201cI did drugs for a while,\u201d he admits. \u201cI went through a lot of things. But then I got married and found a niche in a career I enjoy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t watch the show much,\u201d he adds. \u201cI never stay home to see it, the way I do with The Simpsons.\u201d\n\nCINDY learns that art is long, show business is short\n\n\u201cWe all go through the I-don\u2019t-want-to-be-a-Brady phase,\u201d says Susan Olson, 30, who was 7 when she was cast as the youngest Brady, pigtailed Cindy. \u201cI went through mine. I got over it.\u201d And if the public refuses to forget who she is, at least Olsen finds the humor in perpetual Cindydom. \u201cI would be driving through Burger King,\u201d she says, remembering one earlier bout of Bradymania, \u201cand someone would give me my change and say, \u2018Here\u2019s your change, Cindy Brady.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOlsen, recently divorced from her husband of two years, graphic artist Steven Ventimiglia, is herself a free-lance graphic artist in Sherman Oaks, Calif.\u2014thanks, in part, to The Brady Bunch. The kids\u2019 on-set teacher, Frances Whitfield, gave Olsen her first oil paints. Olsen also credits Paramount executives with keeping the Brady kids from becoming temperamental monsters. \u201cWhen they gave us parking spaces,\u201d she remembers, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t put our names on them.\u201d\n\nOlsen wouldn\u2019t mind getting back into acting; she even has tried to land some commercial jobs for her cat, William. \u201cIt\u2019s just a case of not being able to get arrested in Hollywood,\u201d she says.\n\nALICE doesn\u2019t live here anymore, but she still has to clean up\n\n\u201cAll of us wish we had an Alice,\u201d says Ann B. Davis, better known as Alice Nelson, the ever chipper, ever busy Brady housekeeper. \u201cI wish I had an Alice.\u201d Especially because these days Davis, 66 and living in Ambridge, Pa., finds herself helping out with the chores in the three-bedroom house she shares with William Frey, an Episcopal bishop, and his wife, Barbara. Davis, who met the couple in 1974, first joined them in 1976 in Denver, where Frey had formed a sort of religious group house of 26 parishioners. When Frey became dean of Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry in 1990, Davis decided to go with the family to Ambridge. The three are dedicated to prayer and Bible study.\n\nBy the end of Brady\u2019s run\u2014and after a 40-year showbiz career that included two Emmys for playing peppery gal Friday Schultzy on The Bob Cummings Show in the \u201950s\u2014Davis realized that her life lacked the fundamental contentment of, say, Alice Nelson\u2019s. \u201cI wasn\u2019t satisfied,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, \u2018What is it I haven\u2019t got?\u2019 \u201d She explains the answer with a memory from her childhood in Erie, Pa.: \u201cMy mother would write letters when I was away at camp and say, \u2018There\u2019s an Ann-shaped space around the house. Nobody fills an Ann-shaped space except an Ann.\u2019 I\u2019m convinced we all have a God-shaped space in us, and until we fill that space with God, we\u2019ll never know what it is to be whole.\u201d\n\nUnlike Robert Reed, though, Davis did not consider the show hell on earth. The cast \u201cgot along beautifully,\u201d she says, and adds that as an avid knitter, \u201cI had the boys hooking rugs and the girls doing needlepoint.\u201d Surprisingly, she says, \u201cI basically don\u2019t do that well with children, although my sister [an identical twin, Harriet Norton, a mother of three living in Leonia, N.J.] says I\u2019m a great aunt.\u201d Also unlike Alice, Davis hates to cook: \u201cWhen it\u2019s my turn in the house, we just eat out.\u201d\n\nDavis, never married, still acts occasionally (including a Canadian production of the comedy The Cemetery Club last year) but lives comfortably on her Screen Actors Guild pension. (She recently bought a bright red Mazda Miata.) And she takes classes\u2014aerobics in town, theology at the seminary.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious,\u201d she says, \u201cI am where the Lord wants me to be.\u201d\n\nCAROL sails off on a love boat with her new husband\n\n\u201cWho would ever think the Bradys would still be going?\u201d marvels Florence Henderson, 58, eternally upbeat den-mother-for-the-ages Carol Brady. \u201cWho would have thought I\u2019d be living on a boat?\u201d\n\nFor the past five years, Henderson\u2014still very much \u201cthe lovely lady\u201d of the show\u2019s theme song\u2014has dropped anchor in Marina Del Rey, Calif. There she shares a 75-foot power yacht with her second husband, hypnotherapist John Kappas, 66, who runs the Hypnosis Motivation Institute in nearby Tarzana. Henderson\u2014who has four grown children from her first marriage, to Ira Bernstein, a theatrical manager from whom she was divorced eight years ago\u2014met Kappas in 1982, when she sought help to overcome her fear of flying and a bout of stage fright that she had developed post-Brady. She has since become a certified hypnotherapist herself, although she doesn\u2019t practice. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a career,\u201d she says, \u201cI would do that full-time.\u201d\n\nThat career is stronger than most of the Bradys\u2019: Henderson is in her 17th year touting \u201cWessonality\u201d for Wesson Oil. For eight years she has been host of Florence Henderson\u2019s Country Kitchen, a cooking show on the Nashville Network. And this year she had an odd cameo, as a greasepaint-smeared groupie who seduces Bobcat Goldthwait in his film comedy Shakes the Clown.\n\nThe tryst with Shakes, in any event, was wilder than her now celebrated 1970 dale with Williams, who played her stepson Greg. Henderson recalls that Barry\u2019s brother, Craig, drove and that Barry kissed her goodnight\u2014\u201da sweet little kiss on the cheek or something. I can\u2019t even remember,\u201d says Henderson. \u201cI was never interested in young boys, and besides, I was married. I think Barry also dated my daughter, Barbara. I think he dated everyone.\u201d\n\nTOM GLIATTOMARIA EFTIMIADES in Detroit and Pittsburgh, ANDREW ABRAHAMS and KATHRYN BAKER in Los Angeles, JERRY JOHNSTON in Salt Lake City",

    "text": "As Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s campaign tries to move past a recently released 2005 tape of his lewd remarks about women, more video of similar comments made by Trump is surfacing.\n\nIn an \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d Christmas feature in 1992, Trump looked at a group of young girls and said he would be dating one of them in ten years. At the time, Trump would have been 46 years old.\n\nThe video, released Wednesday evening, was shot at Trump Tower.\n\nIn the clip, Trump asks one of the girls if she\u2019s \u201cgoing up the escalator.\u201d When the girl replies, \u201cyeah,\u201d Trump turns to the camera and says: \u201cI am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?\u201d\n\nIt is not the first time Trump has made reference to his interest in dating much younger women.\n\nIn 2006, he made a similar comment about his own daughter, Ivanka Trump: \u201cI\u2019ve said that if Ivanka weren\u2019t my daughter, perhaps I\u2019d be dating her,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe issue ballooned when 2005 video from \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d revealed lewd banter between Trump and entertainment reporter Billy Bush, who has since been suspended by NBC.\n\nThe GOP candidate has defended his remarks as \u201clocker room banter,\u201d apologizing for his suggestion that \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star\u201d you can \u201cgrab [women] by the p****.\u201d \u201cYou can do anything,\u201d as he said in the 2005 tape.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump insisted it was all \u201cjust words\u201d and that he had never groped a woman.\n\nBut at least three women have now come forward to contest that dismissal, telling news organizations he groped them in personal encounters at his home, at Trump Tower in New York, and on a commercial flight. Trump\u2019s campaign said late Wednesday that it would file a lawsuit against the New York Times over a story published by the paper earlier that day, with the accounts of two of the women.\n\nAlso Wednesday, People magazine published an account by one of its reporters who recalled Trump \u201cpushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat\u201d during an interview session at his Mar-a-Lago home. The alleged attack, according to reporter Natasha Stoynoff, came as Trump\u2019s wife Melania, who was then pregnant, changed into a different outfit in another room before they continued their joint interview. The encounter was in 2005, the same year the now-infamous encounter with Billy Bush was recorded, according to Stoynoff.\n\nMeanwhile, a former beauty queen is confirming Donald Trump\u2019s own words about walking into pageant dressing rooms unannounced, following recently resurfaced audio recordings where Trump boasted about his ability to do so as the owner of the Miss USA pageant.\n\nTasha Dixon, who competed as Miss Arizona in 2001, told CBS\u2019 Los Angeles station that the GOP nominee had entered dressing rooms while her fellow contestants were \u201chalf naked.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half naked changing into our bikinis,\u201d Dixon said in an interview with KCAL 9. \u201cHe just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked.\u201d\n\nIn audio from Howard Stern\u2019s radio show in 2005, Trump could be heard discussing how he would use his position of power in the pageants to peek at women while they were undressed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go backstage before a show and everyone\u2019s getting dressed and ready and everything else. And you know, no men are anywhere. And I\u2019m allowed to go in because I\u2019m the owner of the pageant. And therefore, I\u2019m inspecting it. You know I\u2019m inspecting it. I want to make sure everything is good,\u201d Trump told Stern at the time. \u201cYou know they\u2019re standing there with no clothes. Is everybody OK? And you see these incredible looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that.\u201d",

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF \"Cost of Freedom Recap\" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.\n\nLAWMAKERS FOCUS ON BUDGET CUTS AS FOOD PRICES SOAR: IS THIS A REAL THREAT TO ECONOMY?\n\nScott Brown: When prices rise Super markets and business owners are going to pass that off to the consumers. Then you throw in the scare tactics and it is going to lead to higher costs. They need to stop with the scare tactics and get down to business.\n\nJonathan Hoenig: Yes this is inflation. It is it caused by government and the artificial expansion of the money supply to support all of that deficit spending. Prices go up and the value of people's savings go down and hurts the economy. It's devastating to poor folks and folks on a fixed income and both parties are guilty of this. Goods that cost a thousand Bucks a decade ago cost almost $1,300 today.\n\nWayne Rogers: What is happening isn't good. Inflation kills us all at some point in time. The problem with food prices is wide spread. Supply is low. That means both chicken and beef suffer as a result. When a farmer's cost go up, he will pass it on to the consumer and the consumers pays more.\n\nGary Kaltbaum: For a family of four every dime counts and when they are sitting at the table, everything matters and looking at the checkbook, Jonathan is it right. The fed is printing money and we are seeing inflation. I am worried about the hyper-inflation.\n\nMargie Omero: I have gone around the country and talked to Walmart moms and they express concern about making their dollar stretch and that's true when prices are going up. They are thinking of how much gas they need to go to the cheaper grocery store and where they're going to have to cut back in they buy for the kids. Is it a real concern that Americans feel and they want to make sure in Washington we are hearing the concerns and speaking the language that demonstrates understanding for those concerns.\n\nCHINA'S NEW HACK ATTACKS: IS OUR NATIONAL DEBT PUTTING OUR ECONOMY & NATIONAL SECURITY AT RISK?\n\nJonathan Hoenig: The debt is a threat no matter who we owe it to. We ask why we don't have a back bone with China when it comes to hacking? We haven't even had a back bone with the military threats from Iran. I am not surprised. We should have the guts to stand up and say it is a violation of intellectual property and the United States will not stand for it. It hurts china more than anyone. No wealth will be created for anyone.\n\nScott Brown: If we didn't have that $1.2 trillion that we borrowed from China we would be in a different situation. We'd have less hesitation. We'd be able to say enough is enough. The time for talking is over and we need to draw a line in the sand.\n\nWayne Rogers: Attacks are going to take place regardless. That is it a given. The stuff the administration is talking about where they are going to do something about is bull. They cannot. You can't stop and it is going to happen and you better get used to. You are not going to do anything about the hacking and all of the talk is ranting and raving. It has nothing to do with the real problem.\n\nGary Kaltbaum: Intellectual property theft cost the U.S. $48 billion in 2009. It is it a lot more in this point in time. This can affect all kinds of industry, who knows what they will go after next? But again. What are you going to do and who are you going to prosecute? I think you hack them back twice as hard.\n\nMargie Omero: The President mentioned it in the state of the union. The White House released a strategy report and you have the attorney general talking about it. Sounds like the administration is doing a lot.\n\nNEW LAWS ALLOW JOB SEEKERS TO SUE FOR \"JOBLESS DISCRIMINATION\"\n\nGARY KALTBAUM: The problem is is that it is it a blanket law and affecting all business and another problem is costs are going to go up, and lawsuits are going to be all over the place. It's ridiculous. If I am en employer, I want to hire, whoever I want to hire, it is my business. Part of hiring is if somebody is out of work for a year, I want to know why. This is plain stupidity.\n\nWAYNE RODGERS: I think they mayor of New York is right. The mayor of New York is saying the same thing that Gary is saying. A guy who has made his fortune in the private business and he's unimpeachable in his integrity. He is making one dollar a year to be the mayor of New York and he is governing an ungovernable city and he says this won't work and he's right. It will end up in a lot of lawsuits. If I am an employer I have the right to anybody. By the way, Scott was a United States senator, does that mean because he didn't get elected this time he has no competence? No, it means he's a hell of a guy who can get elected again. So why should that make any difference?\n\nSCOTT BROWN: Wayne thank you, I am a fan of yours too, so thank you. I agree with Mayor Bloomberg, It should be one factor. The employer should have the opportunity and the right to inquire as to what you have been doing. Have you done retraining or part-time or hustling to get re-employed or are you sitting at home doing nothing? I want to hire the person that is hungry and I agree the lawsuits and early Christmas present for plaintiff lawyers. To bring these suits, the cost of business will go up. I feel like employers will just hunker down and just not hire. It's not a good idea.\n\nMARGIE OMERO: I can appreciate the concern about small businesses. I run a small business. I don't want to face lawsuits. It would be tough to fight that. What a lot of voters support is carrot rather than sticks. Encouraging businesses to hire the unemployed through tax breaks or some other incentive because you have folks that are chronically unemployed and we had a recession. how do you get those folks back in the works force. We should be encouraging and making it easier for those folks to get back to work.\n\nJONATHON HOENIG: If it is in the business owner's best interest to hire somebody, they will hire them. They have the right to discriminate. Discrimination is a slur term for judgment. To be a successful business person, you need to have judgment. Especially about to Wayne's point you want to invest your own money and whom you want to hire, whom you want to fire, and laws like this are an insult to man's mind and an individual trying to use his brain to grow his business and hire the best person for the job.\n\nWHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?\n\nGary Kaltbaum: Stock market about to get tricky. Get defensive with companies like Phillip Morris (PM)\n\nWayne Rogers: New Immigration reform will be costly. Lawmakers will have to take from other programs to help pay for this one.\n\nJonathan Hoenig: Make big profits from small companies like WMCR.\n\nGARY KALTBAUM: The problem is is that it is it a blanket law and affecting all business and another problem is costs are going to go up, and lawsuits are going to be all over the place.

    "text": "BEIJING \u2014 Seven kindergarteners and a teacher were stabbed to death and 12 people were injured on Wednesday in an attack at a school in northern China, according to the state news agency Xinhua.\n\nThe attack was one of the deadliest in a bizarre series of attacks on Chinese schoolchildren by apparent lunatics wielding knives and hand tools.\n\nA local man identified as Wu Huanmin, 48, used a kitchen cleaver in the attack on Wednesday, Xinhua said. He killed five boys, two girls and a female teacher, then left the school, returned home and committed suicide, according to provincial security officials.\n\nEleven pupils and one adult were wounded and taken to a hospital in the city of Hanzhong. A nurse answering the phone at the hospital said most of the victims had critical wounds to their heads.\n\n\u201cWe are very busy saving people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said before hanging up.\n\nThe incident occurred about 8 a.m. at a privately run kindergarten in the village of Linchang in Shaanxi Province, Xinhua reported.\n\nThe latest attacks are presumably copycat crimes, and they have ignited fear and outrage among parents. Some parents have spoken of their reluctance to send their children off to school. Some schools have increased security in the aftermath of the attacks; it was not immediately clear whether the Linchang school had done so.\n\nUnlike in the United States, school shootings are rare in China because it is difficult to buy guns of any kind here. Sharp objects and tools are the weapons of choice.\n\nAlthough official Chinese news organizations have been quick to release initial reports on the string of attacks, the government has been carefully censoring subsequent stories, perhaps to prevent other copycat murders, or perhaps to diminish any suggestion of dysfunction within Chinese society. In presenting China as a \u201charmonious society\u201d \u2014 the signature propaganda phrase of President Hu Jintao \u2014 the government often deletes dissonant reports from the Internet and other media platforms.\n\nSome scholars have speculated that the attacks point to the absence of adequate pressure-release valves in a society that is going through significant economic upheaval, where the gap between the wealthy and the destitute is rapidly widening, and where corruption by local officials heightens frustrations among ordinary citizens.\n\nMental illness, too, is rarely acknowledged here, and thus treatment is in short supply.\n\nThe first of the recent wave of attacks took place on March 23, when Zheng Minsheng, 42, stabbed eight primary school students to death in Fujian Province, on China\u2019s eastern coast. After a speedy trial, Mr. Zheng was executed on April 28, the same day that 16 children and their teacher were attacked at a primary school in the southern province of Guangdong.\n\nThe following day, in the city of Taixing, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, 29 kindergarten pupils and three adults were injured by an attacker with a knife Protesting parents took to the streets chanting, \u201cWe want the truth! We want our babies back!\u201d\n\nThe day after that, Xinhua reported, five kindergarteners and a teacher were injured by a man in Shandong Province, also in eastern China. The man beat the five children with a hammer, then doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire with two other children in his arms. The attacker died.\n\nEdward Wong reported from Beijing, and Mark McDonald from Hong Kong. Zhang Jing contributed research from Beijing.",

Fourteen individuals, including nine FIFA officials and five senior executives, have been indicted on U.S. corruption charges.\n\nFIFA\u2019s long-serving president President Sepp Blatter has so far managed to keep himself out of the formal investigation, and has blamed the corruption of individuals under him in the organization for the scandal. However, the scandal continues to creep closer to him: last week, the Swiss-based organization suspended his deputy, secretary-general Jerome Valcke, in connection with allegations of abusing his access to tickets for FIFA events. Valcke has already been implicated in irregularities surrounding the award of the 2010 World Cup to South Africa.\n\nLast week, Uruguayan national Eugenio Figueredo, a former FIFA vice-president, also had his extradition to the U.S. approved by Swiss authorities.

They're serious business, both for the owners and investors who profit from them and for the users who pump hundreds and even thousands of dollars each into creating characters and interacting online.\n\nSecond Life's parent company, Linden Labs, was recently valued at $383 million. The virtual world's economy was at an all-time high when Q1 transactional data was reported last month. And although the economy is virtual, remember these transactions have a basis in very real funds.\n\nThe lawsuit gives rise to the question: Who owns virtual goods, the creators of the goods or the people who have paid virtual currency for them?\n\nThe users are claiming that Linden Labs and Founder Philip Rosedale persuaded them to invest money and pay a sort of \"property tax\" with the promise of actual ownership of virtual land. Now, the users say, the terms of service have been changed without their prior knowledge or consent. They say the new terms \"state that these land and property owners did not own what they had created, bought and paid for, and that these consumers had no choice but to click on a new terms of service agreement or they could not have access to their property.\" Moreover, the group alleges that Linden Labs froze user accounts and deleted or converted non-virtual currency and virtual property without giving any explanation or avenues for recourse.\n\nWe've contacted Mr. Rosedale for comment and will update this post as new information becomes available.\n\nWhat do you think: Is this a frivolous lawsuit over a virtual non-issue?

Kerry was in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, meeting delegations of Arab diplomats as the Obama administration attempts to cobble together a coalition of allies to confront the threat of the Islamic State. There are no illusions that the task ahead will be easy, and President Obama stressed in his Wednesday night speech the vital role Arab states have to play in breaking the terror organization's insurgency.\n\nThe active cooperation of Saudi Arabia, with its vast oil wealth, its well-equipped military and its broader influence among the Middle East's Sunni states, is key to any extended U.S. war effort in Iraq and Syria, as The Post's Anne Gearan reports from Jiddah. Though long an incubator of the Salafist ideology that now inflames the Islamic State and militant groups of its ilk, the kingdom has grown increasingly concerned with the destabilizing chaos the Islamic State has wrought in the region.\n\nBut that doesn't mean its state ideology is necessarily changing. The country is notorious for its draconian laws, which are derived from a strict Wahhabist interpretation of Islamic doctrine. In the space of two weeks last month, according to the rights group Amnesty International, Saudi Arabia executed as many as 22 people. At least eight of those executed were beheaded, U.N. observers say.\n\nIt appears that the majority of those executed in August were guilty of nonlethal crimes, including drug trafficking, adultery, apostasy and \"sorcery.\" Four members of one family, Amnesty reports, were beheaded for \"receiving drugs.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia is conspicuous in being the sole country to regularly carry out beheadings; last year, a reported shortage of trained swordsmen led to some hope that the practice could wane, but recent evidence suggests otherwise. It's an uncomfortable irony given that the United States' current military mobilization was triggered after the Islamic State beheaded two American journalists.\n\n\"Beheading as a form of execution is cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and prohibited under international law under all circumstances,\" said Juan M\u00e9ndez, a U.N. special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, at a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday.\n\nBeyond the grisliness of the method of punishment, observers also point to the unjust ways in which those who face death penalties are found guilty.\n\n\"The execution of people accused of petty crimes and on the basis of \u2018confessions\u2019 extracted through torture has become shamefully common in Saudi Arabia. It is absolutely shocking to witness the Kingdom\u2019s authorities' callous disregard to fundamental human rights,\" Amnesty's Said Boumedouha said in a statement circulated last week.\n\nIn violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Saudi Arabia executed at least one person under the age of 18 this year, according to Amnesty International. At least half of all executions in Saudi Arabia since 1985 have involved foreign nationals, including domestic workers, whose harsh treatment under Saudi law has riled rights groups in the past.\n\n\"Despite several calls by human rights bodies, Saudi Arabia continues to execute individuals with appalling regularity and in flagrant disregard of international law standards,\" said Christof Heyns, another U.N. rapporteur. In July, the United Nations also condemned Saudi Arabia's \"continuing trend of harassment\" of human rights advocates in the country.\n\nU.S. politicians, including the outspoken Sen. John McCain, routinely hector over the state of human rights in Iran \u2014 Saudi Arabia's main geopolitical rival in the Middle East and a country with a far more democratic political system than that of the Saudis. But they are more quiet about the many abuses carried out in the kingdom.\n\nIshaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

    "text": "(GENEVA)\u2014A month away from a nuclear deal deadline, U.S. and Iranian diplomats tried to narrow differences over how quickly to ease economic penalties against Tehran and how significantly the Iranians must open up military facilities to international inspections.\n\nThe talks between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif lasted six hours. Officials described the negotiating round that officials described as the most substantive since world powers and Iran clinched a framework pact in April.\n\nThat agreement, however, left big questions unanswered, which weeks of subsequent technical discussions have done little to resolve. It was unclear how much progress Kerry and Zarif made before the Iranian delegation began leaving for Tehran.\n\nAsked about completing the full accord by June 30, Zarif said, \u201cWe will try.\u201d\n\nWorld powers believe they have secured Iran\u2019s acquiescence to a combination of nuclear restrictions that would fulfill their biggest goal: keeping Iran at least a year away from bomb-making capability for at least a decade. But they are less clear about how they will ensure Iran fully adheres to any agreement.\n\nVarious Iranian officials, including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, have pledged to limit access to or even block monitors from sensitive military sites and nuclear scientists suspected of previous involvement in covert nuclear weapons efforts.\n\nThe U.S. says such access must be guaranteed or there will be no final deal. A report Friday by the U.N. nuclear agency declared work essentially stalled on its multiyear probe of Iran\u2019s past activities.\n\nThe Iranians are not fully satisfied, either.\n\nThe unresolved issues include the pace at which the United States and other countries will provide Iran relief from international sanctions \u2014 Tehran\u2019s biggest demand \u2014 and how to \u201csnap back\u201d punitive measures into place if the Iranians are caught cheating.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has used the \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism as a main defense of the proposed pact from sharp criticism from Congress and some American allies.\n\nExactly how rapidly the sanctions on Iran\u2019s financial, oil and commercial sectors would come off in the first place lingers as a sore point between Washington and Tehran.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Kerry\u2019s talks with Zarif, senior State Department officials described Iranian transparency and access, and questions about sanctions, as the toughest matters remaining.\n\nThey cited \u201cdifficult weeks\u201d since the April 2 framework reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, but said diplomats and technical experts are getting back on a \u201csmooth path.\u201d\n\nNone of the officials was authorized to be quoted by name and they demanded anonymity.\n\nIran insists it is solely interested in peaceful energy, medical and research purposes, though many governments around the world suspect it of harboring nuclear weapons ambitions. The U.S. estimates the Iranians are currently less than three months away from assembling enough nuclear material for a bomb if they chose to covertly develop one.",

    "text": "Hollywood's hokey horror shows pale by comparison.\n\nIt might seem trite to compare what happened here on the afternoon of April 15, 2013, to a movie. But several survivors said that was exactly how they perceived it; they saw themselves as the players in a war or horror movie as their flesh burned, their stomachs churned and their ears rang, muffling the screams of others. They were shocked, confused, devastated.\n\nThe special effects were real, and it took time for that to sink in.\n\nThere is no wondering who is responsible. Tsarnaev did it. Even his lawyer says so. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, packed two pressure cookers with gunpowder, nails and ball bearings and set them off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.\n\n\"It was the type of bomb favored by terrorists because it's designed to tear people apart and create a bloody spectacle,\" prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors in his opening statement.\n\nProsecutors revealed this week that Tsarnaev stood for four minutes behind a crowd near the Forum restaurant on Boylston Street before detonating his bomb. A photo shows Henry, Jane and Martin Richard in front of him, leaning against a barricade. Jane, who was 6, lost a leg. Martin, 8, took the brunt of the blast. It tore his body apart.\n\n\"Martin Richard was only 4 feet, 5 inches tall and he weighed only 70 pounds,\" prosecutor Weinreb said. The bomb blew open Martin's chest and abdomen, \"exposing his ribs and organs.\" It tore his arm from his body and drove nails and BBs into his legs. The boy bled to death on the sidewalk.\n\nLingzi Lu, a grad student from China, trembled and vomited before bleeding to death.\n\nRestaurant manager Krystle Cambell's lower extremities were mangled and her body shredded by hot shrapnel. She said her legs hurt, then died clasping a friend's hand.\n\nAll the defense can do is ask the jury to consider how things got so bad for Tsarnaev that blowing people up with gunpowder, nails and metal shards could seem a worthy endeavor for a holy cause.\n\nBut it is not his turn, not yet. That will come later.\n\nBoston bombing trial: Life or death? 01:49\n\nNow is the time when survivors of the blasts, as well as the rest of Boston, are engaging in a sort of cleansing ritual. They come to court to face the man who did this to them, and to their city.\n\nTheir prosthetic limbs gleam in the bright courthouse hallways, catching light from the two-story windows overlooking Boston Harbor.\n\nAs the survivors of Tsarnaev's bombs tell their stories, each one is compelling, heartbreaking on its own. Taken as a whole, knowing they are but a sample, this testimony speaks to overwhelming, unfathomable loss.\n\nSome people in the courtroom, including jurors, are moved to tears as one person after another describes the smoke, the shattered bones and eardrums, the muffled sounds and sickening smells.\n\nEvery horror movie begins the same way: The central characters are happy, the sun is shining and there's nary a hint of the darkness and evil about to befall them. When the horror comes, it is so staggeringly awful, you can't take it all in.\n\nApril 15, 2013, was perfect for a marathon. It was a bright, breezy Patriots Day holiday. School was out. It was Opening Day at Fenway Park. A lot of people planned to make it a day in downtown Boston.\n\n\"It was a good day to run, and a good day to watch,\" said Thomas Grilk, executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, which puts on the marathon. In 2013, 27,000 people registered to run.\n\n\"The crowds are loud, boisterous, they love the marathon,\" said Boston police officer Frank Chiola, who has worked the marathon detail for nine years. \"They hang out, cheer. It's a good day for everybody.\"\n\nOn the sidewalk, under the flags fluttering across the street from Marathon Sports, Jeff Bauman was jostled by a guy in a black jacket and ballcap, wearing a backpack. He thought the guy was a little off. He didn't seem to be having a good time like everybody else.\n\nA few minutes later, he saw the backpack on the pavement. A thought flashed through his mind: This is like those suspicious packages they talk about at the airport.\n\n\"You're in Boston, you know, that stuff doesn't happen,\" he told a friend. But he started thinking it was a good idea to get out of there.\n\nBOOM! It was 2:39 p.m., and a flash of white light was followed by a fireball and a plume of smoke. Something had happened in front of Marathon Sports. Twelve seconds later, BOOM! Another a block and a half away, in front of the Forum restaurant. This blast seemed larger and louder than the first.\n\n\"I remember there was a loud explosion, lots of white smoke, people running, screaming,\" said Chiola, the police officer.\n\n\"At one point afterward there was a silence and then the screaming began.\"\n\nHe was running toward the first blast when he heard the second. But he kept going, heading to the sidewalk outside Marathon Sports.\n\n\"I saw blood everywhere. I saw shock on people's faces. You couldn't tell who was alive and who was dead. People were lying all over the ground. ... It was chaos.\"\n\nThe blasts kept 5,600 people from crossing the finish line. Three people died, and 16 lost limbs. More than 250 others were scarred and maimed by hot metal shards, nails and pellets rocketing through the air.\n\nThe smell of gunpowder, burning hair and burning flesh was everywhere.\n\nThe officer rushed to a woman wearing a bright blue shirt. \"From the waist down, it's really tough to describe,\" he said, fighting his emotions. \"It was complete mutilation, that's as far as I can go.\"\n\nHe started giving her CPR.\n\nShe had a friend there calling out her name: Krystle Campbell. She was pale, and seemed to be in shock. She kept coughing.\n\n\"As I applied chest compressions, smoke was coming out of her mouth. She had to be in a lot of pain. I helped as best I could.\"\n\nCampbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager, was with one of her best friends, Karen Rand McWatters. They'd just finished posting smiling Facebook selfies when the bomb went off.\n\nMcWatters thought she was in a dream. \"My foot was turned sideways, so I knew something was really bad with my leg,\" she recalled. She dragged herself across the ground to Krystle.\n\n\"There was so much chaos and so much screaming, for some reason I got close to her head and we put our faces together. She very slowly said her legs hurt and we held hands. Very shortly after, her hand went limp and we never spoke again.\"\n\nRebekah Gregory noticed her 5-year-old son, Noah, was getting antsy, so she persuaded him to pretend he was a scientist collecting rocks on the sidewalk outside Marathon Sports. She remembers thinking she was surprised he bought it, and then she was knocked to the ground by the first blast.\n\n\"My first instinct as a mother was, 'Where in the world is my baby?' ''\n\nShe couldn't see her legs. \"My bones were literally lying next to me on the sidewalk.\"\n\nRebekah Gregory: I'm not scared anymore 04:39\n\nShe couldn't hear much, but she could hear Noah's voice, calling \"Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!\" She reached for him, vaguely aware of the burning sensation in her hand.\n\n\"When I lifted up my arm, all of my bones were sticking out through the flesh.\"\n\n\"This is going to be the day I die,\" she thought, lying back on the pavement. She said a little prayer: \"Alright, this is it. Take me, just take care of Noah.\"\n\nShe scanned the crowd for her son, and instead saw a woman she later learned was Krystle Campbell. It was obvious she was dead\n\nAlso in the heap of broken people in front of the sports store was Sydney Corcoran, a 17-year-old high school senior who was at the finish line with her parents to cheer for an aunt.\n\nShe remembers feeling sublimely happy just before the blast. So, when it happened, she didn't believe it was real at first. As she gathered her wits, she realized she was badly hurt; blood was gushing from her femoral artery.\n\n\"I felt cold. I was dying. The blood was leaving my body. I was bleeding out.\n\n\" 'This is it,\" she thought. \"I'm going to die. I'm not going to make it.\" She felt almost peaceful, like she was just going to sleep.\n\nBauman didn't get out of there. He didn't have time. He was still wondering about the somber man in black, the backpack he'd dropped on the ground when there was a flash, three pops and Bauman was knocked to the ground. He remembers looking up at the blue sky. The view was pleasant. Then he saw what had happened to him.\n\n\"I looked down and saw my legs, and it was just pure carnage. I could see my bones and the flesh sticking out, and I just went into tunnel vision. I thought, 'This is really messed up, this is messed up,' that's all I said in my head.\"\n\nHe thought he was a goner: \"This is how it's going to end. This is it. I had a great life. I saw the world. I played sports growing up. I had a lot of friends. ... I made peace with myself at that point.\"\n\nHe heard the second explosion and thought, again, \"This is messed up. We're under attack.\"\n\nA man wearing a cowboy hat rushed toward him with a wheelchair. Bauman, who lost both legs, was thrown into an ambulance and taken to a hospital. When he came to, he remembered the man in black with the 5 o'clock shadow and the backpack. He couldn't speak -- a tube was in his throat. So he wrote a note to a friend to tell the FBI.\n\nBy then, agents were busily collecting surveillance camera tapes. They wanted to know more about these two men, one wearing a black cap, the other, a white one.\n\nShane O'Hara, manager at Marathon Sports, was standing by the door when the blast shattered his window and sent dazed and bloody people running inside. Because he sells sneakers for a living, he said, \"I'm funny about feet.\"\n\nHe saw one woman's foot soaked in blood, and fashioned a tourniquet from athletic apparel. Later, he grabbed an armful of clothing, still on the hangers, and rushed outside to make more tourniquets to help save others.\n\nLike many first responders, O'Hara said the decisions he made that day still haunt him. They were difficult choices: Who do you try to help? Who is beyond saving?\n\n\"It was a scene like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Platoon,' \" he said.\n\nRoseann Sdoia was standing in front of the Forum restaurant with friends and, like everyone else, she swiveled her head to the left at the sound of the first explosion. \"I decided I should run, turned to my right and ran and saw two explosions of white light at my feet.\"\n\nShe knew before she hit the ground that she'd lost a leg. She remembers looking at \"a foot with a little sock on it\" next to her on the ground and wondering if it was hers.\n\nWhat shoes did I wear? Did I wear socks?\n\nShe decided the foot belonged to someone else.\n\nIt felt like she was wearing strappy sandals. Only later would she figure out that the \"straps\" were what was left of her foot.\n\n\"Somebody came over to me and told me I had to get out of here. I told them I couldn't get up. I don't have a leg.\"\n\nShe was sure she didn't want to live the rest of her life as an amputee. But then she thought about the alternative. She would miss her friends and family. She couldn't give up. She couldn't do that to them.\n\nShe willed herself to live, to fight until she got to the hospital. She kept her eyes shut because she is squeamish by nature. \"I'm not good with a paper cut, let alone what was going on out there that day.\"\n\nShe was loaded into a paddy wagon and taken to the hospital. She remembers being brought in on a gurney and \"the doors opening up.\"\n\n\"In my mind, I kept myself alive to that point, and after that, it was up to the doctors to save me.\"\n\nShe lost her leg above the knee. That was one of the awful lessons to come in the days ahead: An amputation below the knee was better, with a much quicker recovery. Above the knee meant you lost the joint, and the ability to swing and pivot. It is much harder to walk.\n\nShe still feels \"phantom pain\" from a limb that is no longer there.\n\n\"It seems at times I'm getting Tasered on my right foot, and there's no foot.\"\n\nOfficer Thomas Barrett, a 10-year veteran of the Boston Police Department, was standing across the street from the Forum, but he saw both blasts.\n\nWith the first, \"I could see white smoke, then a little black smoke and an orange flame,\" he said. \"The second one sounded much like the first, but a lot louder.\"\n\nHe saw an orange fireball, then white smoke, and then black smoke. He ran toward it.\n\n\"It smelled like sulfur, as if you were at the firing range, the heavy smell of gunpowder. I felt the heat. I'd liken it to opening up the oven, I could feel it right on my face.\"\n\nEven much later, he could feel heat radiating from the ground at the spot where the second bomb exploded.\n\nHe encountered dozens of people, some of them grievously injured. \"It was hard to choose where to begin, who to help first. I was just trying to pick who was hurt the worst.\"\n\nHe ran up to a man who was on fire, and patted at the flames.\n\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev during testimony of Officer Thomas Barrett, who picked up Leo, 3, after the bombing.\n\n\"As I was putting out the flames, somebody came up behind me and poured a beer or a drink on him to help me.\"\n\nSomeone yelled, \"There's a kid here,\" and he scooped up 3-year-old Leo, who was bleeding from a head injury. He carried the crying boy across the street and handed him off to other first responders, who placed him in an ambulance.\n\nHe used somebody's belt as a tourniquet for a man who had lost a leg.\n\n\"It was brutal There was a lot of blood on the ground mixed with what looked like charring. There was a person's leg that was on Boylston Street. I stepped on it. People were missing legs. The legs were ripped off, it wasn't anything clean or neat. A lot of people had clothes that were torn or shredded.\"\n\nHe saw a woman who was sitting up. \"She had been eviscerated across her abdomen,\" he recalled. \"She was holding on to her insides, she was holding them in.\"\n\nHe decided there was nothing he could do to help her.\n\nAnother officer, Lauren Wood, ran up to two woman, including the one clutching at her insides. She quickly saw her friend beside her was in much worse shape. She was vomiting profusely as an EMT tried to perform CPR.\n\nWood tried to clear the young woman's airway. \"I briefly saw that her lower torso had extensive injuries, particularly to her legs. I specifically saw blood, flesh, bone. There were people already working on her lower half so I stuck with what I knew, the CPR and clearing her airways.\"\n\nShe crouched on her shins, and noticed the vomit and debris in the young woman's hair. \"I would say her whole body was shaking, quivering. Her eyes kept rolling back and forth.\"\n\nThe other first responders decided she wasn't going to make it and moved on to help others. Wood tried to make eye contact, but the woman seemed shaky and confused, \"like she couldn't understand what was happening to her.\"\n\nShe looked into the young woman's handbag and learned who she was: Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old graduate student from China.\n\nShe kept talking to her.\n\n\"Lingzi, stay with us. You can do this. Stay strong.\"\n\nFirefighters helped her carry the woman to an ambulance, but they were told to take her out. It was too late. They needed the space for the ones they could save.\n\nWood covered the woman with a white sheet and stayed with her, even when she was told to leave the scene because there were fears of a third bomb. \"I wanted to take her with us, but the captain said no, she's part of the crime scene. You're still alive. You have to go.\"\n\nWood said she couldn't leave her. She thought about what would happen if another bomb took her face. She wanted Lu's parents to be able to see their daughter one last time.\n\nAlan Hern, a high school football coach from Martinez, California, was more worried about his wife than his kids. She was running the marathon even though she had just learned she was pregnant. Later, she told her husband that she thought about how happy she was as she neared the finish line.\n\n\"She turned the corner, thinking how thankful she was, how things were working out with her family, how things were going well with the baby. She was feeling good, and that's when the bombs went off.\"\n\nHern was knocked off his feet and disoriented. It felt as if everything was happening underwater. He took his daughter, Abigail, across the street, away from the carnage. She was unhurt but screaming hysterically.\n\nHe went back to look for his son, Aaron.\n\nParents seem to have some special radar that makes it easy to pick their child out of a crowd, even when that child is almost unrecognizable. Hern's eyes quickly found Aaron's; the boy's eyebrows had been singed by the blast.\n\n\"He had black soot all over his face and his hair was standing straight up, but I knew him right away.\" Aaron had a gaping hole in his leg. Hern eased him down onto the sidewalk, grabbed a belt and applied a tourniquet.\n\nHang in there, he told him.\n\n\"It really hurts, Dad. It really hurts.\"\n\nDoctors later found bone fragments from another person inside Aaron's leg wound. He had to undergo a powerful round of anti-HIV drugs, just in case.\n\nBut he was lucky in comparison to the boy who had been standing next to him. The blast didn't just take Martin Richard's leg. It blew his body apart.\n\nWilliam Richard knew his son wouldn't make it the moment he saw him. \"I just knew, from what I saw, there was no chance.\"\n\nHe left the 8-year-old on the sidewalk in front of the Forum restaurant. Martin was with his mother, who was blinded in one eye by shrapnel. Richard focused on his other two children. His 6-year-old daughter, Jane, had lost a leg and was in danger of bleeding to death.\n\nVictim's dad: 'I looked at Martin for the last time' 02:01\n\nHe struggled to scoop her up; a surveillance camera captured the scene. The video shown in court brought tears to the eyes of spectators and at least one juror. He walked across Boylston Street carrying Jane with his other son, Henry, clinging to him.\n\nAt the hospital, he learned Henry would be fine, but Jane faced a tougher battle.\n\n\"You know it's not going to be good when you see the look of horror on doctor's faces.\"\n\nJane's leg was amputated below the knee. She had at least 20 pieces of shrapnel throughout her body. As he identified her in photos and videos, Richard said more than once, \"That's Jane with two legs.\"\n\nAfterward, he left his wife and kids at the hospitals and went home and took a shower. He wanted to process what had happened to his family, and to wash away the sickening smell of gunpowder and burned flesh.\n\n\"I was injured but not as severely as so many other people,\" he said. He lost some of his hearing, and there's a permanent ringing in his ears.\n\n\"But I can still hear you, I can still hear music. I can still hear the beautiful voices of my family.\"",

    "text": "Academy voters surprised Oscar watchers Tuesday by opting for subtlety over flash in many nominee selections. USA TODAY looks at some of the intriguing decisions in top categories.\n\nPerhaps the biggest eye-opener was the number of best-picture nominees: nine out of a possible 10. While the exact number was up for grabs, many prognosticators expected seven or eight nominees.\n\nTwo films not expected to show up on the list were Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close and The Tree of Life.\n\nExtremely Loud, based on Jonathan Safran Foer's poignant book, is about a boy who lost his father in the Sept. 11 attacks. It stars Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock (and newcomer Thomas Horn) but got mixed reviews and was ignored in every other awards compilation. It did, however, benefit from a potent Oscar campaign.\n\nThe Tree of Life, director Terrence Malick's masterful but unconventional poetic meditation on life, memory and loss, divided viewers but apparently not academy voters. Both the film and director got nominations.\n\nLeft out of the equation was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2. The final installment in the hugely popular series was instead nominated for three technical awards: production design, set decoration and art direction.\n\nSteven Spielberg, who had a double chance of making it in, having directed both War Horse and The Adventures of Tintin, was surprisingly omitted from the mix. (War Horse, however, did make the best-picture list.)\n\nAs the humble immigrant gardener Carlos Galindo, Mexican-born Demi\u00e1n Bichir has garnered widespread critical praise in the little-seen A Better Life. Bichir beat out Leonardo DiCaprio, who was on most shortlists for his portrayal of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover in Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar, and Michael Fassbender, who played a man controlled by his compulsions in Shame. Ryan Gosling, who had two strong turns in Drive and Ides of March, was embraced by the Golden Globe voters but overlooked by the academy.\n\nAnother unexpected nomination was acclaimed British character actor Gary Oldman, who disappeared into the role of Smiley, a rumpled, bespectacled secret agent in the film adaptation of John le Carr\u00e9's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\n\nA couple of surprises also jumped out among the supporting-actor nominees. Swedish-born veteran Max von Sydow, who made a powerful impression in a wordless role in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, received a nomination, as did Nick Nolte for his role as a recovering alcoholic and shambling father in Warrior. But Albert Brooks was overlooked for his much-touted role as a Mob boss in Drive.\n\nRooney Mara was the only mild surprise for her title role in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Tilda Swinton had been expected to show up as a nominee for We Need to Talk About Kevin but was snubbed by Oscar voters.\n\nLeft out of the running for supporting actress was The Descendants' Shailene Woodley, who had a memorable role as George Clooney's feisty teenage daughter. Melissa McCarthy emerged as the surprise contender for her bawdy role in the raucous comedy Bridesmaids.\n\nTwo little-known movies were picked \u2014A Cat in Paris and Chico & Rita \u2014 but not Golden Globe winner The Adventures of Tintin, a big-budget effort employing performance-capture techniques that was helmed by Spielberg and Peter Jackson.",

    "text": "By Jeff DeLong, USA TODAY\n\nFor a second straight summer, a once-scenic mountain lake in\n\n\u2014 acquired by the federal government for $46 million in 2008 for public recreation \u2014 will remain drained and its future in limbo until a complex case over the final price tag is resolved in federal court.\n\nIncline Lake, on a ridge above Lake Tahoe near the California state line, was drained by its owners, the Incline Lake Corp., last year after a seismic safety study suggested its dam might fail during an earthquake, said Cheva Heck, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman.\n\nA one-time gathering spot for Nevada's rich and famous, the 720-acre parcel was transferred to the Forest Service with a $46 million payment to the Incline Lake Corp. Cabins around the lake were torn down and a private observatory relocated to Reno in 2008.\n\nA private parcel surrounded by the national forest, Incline Lake was inaccessible to the public for more than 70 years. Its public acquisition was long a government goal, and in 2004, its purchase was first proposed with proceeds raised through the sale of federal land near Las Vegas, Heck said.\n\nThe corporation and federal government are in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas to determine whether its sellers are owed more money through a \"friendly condemnation\" proceeding.\n\nThe corporation had sought as much as $75 million but could not reach agreement with federal appraisers, said Glen Williams, a representative of the former landowners.\n\nThe case had been before Judge Brian Sandoval in U.S. District Court in Reno, but Sandoval resigned his lifetime judicial appointment in September and won the Republican gubernatorial primary June 8.\n\nThe lake's future is being decided by U.S. District Judge James Mahan in Las Vegas. Resolution of the case is \"a ways off yet,\" Williams said.\n\nIf the matter goes to trial, it probably will not be until next spring, he said.\n\n\"It's a long, slow process,\" Williams said.\n\nSen. John Ensign, R-Nev., secured more than $5 million in federal funds to rebuild the dam, which would allow the lake to be refilled. But the Forest Service will not do so until the legal case is resolved, Heck said.\n\nThe lake could be refilled or some other plan could be implemented to manage the lake and surrounding land, Heck said.\n\nThe land could be restored as a natural wetlands containing much less water than a dammed lake.\n\n\"Nothing is off the table at this point,\" she said.\n\nScott Beenk, who regularly hikes and bikes in the area, described the drained lake as an eyesore.\n\n\"It should be restored to what it originally was. It's a shame it just sits there,\" said Beenk, 34.\n\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

    "text": "Describing the Bangkok driving experience, which seems to be equal parts gridlock and hail-Mary maneuvers at insane speeds, Sonchai explains: \u201cI should mention that there are two ways of avoiding death on our roads: pop pong and pop gun. Pop gun signifies the usual dreary ineffective stuff like wearing a seatbelt and not driving too fast; we generally prefer pop pong, with its inviolable spiritual protection. Done properly, pop pong not only protects your life, it can also deal out severe punishments to those who threaten it.\u201d\n\nMr. Burdett also offers drool-inducing descriptions of the local cuisine (this is the kind of book you can imagine Anthony Bourdain taking with him on one of his culinary globe trots for the Discovery Channel), riffs on Buddhism (which was \u201cnever designed to build caring communities or create social welfare programs\u201d) and primers on the sex-change trends among his countrymen: \u201cIn a nutshell, the ancient system, by which a Thai man has to worry about Everything while his Thai wife gets to live on a more hospitable planet at his expense, may be breaking down.\u201d\n\nOf course the vaunted state of wedded bliss doesn\u2019t often figure into Mr. Burdett\u2019s plot twists. It\u2019s true Sonchai is now married to Chanya, the main prostitute in \u201cBangkok Tattoo,\u201d a somewhat troubling development for the hero of a detective series, especially when a returning love interest turns him into an adulterer. But Mr. Burdett neatly sidesteps this potential character blemish through magical means.\n\nIs it technically adultery when the woman involved is a powerful, malevolent spirit who bends all men to her will? No, it\u2019s a win-win situation, in which readers get their dose of tortured, it-can\u2019t-end-well-for-them sex scenes, and Sonchai gets to come out smelling like a rose.\n\nBut even if we have to deal with the now-wholesome Chanya (pregnant, no less) until Mr. Burdett can figure out how to fix that narrative faux pas and render his hero footloose again, there are plenty of unreformed characters to distract.\n\nThere\u2019s Sonchai\u2019s mother, for example, a retired prostitute now running the Old Man\u2019s Club. Another bright spot is Yammy, a Japanese artiste whiling away his time shooting highbrow skin flicks until he can work his way deep enough into the drug trade to secure financing for a real art-house film. As he writes in one of his increasingly desperate text messages to Sonchai: \u201cI\u2019ve found a mule so I won\u2019t have to carry myself. Please talk to the Colonel. I don\u2019t think I can take much more of this. I must practice my art.\u201d\n\nBut my deepest affections are reserved for Vikorn, with his larcenous schemes and his smirks \u201cof undiluted triumphalism,\u201d and Lek, the transsexual in process. Even though \u201cthe more he takes of the estrogen, the less defense he possesses against idle flattery,\u201d Lek remains a dedicated assistant. Sauntering up to his boss\u2019s desk one afternoon, he \u201chas something of the weary professional about him,\u201d despite long hair, a hint of rouge on his cheeks and a \u201cyaa dum aromatherapy inhaler\u201d stuck in one nostril.\n\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019ve been chasing leads all day,\u2019 he explains, switching nostrils, \u2018and it\u2019s hot and stinky.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere are fine points to be quibbled over if one wants to be a bore but, really, what more can you ask from summer reading than passages such as this? \u201cBangkok Haunts\u201d is a book to be gobbled up at top speed, preferably while wearing sunglasses and drinking through a twisty straw.

    "text": "Every year a new reality emerges at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and 2016 was no exception. It was a particularly banner year for the future of mobility. Electric vehicles went mass market. Rear-view mirrors became obsolete. And self-driving cars took another big step toward the here and now. In fact, there were more new transportation concepts and innovative automotive technologies on display than ever before. Here are but a few of the most notable.\n\n2017 Chevrolet Bolt EVCapable and affordable, the handsome Bolt is an electric car for the masses, says Chevrolet. Compared with the Nissan Leaf, the Bolt EV rolls twice as far (200 miles) on a charge, offers more interior space and packs more tech for approximately the same price (about $30,000 in the US, after a $7,500 Federal tax credit). We\u2019ll see how it compares with Tesla\u2019s Model 3, which is scheduled to be unveiled this spring. Until then, the Bolt sets a new benchmark for EVs.\n\nFaraday Future FFZERO1While the Bolt is the practical man\u2019s electric vehicle, the FFZERO1 is for the extremist. This slick-looking single-seat racer was put together in only three months by FF's Head of Design Richard Kim and his team to serve as an example of what can built atop the fledgling automaker\u2019s all-new scalable vehicle architecture. Though Kim says the FFZERO1 will not be Faraday\u2019s first production car, he does admit that its sci-fi features \u201chint at the look of coming production models.\"\n\nVolkswagen BUDD-e ConceptHippies rejoice: VW has electrified your beloved Microbus and, in the process, provided the rest of us with a glimpse into the future of the manufacturer's electrification program. Though Volkswagen didn't say much about the BUDD-e\u2019s propulsion system, it will be configured like the Tesla Model S, with electric motors at the front and rear axles and a battery pack in between. The range on a full charge is 233 miles and top speed is a swift 93mph. While the Microbus physique was meant to pull on the heartstrings of tech-impaired empty nesters, the BUDD-e boasts the latest bells and whistles. For example, all systems can be controlled through touchscreens, voice commands or gestures, from turning on the heat to opening the side doors.\n\nKia Drive Wise Autonomous CarsKia jumped into the driverless-car fray by unveiling its new line of Drive Wise autonomous driving technologies. The systems, which include urban and highway modes, use a combination of radar, camera, GPS and ultrasonic sensors to negotiate lane-changing and overtaking on highways or to navigate busy city environments without input from the driver. Also on display was the I-Cockpit concept, which previewed the automaker\u2019s next-generation human-machine interface technologies, including gesture control and a touchpad that automatically recognizes driver preferences based on a fingerprint swipe. Kia hopes to bring partially autonomous vehicles to market by 2020 and completely driver-less cars by 2030.\n\nEHang 184 Personal Driving VehicleThe real must-have gadget from CES, the EHang 184 is part drone, part personal helicopter. This car-sized electric quadcopter can carry a single occupant up to 10 miles with almost no guidance. The passenger inputs the destination via a mobile app, and the 184 autonomously handles the rest. According to the company, it can fly for about 23 minutes on a full charge, at speeds up to 62mph. Sadly, it's not legal in the US.\n\nBMW AirTouch 3DThe human-machine interface was a hot topic in Sin City this year, as many automakers and automotive systems suppliers showed off gesture-control and eye-tracking technologies designed to reduce driver distraction. BMW's second-generation gesture control system, AirTouch 3D, in the iVision Future Interaction concept car, was one of the more impressive technologies being developed. With it, you can control the car's in-dash screen just like a touchscreen without ever actually touching it.\n\nBMW Motorrad Vision Head-Up Display\n\nAlthough BMW's four-wheeled innovations took centre stage at CES, the company's motorcycle division had some clever kit at the show, as well, including a helmet with a built-in heads-up display. Similar to the Skully AR-1, BMW's Vision helmet places a transparent display over the rider's right eye, onto which is projected a host of basic data, including speed, fuel level, navigation and road-hazard alerts. The display can also serve as a closed-circuit rear-view feed, eliminating the need to glance at the side mirror. The company says the helmet should be production ready within a few years.\n\nWith Amazon connection, Ford's Sync comes homeAnother emerging trend at this year\u2019s CES involved enhancing the communication between your car and home. One of the more accessible solutions is the result of a collaboration between Ford and Amazon. It involves linking Ford\u2019s Sync infotainment system with the online retail giant's Echo smart home hub. Using voice commands, Sync users can, say, open a garage door, access their home\u2019s thermostat or turn on an outside light from miles away. Vice versa, through Amazon's Alexa digital assistant, users will be able to stop, start, lock, unlock and check their vehicle's fuel range from the comfort of home.\n\nGracenote Dynamic EQGood sound quality is sorely underrated. And Gracenote knows it. That\u2019s why the company has created a new layer of technology, an algorithm, to analyze every song you play, and then automatically adjust your car stereo's equalizer settings to optimize the aural quality of the playback. By customizing EQ settings down to the track level every song sounds like the artist meant it to be heard.\n\nSelf-driving Mercedes E-ClassNo, Mercedes-Benz did not unveil an autonomous E-Class. But it did announce that the next-gen E, which is scheduled to be unveiled this week at the Detroit Auto Show, is now licensed to drive itself on roads in Nevada. Expected to go on sale later this year as a 2017 model, the all-new E is rumored to feature one of the most comprehensive autonomous feature sets of any production vehicle. it is the first production car to be granted one of these Nevada licenses.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this or anything else you have seen on BBC Autos, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

    "text": "How do you walk a line that keeps disintegrating beneath you? The characters in \u201cSkeleton Crew,\u201d the very fine new play by Dominique Morisseau that opened on Tuesday night at the Atlantic Stage 2, travel an uncertain path between comfort and chaos, lawfulness and criminality, mutual support and blinkered selfishness.\n\nYou might add to the list that most traditional of opposites, the good and the bad. Then again, are ethics affordable luxuries when your overriding concern is to avoid joining the homeless? What are your obligations to anybody else when it\u2019s all you can do to keep yourself from sliding over the edge?\n\nSuch questions are being constantly weighed, discarded and picked up once more in this warm-blooded, astute and beautifully acted four-character drama, the third installment in Ms. Morisseau\u2019s trilogy of plays set in Detroit. I suppose you could say these are questions that to some degree haunt everybody in those Darwinian jungles where we fight for our paychecks.\n\nBut the time and place of \u201cSkeleton Crew,\u201d directed with a slow hand and a quick pulse by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, gives these issues a mortal urgency. It is 2008, the height of the Great Recession (whose repercussions on a very different level are depicted in the film \u201cThe Big Short\u201d), and we are in hard-hit Detroit, in an automobile stamping factory described as \u201cthe last small plant standing.\u201d Needless to say, it\u2019s standing on shaky ground.\n\nAn awareness of the tenuousness of their jobs makes the factory\u2019s employees painfully conscious that, as the no-nonsense Faye (Lynda Gravatt), puts it, \u201cAny moment one of us could be the other.\u201d She goes on: \u201cOne minute you passin\u2019 the woman on the freeway holdin\u2019 up the \u2018will work for food\u2019 sign. Next minute, you sleepin\u2019 in your car.\u201d Faye\u2019s dogged insistence that she will always be a survivor makes you just a little apprehensive for her.\n\nLike Ms. Morisseau\u2019s \u201cSunset Baby\u201d \u2014 a portrait of the drug-dealing daughter of a black revolutionary, seen in New York in 2013 in a Labyrinth Theater Company production \u2014 \u201cSkeleton Crew\u201d is about what happens to people for whom survival becomes the foremost (if not the only) goal in life. It is, in many ways, an old-fashioned play: naturalistic, tightly structured and filled with self-defining monologues of vernacular lyricism.\n\nClifford Odets\u2019s dramas of an oppressed and restless working class come to mind. So inevitably does the great Pittsburgh cycle of August Wilson, which Ms. Morisseau cites as an abiding influence.\n\nBut \u201cSkeleton Crew\u201d is also squarely in the tradition of Arthur Miller\u2019s probing studies of consciences under siege and the crippling concessions made in the name of success. It is, in other words, a deeply moral and deeply American play, with a loving compassion for those trapped in a system that makes sins, spiritual or societal, and self-betrayal almost inevitable.\n\nMs. Morisseau works her big themes on a small, closely patterned canvas. The action takes place entirely in an auto factory\u2019s break room (designed with long-lived-in shabbiness by Michael Carnahan, with mortuary lighting by Rui Rita), where three co-workers punch in, play cards, snack and trade ominous water-cooler gossip.\n\nThey are the aforementioned Faye, their union representative who\u2019s been on the assembly line for 29 years; the combustible Dez (Jason Dirden), who has ambitions for a life beyond the factory; and Shanita (Nikiya Mathis), a visibly pregnant single mother to be, and a second-generation line worker.\n\nThen there\u2019s the guy who made good, Reggie (Wendell B. Franklin), their foreman, caught between obligations to workers and management. There\u2019s a chip on his shoulder, but even he doesn\u2019t know which way it leans. Faye is an old family friend, and in confiding to her that the plant will be shutting down, Reggie puts her in a similarly uneasy position.\n\nAdd to this a teasing sexual chemistry between Dez and Shanita, and rumors that someone is stealing parts from the plant, which is downsizing all along, and you have a tidy setup for conflicts. And, oh, yes, we learn early that someone is packing a gun.\n\nBut this production gently confounds expectations. It\u2019s not that what happens is unforeseeable; every revelation (with one late-arriving exception) makes perfect sense. What surprises is how the script always stops short of melodrama.\n\nMs. Morisseau is less interested in igniting the sensationalism for which her plot would seem to be wired than in rendering lives that, even in crisis, retain their quotidian flow, because life, after all, has a way of going on. And as written, directed and performed, each character exists fluidly and comprehensibly within that stream.\n\nThe well-tuned ensemble guarantees that these characters never slip into stereotype. Ms. Gravatt\u2019s fully embodied Faye would at first appear to be the classic, bluff and gruff truth teller. But as we learn more about her past \u2014 and present \u2014 we see the kinks and chinks within the hearty presence. She becomes less adorable and infinitely more likable.\n\nMr. Franklin does a skillful slow burn as a perplexed, honorable man who would surely do the right thing if he could figure out what it was. As Dez, the compelling Mr. Dirden is prickly, randy, dangerous and a born gentleman. And he and Ms. Mathis, who endows her character with a sensual spontaneity that keeps undercutting her justifiable wariness, render Dez and Shanita\u2019s hesitant courtship as a poignant melding of affinity and necessity.\n\nResonant images recur and echo through \u201cSkeleton Crew\u201d \u2014 cars that break down but also save lives; crumbling ghost factories; lungs and the rhythms of breathing. But they are conceits that grow organically out of how these characters see and speak.\n\nThe only element in the show that seems slightly out of sync is the bridging of scenes with dances by Adesola Osakalumi, solo performances that suggest the ritualization and dehumanization of assembly line work. They\u2019re expertly rendered (and fun to watch). But they contradict how Ms. Morisseau\u2019s characters see what they do.\n\nThese people are good at their jobs, which are demeaning only because of the ignorance in which management keeps its employees. For Shanita, the most comforting music in the world is factory noise. That sound, she says, \u201cfills up the silence like it ain\u2019t never gonna disappear on you or let you go.\u201d\n\nCategory Off Broadway, Drama, Play\n\nCredits Written by Dominique Morisseau; Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson\n\nCast Starring Jason Dirden, Wendell B. Franklin, Lynda Gravatt, Nikiya Mathis and Adesola Osakalumi\n\nClosing Date February 14, 2016",

The massive spending bill introduced last night \u2014 the \"Cromnibus\" as Washington has christened it \u2014 includes a provision to extend a moratorium on taxes for Internet sales and services.\n\nThat would ban states from imposing taxes on access to the Internet through October 2015. There's a push to get that ban extended indefinitely \u2014 led by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who has 52 co-sponsors for the measure. The ban was first passed to get people to use the Internet. But its extension has been tied up in the debate over whether the U.S. should compel online businesses to collect state sales taxes.\n\nThe two issues are different but not separate, thanks to legislation that would have made the access tax moratorium permanent while also pushing forward sales taxes. The debate over online sales taxes, however, is also headed nowhere fast. A bill to require sales tax collection online essentially died last month due to opposition from Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) \u2014 a known critic of a federal law mandating online sales taxes. Right now, taxpayers are supposed to declare the tax they owe on online purchases themselves. You may be surprised to hear this doesn't happen that often.\n\nBoth issues are likely to be key ones for the tech policy crowd come 2015, but there shouldn't be any Congressional movement on either in the near term.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Wyden said that he's definitely going to keep the access tax issue in the spotlight. \u201cBy extending this bill, the Congress has, for the short term, ensured that this longstanding policy keeps Internet access tax-free,\" he said. \"I\u2019m going to continue fighting to ensure that these protections will bolster the digital economy for the long term.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect that Congress has yet to pass the spending bill.\n\nHayley Tsukayama covers consumer technology for The Washington Post.",

When we had the lead, we let people down,\u201d Mr. Romney told a crowd in this important swing state. \u201cWe need to make sure\u201d they are not let down again. \u201cI will cut the deficit and get us on track to a balanced budget.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Romney regularly promises to whip the budget into shape, he rarely says that his fellow Republicans have fallen short.\n\nIn a call for unity, the Republican presidential candidate said he would work to bring both sides of the aisle together if he wins the presidency.\n\n\u201cThis is a time for us to come together as a nation,\u201d Mr. Romney said. \u201cWe do not have to have the kind of divisiveness and bitterness and recriminations we\u2019ve seen over the last four years.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly the tune his fellow Republicans were singing Saturday.\n\nWhen House Speak John Boehner (R., Ohio) introduced Mr. Romney, he served up some fiery criticism for his Democratic counterparts in Congress.\n\n\u201cWe have focused on the economy and jobs every single day,\u201d said Mr. Boehner. \u201cAnd, you know, while we\u2019ve done all this good work in the House and done what the people have asked us to do, Harry Reid has blocked everything we\u2019ve sent over there,\u201d he said, referring to the Democratic Senate majority leader.\n\nAmid a partisan standoff in Washington over taxation and budget-cutting, Congress has become a highly unpopular institution. Just 12% of registered voters said they approved of the job Congress was doing in an August Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Some 82% said they disapproved.\n\nFor Mr. Romney, that makes for the need to strike a delicate balance on the trail. He talks up bipartisanship, but his own running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, has been bogged down in the caustic congressional fights of the past few years. His fellow Republicans, meanwhile, regularly rail against Democrats in an effort to keep hold of the House and upend Democratic control of the Senate.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Romney kept his sights trained on President Barack Obama\u2014and the opening of the college football season.\n\n\u201cOne of the promises he made was he was going to create more jobs, and today 23 million people are out of work or stopped looking for work,\u201d or are underemployed, Mr. Romney said of the president. \u201cLet me tell you, if you have a coach that\u2019s zero and 23 million, you say it\u2019s time to get a new coach.

    "text": "PARIS \u2014 \u201cUh, where\u2019s the grunt?\u201d Chris Evert asked on the eve of the women\u2019s final at the French Open.\n\nEvert, a seven-time champion at Roland Garros, was simultaneously watching two screens on Friday in the NBC television compound.\n\nOn one screen was footage of Maria Sharapova\u2019s full-throated, three-set victory over Eugenie Bouchard in Thursday\u2019s semifinal.\n\nOn the other was footage of a much more muted Sharapova playing in the quarterfinals of the 2004 French Open, when she won just four games against the Argentine veteran Paola Su\u00e1rez.\n\nTen years ago in Paris, Sharapova was only a few weeks from becoming a global star by upsetting Serena Williams to win Wimbledon at 17. But at Roland Garros, she was still a rising teenager with a relatively low profile who was searching for her game and footing on clay and who played her drizzly day match against Su\u00e1rez on a show court that was not even half full.\n\nThese were what Sharapova would later call her days of being a \u201ccow on ice.\u201d But to watch her long before she became a French Open champion, the phrase \u201cfawn on ice\u201d seems closer to the mark.\n\nIn 2004, she was slight to the point of being spindly, and instead of sliding into her shots like a true clay courter, she would take a couple of abrupt, often imprecise steps after contact in an urgent attempt to change direction.\n\n\u201cShe dictates the middle of the court a lot better now and she moves in aggressively, and it seems like she was a little more passive 10 years ago,\u201d Evert said. \u201cBut the biggest difference I see in her moving is her recovery \u2014 recovering from wide shots and getting back into the court.\u201d\n\nThe point of the double-screen approach was to appreciate just how far Sharapova had traveled on her dusty road to being a perennial French Open contender. After reaching two semifinals, she won the title in 2012 and then lost in the final last year to Williams, her longtime tormentor.\n\nThis year, she will be the favorite on Saturday against Simona Halep, a subtle Romanian talent who is seeded higher (4) than Sharapova (7) but who will be playing in her first Grand Slam singles final.\n\nSharapova has won each of the Grand Slam titles once, and if she capitalizes on her much greater experience and prevails against Halep, she will have won more major trophies in Paris than anywhere else. That would be some career twist for a woman who grew up largely on American hardcourts and who has never been the game\u2019s smoothest mover.\n\nSharapova\u2019s career record on clay is 131-24, and 10 of her past 12 victories over top-five players have come on the surface, which is perhaps her best.\n\n\u201cThat she is in this position just shows her determination, her determination to set that goal for herself,\u201d Evert said. \u201cIt also shows that power is still winning. Power still reigns over finesse.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, remains to be reconfirmed Saturday. Halep, who has lost her three previous matches to Sharapova, is more about finesse than power, even if she can still produce plenty of pop with her fluid, technically sound ground strokes.\n\nEvert, 40 years after her first French Open victory, in 1974, is scheduled to award the trophies and expects to be handing the bigger one to Sharapova \u2014 even if she thinks Sharapova was playing better and more confident tennis a year ago in Paris.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s going to come out and overpower Halep, who, if she\u2019s human, will be a little overwhelmed by being in the final, which is natural,\u201d Evert said. \u201cBut I could be wrong.\u201d\n\nA victory for Sharapova would also be a full-circle moment for a women who missed the United States Open and the end of last season with her latest round of serious right shoulder problems.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud because I worked hard to get myself injury-free,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cI had to work through some tough losses in the beginning of the season that I didn\u2019t want to accept. I worked through them. I worked hard, and I\u2019m in this position, giving myself a chance.\u201d\n\nSharapova tore her right rotator cuff in two places in 2008 and missed nearly a year of competition. Her serve has not been as consistent since her return, particularly her second serve, and the difference between her motion in 2004 and now is striking.\n\n\u201cHer serve was much more fluid, much more of an easy, natural motion,\u201d Evert said as she watched the footage on both screens. \u201cI just think she has so many hitches now. She kept her elbow higher in the take-back in 2004, and she was reaching for it and snapping the ball at the top, getting good snap.\u201d\n\nPaul Annacone, who coached Pete Sampras and Roger Federer, passed by the room, greeted Evert and took a look of his own.\n\n\u201cMaria\u2019s serve is a lot more manufactured now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was long and smooth and fine in 2004. I actually think her motion now looks more likely to cause a shoulder problem because it\u2019s a little more rigid. She also has a bit of a lag in her take-back and doesn\u2019t go all the way up to the back-scratch position. She kind of stops halfway, which I don\u2019t think is great for your shoulder, or rotator cuff, either.\u201d\n\nBut what is clearly smoother and improved is Sharapova\u2019s court coverage on the crushed red brick that passes for clay in Paris. Instead of a fawn on ice, she is a woman in her element: sliding laterally and expertly into open-stance forehands and backhands; sliding forward in pursuit of the drop shots that Bouchard rightly deployed to bring her out of her comfort zone and to the net.\n\nSharapova, at 27, looks stronger in the legs; stronger in the core; much harder to knock off balance and off rhythm and also much easier to hear as the occasional grunts through clenched teeth of that 2004 quarterfinal have, depending on one\u2019s tastes and perspective, evolved or devolved into today\u2019s soundtrack of extended, open-mouthed shrieks.\n\n\u201cI think that helps her nerves when she lets it out,\u201d Evert said. \u201cShe\u2019s thinking about that rather than the nerves.\u201d\n\nBut Sharapova, who has needed to rally to win her past three matches in three sets, has often cranked up the volume loudest just after match point in Paris this year.\n\nDespite all the titles won and millions of dollars earned, Sharapova looks and sounds even hungrier than she was in 2004.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re wired differently,\u201d Evert said of enduring tennis champions. \u201cI can relate to Maria in that aspect. It\u2019s hard to let it go.\n\n\u201cI remember when I got married to Andy,\u201d Evert said of her second husband, the alpine skier Andy Mill. \u201cHe\u2019d had 11 surgeries on his knees, and I remember him saying: \u2018Chrissie, milk it as long as you can. It\u2019s going to be over before you know it. You have the whole rest of your life, but right now, you are great at something.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo the desire was there, and the desire is there for her, too,\u201d Evert said of Sharapova.",

Stewart Ellis of the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre says a series of balancing acts is necessary.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s management of the land. The more small fires are prevented, the more undergrowth can flourish \u2013 providing \"fuel\" for when a giant fire arrives. So, not every wildfire should be put out and controlled precautionary burning can also be a very good thing.\n\nThen there\u2019s the psychology of people at risk: how to prepare them, how to warn them and how much to scare them has been studied.\n\nIf authorities cry wolf too many times, people won't react to a warning when it\u2019s really needed. But effective messaging when danger really is imminent is essential and authorities can now automatically phone warnings to every mobile or landline in a set geographic area.\n\nEqually, people need to be prepared. Big media campaigns encourage people to have \"bushfire survival plans\" worked out well in advance. People need to be worried enough to take that task seriously. When disaster hits, studies suggest prepared people are calmer people and make better decisions. Having worries in advance mitigates against panic at the last moment.\n\nEllis says encouraging people to leave their homes early in the face of a fire, rather than suggesting they defend their homes, is crucial.\n\n\u201cA greater emphasis on leaving is needed. If you\u2019re not there [when the fire is] you will survive. If you stay, all bets are off,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nBut he says people often make irrational decisions.\n\n\u201cThe emotional pull of pets is huge and can [have] a direct influence on people\u2019s safety. If we open a refuge but say \u2018no animals\u2019, that\u2019s far less successful in getting them in.\"\n\nAt the same time, the science of how bushfires work improves all the time: computer modelling takes into account topography and how different vegetation types will burn.\n\nThe latest fires in the state of South Australia didn\u2019t kill anyone. That's a success those fighting Australia\u2019s bushfires \u2013 literally or, through their academic work \u2013 want to replicate.",

Global trade imbalances between the U.S. and the rest of the world have built up massive reserves overseas and public and private debt here at home.\n\nWider and deeper financial markets around the world--with additional fuel from China's and Japan's exchange-rate policies, sovereign wealth funds, highly leveraged hedge funds and other new players--made for cheap credit. These circumstances also provided the vectors to send \"tainted\" financial products to Germany, England and other countries far from our domestic housing market. In short, this is a housing-market bubble unlike any in U.S. history; it has global roots and global aftershocks.\n\nAs they face continued uncertainty, lenders remain cautious. To restore their confidence, we need to be transparent about these new financial players and instruments, from sovereign wealth funds to exotic investments.\n\nThe global markets will welcome a clear statement from the G-8 that a new, higher standard of financial transparency--and, moreover, accountability--is a shared priority of advanced economies, even if it isn't for the firms that profited from obscuring risk.\n\nIn another departure from historical precedent, a rapid jump in global food and fuel prices has come just as the U.S. economy is slowing down. This time, pressure is coming from developing nations, where investment and consumption are now approaching self-sustaining levels.\n\nThese actions are increasingly decoupled from our domestic financial weakness, but we are not decoupled from the global commodity markets they are driving. Because they hit families directly, spiking fuel and food prices are the most visible evidence of tight global markets in all commodities.\n\nOil prices have more than doubled in the last year, causing economic and political disruption. Inevitably, energy demand in the developing world will keep expanding. And since there's no room in our atmosphere for more carbon emissions, only a climate deal can create a global market for alternative energy.\n\nEnergy and climate, of course, are at the top of the G-8's agenda. We need a statement of shared commitment by these nations to reduce emissions 50% by 2050--a level that scientific research tells us will avert climate disaster--and to agree to negotiate the gradual targets that will get us there.\n\nOur leadership is needed to seal a global deal that will signal to the markets that the time has come for alternative energy sources and stimulate investment and job creation in new technologies.\n\nFood, however, presents a different challenge. Growing demand worldwide for better and healthier diets should be a success story; with improved food supply and distribution, it can be. The international community must address the food crisis in a coordinated, strategic manner.\n\nAfrica will once again be a focus of this year's meeting, but the need is global. Right now, donors must keep the promises of financial assistance to Africa that they announced at the 2005 summitt in the U.K. The U.S. is on track to meets its pledge by 2010, but the same is not true for other members of the G-8. And in the long term, we need another green revolution to bring the agricultural productivity of advanced economies to the rest of the world.\n\nWe should not expect miracles from this year's G-8 summit. But we should count on leaders to issue clear statements of common purpose that confront the world's shared challenges.\n\nSen. Joseph R. Biden (D-Del.) is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",

    "text": "The UN has confirmed that the worst chemical weapons attack in 25 years took place in eastern Damascus last month, involving specially designed rockets that spread sarin nerve agent over rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital.\n\nThe report did not assign blame for the attack but the US, Britain and France said the details on the sarin, the rockets used and their trajectories all proved that Bashar al-Assad's regime was responsible.\n\nHowever, Russia argued that the western powers had \"jumped to conclusions\" and said claims of rebel use against their own supporters to provoke foreign intervention \"should not be shrugged off\".\n\nThere was also sharp disagreement about what kind of UN resolution was needed to implement the agreement struck by the US and Russia on Saturday in Geneva on dismantling the Assad regime's chemical weapons programme.\n\nThe differences \u2013 on whether an initial resolution should include the threat of punitive measures for Syrian non-compliance \u2013 were a reminder that the Geneva agreement could still unravel before it is put into force.\n\nPresenting the report, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said: \"This is the most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988. The international community has pledged to prevent any such horror from recurring, yet it has happened again.\"\n\nHowever, Ban did not say who was responsible for the attack, noting that was not in the mandate of the UN investigation.\n\n\"It is for others to pursue this matter further to determine responsibility. We will all have our own thoughts on this,\" the secretary general said.\n\nPresenting their arguments afterwards, western diplomats said the head of the UN investigation team, \u00c5ke Sellstr\u00f6m, a Swedish scientist, had observed that the quality of the sarin used in the attack on western and eastern Ghouta suburbs on 21 August was higher than that used in the 1995 terror attack on the Tokyo underground or Saddam Hussein's attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja.\n\nSellstr\u00f6m also said the rockets used were professionally made. His report said they were fired from the north-west, and western officials said the details of the trajectories confirmed that they came from an area held by government troops.\n\n\"All of that confirms in our view there is no remaining doubt that it was the regime that used the chemical weapons. It confirms that the regime was responsible,\" Mark Lyall Grant, the British envoy to the UN, said.\n\nHis American counterpart, Samantha Power, singled out evidence in the UN report on the calibre of rocket used, saying that in \"thousands of videos\" from the Syrian conflict there was no indication that the rebels had such weapons. Nor was there any evidence that the rebels possessed sarin, she added.\n\n\"The technical details of the report make clear that only the regime could have carried out this chemical weapons attack,\" Power said. The French ambassador, Gerard Araud, echoed her conclusions.\n\nHowever, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, complained: \"Some colleagues jumped to conclusions when they said the attack was by government forces. We have not even had a chance to look at the report. We have just had a quick glance. The allegations that it was the opposition cannot be simply shrugged off.\"\n\nThe Sellstr\u00f6m report noted the kind of rockets used and pointed out that they had been fired from the north-west in the early hours when the air was moving downwards, maximising casualties.\n\n\"Chemical weapons use in such meteorological conditions maximises their potential impact as the heavy gas can stay close to the ground and penetrate into lower levels of buildings and constructions where many people were seeking shelter,\" it said.\n\nThe report said that one of the rockets analysed was an M14 rocket, which had been fired by a multiple rocket launcher. The second was a 330mm rocket.\n\nPeter Bouckaert, a weapons specialist at Human Rights Watch, said: \"The rocket systems identified by the UN as used in the attack \u2013 truck-launched 330mm rockets with around 50 to 60 litres of sarin, as well as 140mm Soviet-produced rockets carrying a smaller sarin-filled warhead \u2013 are both known to be in the arsenal of the Syrian armed forces. They have never been seen in rebel hands.\"\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is expected to meet in the coming days to endorse the Geneva agreement on the disarming of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile.",

I contacted my Internet provider and they said it is out of their control.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the Islamic republic has announced \"a permanent suspension of Google's e-mail services,\" and that a national e-mail service would soon be available. The newspaper's journalist who reported the story said the announcement was first reported on the Web site of the Iranian Labour News Agency -- aligned with former President Mohammad Hashemi Rafsanjani, a reformist -- but the material has since been pulled off the site.\n\nAn Iranian tech site -- IT-Iran.com -- on Wednesday published the ILNA story, in which the chief operating officer at the government's information technology company said suspending Gmail \"should be seen as an opportunity to guide the nations towards a national based e-mail system. Until we stop putting our trust in foreigners, we will not witness domestic technological progress, which means that we must trust the administration and the system.\"\n\n\"We have heard from users in Iran that they are having trouble accessing Gmail,\" Google said in a statement to CNN. \"We can confirm a sharp drop in traffic and we have looked at our own networks and found that they are working properly.\n\n\"Whenever we encounter blocks in our services we try to resolve them as quickly as possibly because we strongly believe that people everywhere should have the ability to communicate freely online. Sadly, sometimes it is not within our control.\"\n\nWhile Iranians have reported Gmail services being down for several days, it appeared that Yahoo and other e-mail services were still working late Wednesday. Accustomed to such blocks, Iranians have become savvy about alternative links allowing them to get around government filters so they can communicate via e-mail.\n\nMore ominously, human rights groups and opposition Web sites have reported widespread arrests targeting journalists.\n\nAccording to the Paris-based journalism watchdog Reporters Without Borders, at least eight journalists were arrested Sunday and Monday, bringing the total number of reporters now in prison to at least 65.\n\n\"They have arrested everybody,\" said Nooshabeh Amiri, a journalist who fled Iran five years ago and now writes for the Persian Web site Rooz online from exile in Paris. Amiri said some of her former colleagues are trying to flee Iran.\n\n\"Just this morning I helped somebody leave through Iraq,\" she said.\n\nThere were also reports that journalist trying to enter Iran this week have been denied visas by the government. CNN had requested a visa for a correspondent to cover the anniversary events in Iran and that application was denied.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian security officers have put out a steady drumbeat of warnings, announcing they will not tolerate opposition protesters during state-sponsored celebrations Thursday, the 31st anniversary of the foundation of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\n\"People's massive participation in 22 Bahman (February 11) rallies will thwart the plots hatched by the enemies to disturb the national ceremony, and enemies will have no opportunity for maneuvering and presenting themselves,\" Police Chief Brig. Gen. Ahmadi Moqaddam said, according to the state-backed Fars News Agency.\n\nOn January 28, authorities executed two opposition activists after convicting them of being \"mohareb,\" or enemies of God.\n\nOn Tuesday, a court sentenced another activist to death. At least 10 opposition members now await execution.\n\n\"Our phones are strictly followed and controlled,\" said one young Iranian who participated in past protests, during a phone conversation from Tehran.

She takes readers to Maine, where she owns a vacation home, in the August issue, on newsstands through Aug. 16. She shares her travel highlights and tips with USA TODAY.\n\nQ: Where have you been recently that you liked or were surprised by?\n\nA: I recently visited the district in France near Moustiers where the lavender is grown for the perfume industry. It is extraordinarily beautiful, rustic, educational\u2014and fragrant! I've always wanted to see the purple fields. We took a helicopter there, which made the trip even more visual. It's my favorite way to travel when sightseeing. You can cover a lot of ground and you are able to stop for lunch at La Bastide de Moustiers, Alain Ducasse's country inn in Moustiers.\n\nQ: What's the best place you've ever visited?\n\nA: I have been to many special places all over the world. The Galapagos Islands, parts of China, Northern Sikkim, the top of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Valley of the Kings in Egypt are among the most inspiring places I've visited. But my breath is still taken away by the glorious ocean view from the terrace at my home on Mount Desert Island in Maine. From here you can see the various islands that surround Maine's largest island.\n\nQ: What's the most surprising/unexpected place you're ever visited?\n\nA: The Alaskan Glaciers \u2014 they are actually a deep, azure blue and walking on them is eerily exciting. It was amazing to be tromping around on ice glaciers that are thousands of feet thick. They have giant crevasses and are constantly cracking, so you have to have a guide.\n\nQ: What's your favorite vacation spot?\n\nA: Maine is most certainly my favorite vacation spot. It has so much to offer: the woods, the mountains and the sea. I really enjoy Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, Maine. It offers such a plethora of plants, rock formations and beautiful views. I also love to hike The Ladder Trail. It's one of the oldest trails in Acadia.\n\nQ: Can you offer an insider tip or recommendation for your favorite vacation place?\n\nA: I am an avid hiker and Maine has some of the most phenomenal trails I've ever hiked, many of which offer truly magnificent vistas of the sea. In the August issue of Martha Stewart Living, I've included some great hiking tips as well as a guide to some of the best hikes and campsites in the area.\n\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

    "text": "So it is worth pointing out here that Santorum is not, in fact, all that Catholic.\n\nLet me put that another way. Obviously, Rick Santorum is a Catholic. I have no doubt that his relationship with his church is genuine, profound and sustaining on a personal level.\n\nBut just like every religious believer through the millennia, Santorum observes the teachings of his church selectively. In this political primary race, he has advertised (or implicated) his Catholic bona fides when talking about abortion and contraception, and he has invoked his faith more broadly on issues such as pornography and family values. But on the following issues, Santorum\u2019s position diverges \u2014 sometimes a lot \u2014 from that of his church.\n\n1. The death penalty: \u201cEnding the death penalty would be one important step away from a culture of death and toward building a culture of life,\u201d wrote the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2005. Both Benedict XVI and John Paul II opposed the death penalty and praised foreign leaders who abolished it.\n\nSantorum supports it. In the 1990s, he voted against replacing the death penalty with life imprisonment and for a motion that would limit inmates\u2019 appeals in death-penalty cases. Recently, though, the former senator seems be suffering pricks of conscience. \u201cIf there is not certainty, under the law, the death penalty should not be used,\u201d he told Piers Morgan this year.\n\n2. Torture: The catechism of the Catholic Church clearly opposes it: \u201cTorture, which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity.\u201d\n\nSantorum endorses it. He doesn\u2019t call it torture, though. He calls it \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques.\u201d\n\n3. Nuclear Iran: On what is perhaps the most pressing foreign policy issue of the day, the Catholic Church urges restraint. \u201cIn Catholic teaching, use of force must always be a last resort,\u201d wrote Bishop Richard E. Pates in a recent letter from the bishops\u2019 conference. \u201cDiscussing or promoting military options at this time is unwise and may be counterproductive.\u201d\n\nSantorum believes that America should threaten Iran with bombs. \u201cI would be saying to the Iranians, you either open up those facilities . . . or we will degrade those facilities through airstrikes,\u201d he said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\n4. Immigration: Only on this issue has Santorum explicitly distanced himself from the church he loves so much. The Catholic bishops support immigration reform that includes a way for illegal aliens to earn citizenship. Santorum wants to build a fence between the United States and Mexico. On his Web site, he conflates immigrants with \u201cdrug cartels, violent criminals and terrorists.\u201d Following the bishops\u2019 recommendations, said Santorum in December, \u201cwould be creating a huge magnet for people to come in and break the law some more.\u201d\n\nAt issue here is not Santorum\u2019s inconsistency. He is running for president, not for pope, and in any case, the best religious teaching sets high standards for behavior and action in the world; it does not demand blind obeisance. At issue is the myth, perpetuated by religionists on the right (including Santorum himself), that the selective and self-serving observance of religious rules and doctrines is a sin committed exclusively by the left. The practice is known as \u201ccherry picking.\u201d Both sides do it.\n\n\u201cWe do well among people who take their faith seriously,\u201d Santorum told Fox News last week. That\u2019s true only if what Santorum means by \u201cfaith\u201d is a set of politically motivated conservative beliefs, which don\u2019t have very much to do with religion at all.",

    "text": "Brad Grossman (@bradgro) is founder and CEO of Zeitguide, a cultural think-tank. He consults with executives about new developments in media, culture and technology.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that giving employees an outlet to be heard can not only improve retention and engagement, but also enable senior leaders to identify and reward the best ideas. But companies often struggle to create workplaces that enable open and productive communication and collaboration.\n\nIn attempting to address this particular problem, businesses have saddled employees with a host of other woes. Employees spend much of their day going from meeting to meeting. Their email inboxes are out of control. And in attempting to create physical workspaces that promote co-working (think of the classic image of a startup office with its open floor plan, ping-pong tables, speakers and bean-bag chairs), some have neglected to give employees space where they can get their own work done.\n\nThankfully, we may now have a solution that lends employees a voice and enables them and their teams to be more productive. It\u2019s all owing to what I like to call the \u201cSlackification\u201d of the workplace.\n\nYou may or may not be familiar with enterprise collaboration tools like Slack, HipChat and Lua that have been adopted early by more innovative departments in organizations. These applications bring the mechanisms of social media in-house to facilitate greater coordination and knowledge management in large, decentralized environments. These software tools not only provide an internal community of shared communication, but also a way to build on and track ideas and trends that the rest of the company is talking about.\n\nImagine this scenario: A senior executive tells her team of 500 that they need to read a particular white paper on customer service. To do so, she posts it on her company\u2019s Slack as part of a separate channel completely devoted to customer service. Her employees can now read, comment and exchange related articles on this same channel, much as they would with a group chat on Facebook.\n\nBy doing this, she isn\u2019t just explaining her interest in this report and how it could be valuable to her team; she is also allowing anyone on her team to comment or build on it. Now imagine one person, perhaps a more junior-level employee, offers a brilliant comment. Now all 500 employees can see it. In the same way that you can like a comment on Facebook or retweet on Twitter, that younger executive might get an overwhelming amount of reactions on the channel, making the person feel heard and feel like the boss is noticing the idea, which otherwise might never have reached the higher levels of the company.\n\nAnd, perhaps just as importantly, it takes the conversation away from the clutter of an email inbox and into a platform that allows everyone at the company to easily track and compartmentalize the conversation. This is especially valuable as companies become increasingly international and rely more and more on seamless communication between employees in multiple time zones.\n\nWe\u2019re in a cultural climate where people want purpose at work and to feel that their ideas can be considered by those beyond their peers and mid-level managers. They want to be part of the conversation and to have access to ears all the way to the top. They want the CEO to know them \u2013 even though in most cases, the C-suite doesn\u2019t even know they\u2019re on the team. This is especially so for millennials.\n\nSocial-enterprise tools can, as social era expert Nilfer Merchant once said, make \u201cthe 800-pound corporate gorilla act more like 800 gazelles \u2013 fast, nimble and collaborative.\u201d She said that four years ago. Now it\u2019s essential for corporations to finally buy in, whether they use services like Slack, HipChat, or create their own platforms to foster transparency and a better way to communicate. And, just as importantly, as a way to build purpose, community and put the entire company on the same page.\n\nRead the latest Leadership Report.",

That would mean that tens of thousands -- 20,000 out of every 100 million -- of users were affected.\n\nA Google spokesman told FoxNews.com Monday afternoon that all users would have their service back by the end of the day -- but it would be premature to speculate whether there would be any permanent data loss.\n\nAnd as of 12 p.m. EST Monday, the company was still working to fully resolve the issue.\n\n\"We've restored access for 1/3 of those users already,\" the Google spokesman said, \"and engineers are at work fixing it now. Every hour x percent more are restored.\"\n\n\"The remaining 0.013% of accounts are being restored on an ongoing basis, and we expect the issue to be resolved for everyone within 12 hours,\" the company wrote on its Apps Status Dashboard.\n\nGoogle engineers continue to study the service outage, and will post a complete report within 48 hour or so, the spokesman said, though he could confirm that the problem was \"an internal one.\"\n\nMeanwhile, locked-out and livid users have taken to the company's user forums in their quest for help.\n\n\"Yesterday I had exactly the same issues reported here: deletion of ALL mails, archives, labels, filters, pop/imap settings for alternative e-mail addresses, blackberry. It looks like a brand new Gmail account with 7.5GB storage space as opposed to the 25GB I paid for,\" one user wrote.\n\n\"Google support help please!\" wrote another desperate Gmail user. \"I cannot access my account, there is really valuable information there for me, this account have been my principal account for 4 years, I am really afraid to think about how much data I lost.\"\n\nAlex Chitu, whose blog charts the Google's cloud computing initiatives, told the BBC that such outages are rare. But tech site Engadget suggested that the event should serve as a wake-up call for users: Even services that work in the \"cloud\" -- meaning those that are accessible only online, through a browser -- can potentially fail. This latest incident underscores the need to back up files and data regularly.",

The Coral Gables-Fla.-based company made $1.5 billion in sales in 2008 and has 8.0% of the market for dermatology perscription treatments, Glaxo said Monday.\n\nShares of Glaxo ( GSK - news - people ) ticked up 0.1%, or 1.00 pence (1 cent), to 10.39 pence ($15.19) in morning trading in London. Glaxo, which is facing the patent expiration of its best-selling herpes treatment Valtrex at the end of 2009, said the deal would help it \"grow and diversify\" its business by providing new sales and synergy opportunities.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline will assume $400 million of Stiefel's debt as part of the deal and could make a further payment of $300 million depending on the target company's performance. The companies expect to deliver annual pre-tax cost savings of up to $240 million by 2012 with integration costs of approximately $325 million over the next three years, Glaxo said. \"This transaction will create a new world-leading, specialist dermatology business and re-energize our existing dermatology products,\" said Glaxo Chief Executive Andrew Witty.

I must have calls from 30 people wanting to know what they could do to help.\"\n\nBut court documents paint a sinister picture. Michael Barrett allegedly used a cell phone camera to shoot the videos of Andrews, 31, at the Marriott Nashville at Vanderbilt University and a Ramada in Milwaukee while she was on assignment last year.\n\nHe's charged with interstate stalking with intent to harass, intimidate and cause emotional distress to the victim.\n\nGrossman said the popular reporter isn't resting easy just yet.\n\n\"She's pleased with the arrest, but a bit apprehensive,\" Grossman said. She thinks employees at the hotels where Andrews stayed were feeding information to Michael Barrett and providing him with adjoining rooms, Grossman added.\n\nThe sportscaster - who is back on the sidelines at college football games after a break from her on-air duties - had never heard of or seen her alleged stalker before the feds showed her his picture, Grossman said.\n\nMichael Barrett, who faces five years in federal prison if convicted, was arrested late Friday night at O'Hare Airport.\n\nThe FBI says it learned Michael Barrett's identity by linking him to e-mails he sent to TMZ.\n\nHe was denied bail Saturday morning in U.S. District Court in Chicago and ordered returned to Los Angeles, where the charges were filed. The judge set another hearing for tomorrow to determine if Michael Barrett will be freed on bond or kept in custody.\n\nAndrews said she hoped the case would help other stalking victims.\n\n\"For my part, I will make every effort to strengthen the laws on a state and federal level to better protect victims of criminal stalking,\" she said.",

Lenders have faced a rising tide of restructured and non-performing assets, which account for more than 10 per cent of loans across the banking system.\n\nOn Monday, the RBI published rules proposing a new \"strategic debt restructuring scheme\", which allows banks to impose tough conditions on distressed companies that need to renegotiate existing loan agreements.\n\nThe rules potentially allow banks to convert these debts into a 51 per cent equity stake, if restructuring conditions are not met.\n\n\"If they can do this, it would be a massively significant change, given this has been basically impossible in India before,\" said Ravi Trivedi, a financial services analyst and former head of banking at KPMG in India.\n\nRead MoreNarendra Modi: Some in India impatient for faster change\n\n\"He [Rajan] is saying 'enough is enough'. We have given you guys enough chances. The situation isn't improving. So here are we going to give the banks the teeth that they need,\" Mr Trivedi said.\n\nThe rules follow mounting frustration in India over the inability of the country's state-dominated banking system to grapple with heavily indebted companies.\n\nRecent years have thrown up numerous examples of tycoons who suffered limited consequences from their companies being unable to pay debts, including flamboyant liquor and airline baron Vijay Mallya, whose carrier Kingfisher was grounded due to financial difficulties in 2012.\n\nMr Rajan warned last month that India's problem with bad debts might not have reached its peak, raising concerns that a legacy of troubled loans could undermine the country's tentative economic recovery.\n\nMore from The Financial Times:\n\nPaul Volcker warns on health of US state finances Wearables at work: the new frontier of employee surveillance Apple launches new streaming service\n\nAnalysts said the rules could face legal challenges from business owners unhappy with equity conversion rules. The RBI's move also relies on the willingness of India's traditionally cautious public sector banks to use their new powers.\n\nHowever, if the rules do see banks taking control of indebted companies, that could lead to new ownership of some of India's businesses, according to Shinjini Kumar, a director and banking specialist at PwC India\n\n\"Private equity as well as turnround specialists will find new business here because of this,\" she says. \"It would be a big change, and certainly a step in the right direction.\"",

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) is walking down just got even lonelier.\n\nThe top two Republicans in the Senate made clear Monday they will not join Cruz\u2019s call for a filibuster of a government funding bill that cleared the House last week. Their decisions signaled that the fiery freshman\u2019s plan isn\u2019t good politics even for Republicans facing conservative primary threats and reinforced a widely held view that it won\u2019t work in practice.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), center, flanked by Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), left, and Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, gestures during a March 12 news conference in Washington. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\n\u201cSenator McConnell supports the House Republicans\u2019 bill and will not vote to block it, since it defunds Obamacare and funds the government without increasing spending by a penny,\u201d said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nWith that, Stewart ended the possibility McConnell might join Cruz\u2019s corner, which is sparsely populated in the upper chamber in this fight.\n\nWhile the House last week gave Cruz and his cohort exactly what they wanted \u2014 a bill that keeps the government running but cuts off funding for Obamacare \u2014 he\u2019s called on his colleagues to block it from advancing in the Senate. Why? To prevent Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) from stripping out the provision that defunds the health-care law and passing a new version restoring funding with a simple majority vote.\n\nMcConnell and Cornyn support defunding Obamacare, which they are demonstrating by not blocking the bill that cleared the House. But they are not supporting Cruz\u2019s push to prevent Reid from remaking the measure, which he will do if Cruz can\u2019t round up 40 additional votes to block him.\n\nIt was a virtual lock going into Monday that Cruz\u2019s plan wouldn\u2019t end up winning much support. What was unclear was whether he would coax any Republicans of note to join him.\n\nThe fact that McConnell will not speaks volumes. The Kentucky Republican has drawn a primary challenger who is running to his right in a conservative state. Moreover, McConnell has been very careful not to do anything to irk a conservative base already skeptical of him. His decision not to join Cruz suggests he (1) Doesn\u2019t think his idea will lead anywhere and (2) Doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s good politics, either.\n\nNeither apparently does Minority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who\u2019s also not going to filibuster. \u201cSenator Cornyn will support the House bill that defunds Obamacare. He will not block a bill that defunds Obamacare,\u201d said Cornyn spokeswoman Megan Mitchell.\n\nCornyn doesn\u2019t face a serious primary challenger, but is taking the potential threat of one very seriously.\n\nIn his first nine months in the Senate, Cruz has quickly become a leading figure in the conservative movement. He\u2019s a hero in the eyes of many voters Cornyn and McConnell simply cannot afford to alienate. That\u2019s made it risky for them to split with the freshman on major issues. Until now, they largely haven\u2019t in major policy debates.\n\nBut the fact that they are breaking with him now supports the argument that Cruz has overreached on an issue (Obamacare) that Republicans felt good about homing in on heading toward the midterm elections. And it clears the way for other Republican senators to follow their lead.\n\nIn the end, this entire episode may not hurt Cruz\u2019s standing among his enthusiastic base of unwavering conservatives across the country. It might even make him a bigger star in their eyes.\n\nBut inside Washington, it\u2019s a different story. He\u2019s already enraged House Republicans by seeking to shift the burden of responsibility to them in the effort to defund Obamacare. And now, he\u2019s failed to win over two senators badly in need of conservative cred wherever they can get it.\n\nHas the Obamacare fight helped Cruz? Depends on where. Inside the halls of Congress, the answer looks like a pretty definitive no at this point.\n\nA new Washington Post-Abt SRBI poll shows former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe leading Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R) 47 percent to 39 percent in the Virginia governor\u2019s race.

    "text": "Josh Haner/The New York Times\n\nUsain Bolt, front, helped set a new world record in the 4x100-meter relay with his Jamaican teammates.\n\nLONDON \u2014 Usain Bolt anchored Jamaica\u2019s 4x100-meter relay team to a new world record on Saturday night, giving him three gold medals at the London Games and further cementing his status as the greatest sprinter in history.\n\nAllyson Felix handing off to Francena McCorory during the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 4x400-meter relay.\n\nBolt had already defended his Olympic titles in the 100 meters and the 200 meters. He even did a few pushups after the 200 on Thursday for show. For his encore on Saturday night, exactly 24 hours before the closing ceremony for the London Games, he gave the Olympic Stadium crowd one more spectacle.\n\nThe quartet of Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, Yohan Blake and Bolt finished in 36.84 seconds, breaking their own year-old mark of 37.10. The United States team of Trell Kimmons, Justin Gatlin, Tyson Gay and Ryan Bailey tied the previous mark of 37.04 and won silver. After Canada was disqualified, Trinidad moved up to third.\n\nAfter taking the baton from Blake, Bolt blazed past the U.S. anchor, Ryan Bailey. As he neared the finish line, the outcome was no longer in doubt, but it remained to be seen was how he would celebrate. Would he put a finger to his lips, as if to silence his doubters, as he had after winning the 200 meters? Or might he send an invisible arrow skyward?\n\nBefore the race, Bolt had done his archer routine and flexed his muscles. Maybe he was just trying to stay warm. He came onto the track wearing a stocking cap to ward off a cool wind. It was Bolt\u2019s sixth gold medal in two Olympics and his first world record of these Games.\n\nBolt\u2019s post-race celebration was subdued by his standards. He saluted the crowd and allowed himself to be swallowed up by a few supporters.\n\nThe Americans figured to give the Jamaicans all they could handle. In their semifinal on Friday night, the American quartet of Jeffery Demps, Darvis Patton, Kimmons and Gatlin clocked a 37.40, the fourth-fastest time in history.\n\nThe power of Usain Bolt is evident not only in the ground he covers with every elongated stride but in the attention he commands with every step. And not just from track fans but from fellow Olympians like Brenda Villa, a gold-medal winning water polo player from the United States, who said, \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty amazing when you get people from all over the world wanting to root for one person.\u201d\n\nWith no host team in the 4x100-meter relay final, the partisan fans at Olympic Stadium were free to cheer Bolt as if he were a Brit, and they deafeningly did, affording him the same roar as their own Mo Farah, who added the 5,000 to his 10,000 title earlier.\n\nIn the other relay final on Saturday night, the United States pulled away for gold in the 4x400.\n\nThe last time the United States lost an Olympic women\u2019s 4x400-meter relay final, in 1992, Francena McCorory was 3-years-old.\n\nOn Saturday night, McCorory ran the third leg for the American squad that continued its dominance in the event. The quartet of DeeDee Trotter, Allyson Felix, McCorory and Sanya Richards-Ross was timed in 3 minutes 16.87 seconds, well ahead of the silver medalists from Russia (3:20.23). Jamaica took third in 3:20.95.\n\nWith an opening leg of 49.57, Trotter handed Felix a lead of several meters, which she expanded with a split of 48.85. McCorory ran a 48.85 split and Richards-Ross came home in 49.07. The previous night, the 4x100 relay, which featured Felix, broke a world record that had stood for 27 years. For a while, it appeared that another bolt might strike out. But in the end, the 24-year-old world record of 3:15.17, set by the Soviet Union, was safe.\n\nFor Felix, 26, the relay offered a sense of what might have been. Her best time in the 400 meters, a 49.70, would have tied for the silver medal here but she bypassed the event here in favor of the 100 meters.",

    "text": "For newlyweds these days, returning wedding gifts is as much a rite of passage as taking a honeymoon or opening a joint bank account.\n\nDespite creating intricate wish lists -- otherwise known as gift registries -- couples still wind up with plenty of presents they don't want or cannot keep. Some guests never check to see if a couple is registered, resulting in duplicate gifts. In other cases, couples find they simply don't have room for that nifty bread maker in their cramped apartments after all. Another factor: Couples that create registries just to appease relatives or guests -- the brides know all along that they're going to return that china from Bergdorf's for some Manolo Blahnik shoes.\n\nAll of this means that couples can spend as much time returning gifts as picking them out in the first place. In part to attract more of the $6 billion registry industry (the figure comes from Fairchild Bridal Infobank), some stores are now making it easier for brides and grooms to trade in their bounty. Crate and Barrel, for instance, just lengthened the time that you can return a gift after purchase to 90 days from 30 days. Bed Bath & Beyond's \"hassle-free\" return policy gives couples registered with the store up to two years to bring back gifts for cash.\n\nAfter our 250-person wedding in May, which followed a string of engagement parties and bridal showers, we were swimming in extraneous gifts, from mini-Cuisinarts to vases and serving bowls. (Sorry: No more details about the gifts -- we don't want to lose all of our friends and family.)\n\nWe were dreading the gift-return experience, imagining long lines and lots of paperwork. What we found surprised us -- pleasantly.\n\nOne thing's for sure: It pays to ask for what you want. Many stores' policies -- as described on their Web sites and by floor staff -- say that merchandise credit is the only option, and that returns must be made within 30 days. But in our case, with a little prodding, several stores departed from their stated policies.\n\nAt the Crate and Barrel in the Mall at Short Hills, N.J., the chatty saleswoman announced to us that we could get store credit for our items. \"What are our options?\" we asked.\n\n\"That is your option,\" she replied. But she agreed to double-check with the manager and found that the store could indeed give us a refund. Within two weeks we received a check for $93.81.\n\nAt Williams-Sonoma in Princeton, N.J., the salesman first offered us only store credit. But when we pressed him and his associate on other options, they said we could get a refund because we were returning so much merchandise. Within days, a crisp check for $338.14 arrived in the mail.\n\nThat may have been a lucky break for us, as the store's return policy says that it only offers merchandise credit for gift returns.\n\nThe Williams-Sonoma experience wasn't without a hitch. The store re-sent us several of the baking dishes that we had just returned, and we had to trek back to the store to re-return the returns. To compensate us for the inconvenience, Williams-Sonoma issued us extra merchandise credit, while letting us keep the baking dishes if we wanted to.\n\nReturn policies can vary widely from company to company -- even within the same chain of stores -- so other gift returners may not all experience the exact same results. In our case, though, we took back more than a dozen gifts, and walked away with an extra $730 in our bank account and hundreds of dollars more in store credit.\n\nAt Bloomingdale's, also in Short Hills, we didn't even have to ask for cash back. The store's customer-service representative simply offered it. The return only took about five minutes -- it was the fastest of the five stores we tested. But the rep cautioned that it would take up to eight weeks for a refund check to arrive.\n\nTiffany & Co. requires that gifts be returned within 30 days, according to its store policy. But at the shop in Short Hills we had no problem bringing back presents that had been bought more than six months earlier. Getting cash back wasn't an option -- the company policy is to give merchandise credit only.\n\nAt Pottery Barn in Manhattan, we didn't have a receipt, so the store gave us credit for the current selling price of the gift. What did we do with the credit? Bought a gift for an upcoming wedding that our friends will probably end up returning.\n\nSTORE: Bed Bath & Beyond RETURN TIME FRAME: Registrants have two years for full refund REFUND OPTIONS: Cash back, exchange or store credit for gift-registry items within 24 months. RECEIPT NEEDED?: No, for items bought from a gift registry COMMENT: Less restrictive than many other gift-registry return policies\n\nSTORE: Bloomingdale's RETURN TIME FRAME: Policy doesn't state one REFUND OPTIONS: Refund with receipt; otherwise, merchandise credit RECEIPT NEEDED?: No, but without one, \"you will receive the lowest selling price of the past six months\" COMMENT: We were in and out of the store in five minutes. But refund check can take up to eight weeks to arrive\n\nSTORE: Crate and Barrel RETURN TIME FRAME: 90 days REFUND OPTIONS: Refund or gift card with valid gift receipt RECEIPT NEEDED?: Returns without a receipt require driver's license or other state ID. COMMENT: If you exchange a gift for a gift card and register it on the Web site, the store replaces the card if it's lost or stolen\n\nSTORE: Pottery Barn RETURN TIME FRAME: Within a year REFUND OPTIONS: Merchandise credit with a gift receipt RECEIPT NEEDED?: Without a receipt, you only get credit for the lowest selling price COMMENT: Must have a valid ID card to return any gifts\n\nSTORE: Tiffany & Co. RETURN TIME FRAME: Within 30 days REFUND OPTIONS: Merchandise credit only for gifts RECEIPT NEEDED?: Return in original packaging, \"with the receipt if available,\" the Web site says COMMENT: We were able to return gifts at least six months old, without receipts, with no problem\n\nSTORE: Williams-Sonoma RETURN TIME FRAME: No deadline REFUND OPTIONS: Merchandise credit only for gifts RECEIPT NEEDED?: With no gift receipt, you'll only get credit at the current selling price COMMENT: We managed to get a full refund, despite the corporate policy; the company says that's not typical\n\nSTORE: Amazon.com RETURN TIME FRAME: Within 30 days of delivery REFUND OPTIONS: Credit only for registry gifts, but for gifts bought from other merchants on Amazon, their own policies apply RECEIPT NEEDED?: Packing slip must be marked as a gift, otherwise credit will go to gift-giver. COMMENT: Some curious exceptions: Any item that is gas-powered or contains flammable liquids, for example, cannot be returned",

Significantly, the request included an appeal for all member states to release any hitherto unpublished records \u2014 a reference aimed largely at securing the declassification of American and British files, particularly intercepts thought to have been made at the time by the National Security Agency of the United States.\n\nThe issue is not simply a matter of historical loose ends. \u201cThis has been an open wound in Sweden for more than 50 years,\u201d the Swedish envoy to the United Nations, Per Thoresson, told Agence France-Presse. \u201cWe are anxious to try to make closure.\u201d\n\nA definitive explanation of the crash would throw light on a critical moment in Africa\u2019s history during the Cold War. It coincided with a time of secession in the neighboring Congolese province of Katanga, where Belgian and other Western mining concerns held huge and lucrative concessions producing uranium and cobalt.\n\nMr. Hammarskjold was on his way to meet a Katangese separatist leader, Moise Tshombe, in Ndola when his plane came down in wooded terrain a few miles from the airport. Delays in locating the wreckage magnified the question of whether pilot error was to blame, as one early inquiry suggested, or whether there had been foul play.\n\nConspiracy theories flourished: Had the United Nations official died in the crash, or was he killed afterward by mercenaries? Had South Africa sabotaged the plane? Was it deliberately shot down to thwart Mr. Hammarskjold\u2019s mission?\n\nIn a report issued in September 2013, a United Nations panel, led by Stephen Sedley, a retired British judge, referred to evidence of a second airplane flying close to or alongside the DC-6 carrying Mr. Hammarskjold, the Albertina.\n\nA Belgian former pilot was quoted as saying that he had been under orders to force the plane to divert to Kolwezi, a mining center in Katanga, and had fired warning shots that accidentally clipped the DC-6 and brought it down.\n\n\u201cThe aerial attack claim,\u201d the report said, \u201cis in our judgment capable of proof or disproof.\u201d\n\nIt concluded, moreover, that the United States had access to crucial evidence that could prove to be a so-called golden thread in a maze of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cIt is highly likely that the entirety of the local and regional Ndola radio traffic on the night of 17-18 September 1961 was tracked and recorded by the N.S.A., and possibly also by the C.I.A.,\u201d the report said.\n\nIndeed, the report continued, a Freedom of Information Act request to the N.S.A. drew a response that two of three documents it sought \u201cappeared to be exempt from disclosure by reason of \u2018top secret' classification on national security grounds.\u201d\n\nIn his request for a new inquiry at the United Nations on Monday, Mr. Thoresson, the Swedish diplomat, repeated the call for secret documents to be released. The aim, he said, is \u201cto help shed new light on the circumstances surrounding the death of Dag Hammarskjold and those on board his flight, not only by bringing existing documents forward, but also by providing the conditions necessary to finally hear witnesses whose testimony has so far not been given due attention.\u201d",

    "text": "SADDLE BROOK, N.J. \u2013 The battle for shoppers is playing out in this New York suburb: Wal-Mart versus everyone else.\n\nDollar stores beckon, their small size ideal for quick shopping. Target offers 5 percent off if you pay with its store-branded card. Costco tempts with high-end, brand-name food and designer clothes at competitive prices.\n\nBernadette Clark used to visit Wal-Mart here twice a week. Now it's twice a month. She got fed up last year when Wal-Mart stopped stocking some of her favorite brands and she couldn't count on low prices.\n\n\"It gave me the opportunity to look elsewhere,\" she says. \"I shop around more.\"\n\nThree years ago, Wal-Mart ruled for convenience, selection and price. But today it is losing customers and revenue, and smarting from decisions that backfired.\n\nWal-Mart is not in danger of ceding its place atop the retail world. But competitors have begun to chip away at its dominance.\n\nOver the last year, revenue at Wal-Mart stores open at least a year has fallen by an average 0.75 percent each quarter, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. Revenue rose by an average of nearly 1.7 percent at Target, 8 percent at Costco and 5.9 percent at Family Dollar.\n\nTo fight back, Wal-Mart is again emphasizing low prices and adding back thousands of products it had culled in an overzealous bid to clean up stores. It's also plotting an expansion into cities, even neighborhoods where others dare not go.\n\n\"We are running a better business because our competitors cause us to raise our own game,\" Wal-Mart CEO Mike Duke told The Associated Press in an interview. Wal-Mart expects to halt the decline in revenue when it reports results from its fourth quarter this month.\n\nUnlike most stores, Wal-Mart thrived when the Great Recession struck in late 2007. Its core customers \u2014 households making less than $70,000 a year \u2014 bought more. For many, it became the only place they shopped. Affluent shoppers became price conscious and discovered Wal-Mart's prices were hard to beat.\n\nAll of Wal-Mart's $27 billion in revenue growth for the year ending in January 2009 came from greater demand for basic items \u2014 food, pharmacy and household goods. Shoppers spent 13 percent more on basics at Wal-Mart that year.\n\nShoppers also liked that Wal-Mart's stores looked neater. The company was finishing a major renovation to address complaints that its stores were messy. Wal-Mart widened aisles, eliminated clutter, improved lighting and lowered shelves.\n\nFamily Dollar and Dollar General posed little threat. Their stores generally were dingy, and their shelves were filled with low-quality clothing and housewares. The groceries weren't major brands.\n\nTarget, meanwhile, struggled with the perception that its prices were high. And stores filled with non-essential items \u2014 think brightly colored, decorative pillows and kitchen accessories \u2014 didn't appeal to shoppers focused on making ends meet.\n\nSo Wal-Mart had a competitive edge. It lasted until June 2009, the month that economists would later determine was the end of the Great Recession.\n\nAround that time, Wal-Mart's renovation started to backfire. As part of its store overhaul, it had removed thousands of products from its shelves. Gone were top-selling toothbrushes and other things that people counted on Wal-Mart to stock, like handkerchiefs. Wal-Mart got rid of 20 percent of its groceries, about 10,000 items in that area of the store, says Burt Flickinger, who runs the consulting firm Strategy Resource Group.\n\nShoppers began complaining that Wal-Mart no longer had items they wanted, even some of their favorite brands. Revenue began to decline.\n\n\"We cleaned the stores up, but we cleaned them up too much,\" says Duke, who had become CEO just months before, in February 2009.\n\nWal-Mart's next mistake was pricing. Over the past year, it had strayed from its \"everyday low prices\" slogan, the bedrock philosophy of founder and namesake Sam Walton. Wal-Mart was less aggressive about being the low-price leader. Instead, the company slashed prices only on select products, and the deals were temporary. The idea was to draw customers into stores for the bargains and hope they would also pick up other, more profitable items.\n\nLast Memorial Day weekend. Wal-Mart advertised dramatic price cuts on 22 items, including a 40-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup for $1, less than half price.\n\nThe economy was still weak. Customers were scrutinizing prices as many had never before. They discovered that Wal-Mart couldn't be counted on to have the lowest price on some items, if it stocked them at all.\n\nWal-Mart's mistakes have had a lasting sting.\n\nShoppers are no longer confident that they can \"take care of their shopping list on one trip and get rock bottom prices,\" says Robert Buchanan, an independent retail stock analyst.\n\nRevenue at Wal-Mart stores open at least a year, a key measurement of any retailer's health, has fallen for six straight quarters. That is the longest such stretch since at least 1980, when ICSC chief economist Michael Niemira began tracking the figures.\n\nWal-Mart executives have acknowledged that fewer people have walked into its stores every quarter for the past year compared with the corresponding period a year earlier.\n\nWhile Wal-Mart has lost shoppers, competitors have gained.\n\n\u2014 Dollar stores are winning over customers with convenience. Their parking lots and stores are less than a tenth the size of those at most Wal-Marts. They stock eggs and milk in coolers up front near the registers. Bread is on a nearby shelf. That makes it easier for shoppers to get in and out quickly. They're carrying more major brands, especially food.\n\nShoppers spend about the same as they did a year ago at Family Dollar \u2014 about $10 a trip on average \u2014 but they're coming in more often, the company says.\n\nCombined, Family Dollar and Dollar General took in about $20 billion in the last fiscal year, just 5 percent of Wal-Mart's $408 billion in revenue. But together they have thousands more stores than Wal-Mart, and their revenue is growing at an enviable rate.\n\n\"The number of openings of dollar stores, and just the sheer density and convenience has been a (competitive) factor\" for Wal-Mart, Duke says. \"There's no doubt the customer wants value, but they also want convenience.\"\n\nFamily Dollar's strategy is to blanket a region with stores, clustering them sometimes less than a mile apart and along bus routes. Dollar General has more than 9,000 stores and says it sees 12,000 more in its future, including plans for 625 this year.\n\nIn Saddle Brook, Cindy Collins, 50, and her mother, Winnie, 71, could go to Wal-Mart for everything they need. But they favor the nearby Dollar General, which opened a year ago, for their weekly shopping.\n\n\"We can get cereal, paper products, cat food or whatever we need here. It's also easy to get in and out,\" says Cindy, who lives in nearby Elmwood Park.\n\n\u2014 Target scored a win against Wal-Mart with its 5 percent discount for purchases paid with a Target credit or debit card. The incentive, launched in October, applies to everything sold in its stores, from toys to fast-selling iPads.\n\nWal-Mart won't match the discount, even though it's losing customers like Tomacinia Carter. She lives closer to the Wal-Mart in Saddle Brook, but chose to shop a Target in Paramus because of the discount. She saved $4.60 on a recent trip. \"It does add up over time,\" she says.\n\n\"That is hammering Wal-Mart,\" says Craig Johnson, who runs the consulting firm Customer Growth Partners.\n\nDuke says loyalty and credit card programs are expensive to run and Wal-Mart wants to give low prices to all shoppers.\n\nTarget is Wal-Mart's largest rival, though its revenue of $65 billion for its last fiscal year was only one-sixth of Wal-Mart's. Target has maintained its reputation for stylish clothes at low prices. It's also added fresh fruits and vegetables to an expanded grocery section.\n\n\u2014 Wholesale clubs, particularly Costco, weathered the recession and are picking up Wal-Mart customers, too. Shoppers are drawn by things like premium beef at competitive prices and well-known brands, such as coats from designer Michael Kors that are offered at steep discounts and in limited quantities. Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi describes shopping at Costco as a \"treasure hunt.\"\n\nCostco's membership, which includes small businesses, grew by 2 million to 58 million last fiscal year. Customers shopped its warehouses more often and spent about 2.5 percent more on each visit than they did in 2009, the company says.\n\nWal-Mart hopes the holiday season marked the end of the declining revenue. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect Wal-Mart to report a 0.9 percent increase in revenue for the November through January quarter. Wal-Mart will release its quarterly and year-end results Feb. 22.\n\nWal-Mart expects other changes to fuel growth. They include:\n\n\u2014 Going beyond the return to \"everyday low prices.\" Wal-Mart upped the ante in the fall by pledging to match competitors' prices. The company is also pressing its suppliers to give it the lowest prices on goods including clothes, food and cosmetics, says Cameron Smith, a recruiter for Wal-Mart vendors.\n\n\u2014 Restocking thousands of grocery items. It plans to finish adding back products to all its departments by spring.\n\n\u2014 Revamping its clothing department to focus on basics like socks, underwear and no-frills jeans, which are selling better than other clothes.\n\n\u2014 Collaborating with suppliers to offer products in smaller sizes, most for under a dollar.\n\n\u2014 Opening more smaller stores. Some will be less than 30,000 square feet, about a sixth of the size of the average Wal-Mart store. These will be in towns the company figures can't support a big-box store, in an effort to go head-to-head with dollar stores.\n\nThe company is also looking to follow the success of Home Depot and Target by moving into urban areas.\n\nIt's already moving into Chicago, and is looking at sites in Washington. Duke says Wal-Mart has its eye on New York, too, where Wal-Mart calculates that city dwellers using credit cards spent $165 million at Wal-Marts in the suburbs last year.\n\nAnd Wal-Mart plans to tap markets where no one else goes. Duke calls them \"food deserts,\" city neighborhoods where the few places to shop have limited products, few healthy options and high prices.\n\n\"We have an opportunity here to grow our business, to serve more customers, to open stores, and that is something we are positive about,\" Duke says.\n\nWal-Mart still faces obstacles. Rising gas prices and high unemployment hurt Wal-Mart's working-class customers. Soaring prices for commodities may make groceries more expensive for the retailer.\n\nBut the company has righted itself before. Underestimating Wal-Mart would be a mistake, warns Joe Feldman, a managing director at Telsey Advisory Group, a research company.\n\n\"The company always figures it out.\"",

    "text": "Three boys chase each other and a small dog around a tree at the West Calumet public housing project in East Chicago, Indiana, under the watchful eyes of 80-year-old Mary Fluellen .\n\n\u201cWash your hands when you get inside!\u201d says Fluellen, better known as \u201cGranny\u201d around the complex.\n\nOver the past few weeks residents have received notices telling them to wash their hands thoroughly and leave their shoes at the door, to avoid spreading lead that has been found in dangerously high levels in soil at the housing project.\n\nBut such precautionary measures seem futile after years of families living amid the contamination.\n\n\u201cWe used to have mud fights and play slip-and-slide\u201d on the wet grass, remembers Anthony Abbey, 33, who grew up in the housing complex.\n\n\u201cYou were throwing lead at each other,\u201d notes Mario Irving.\n\nThe community of about 1,100 mostly African American residents of the housing project has been reeling since receiving word in the past month that they have to relocate. The tidy two-storey brick units where many have lived for decades will be torn down because of massive levels of lead and arsenic contamination in the soil, deceptively masked by lush green grass and clumps of flowers.\n\nThere have been concerns about lead contamination for decades, and tests by the US Environmental Protection Agency a decade ago found hot spots of serious contamination. But federal and state officials had concluded residents were not at risk until the May release of comprehensive soil test results, which showed more than half the project\u2019s yards exceeded lead levels that would trigger emergency cleanup, and many also had high levels of arsenic.\n\nMany residents say they were unaware of the situation until they received letters in July from the city\u2019s mayor, Anthony Copeland, noting the findings and stating: \u201cWe feel it is in your best interest to temporarily relocate your household.\u201d\n\nSince then, local children and adults have been getting blood tests. Many have come back showing serious levels of lead; others are awaiting their results, and still others have gotten results that are considered safe. But people who have lost all trust in official sources don\u2019t believe them.\n\nParents and grandparents say they are torn between competing impulses: anxious to move out of an environment that may be causing children irreversible harm, but wary of shattering a community home to many extended families and lifelong friends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tight-knit,\u201d said Milton Ross, a wiry 62-year-old construction worker who lives with his mother in the complex. \u201cWhen I first heard, my heart told Jesus: \u2018Wherever we all go, I hope there are a lot of events where we can come back and get together.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere have been concerns about lead contamination in the soil here since at least 1985, when a nearby lead smelter shut down. In soil tests released in 2006, the EPA found seriously elevated lead levels in some areas. Those spots were cleaned up, and in 2009 the site was added to the Superfund National Priorities List. The federal government oversaw blood tests of local children. But in 2011 a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report saying that declining numbers of children with elevated blood lead levels led them to conclude the contamination did not pose a public health threat.\n\nThe EPA cited this finding as the reason it did not more aggressively continue to test the soil, at least not until it had to develop a cleanup plan under an agreement with the companies responsible for polluting the area, the DuPont chemical company and Atlantic Richfield Company.\n\nThe results released in May showed soil in the majority of yards above the EPA\u2019s 1,200 parts per million standard for emergency cleanup.\n\nThe EPA maintains it could remediate the soil in yards and residents could continue living there. But city officials said they think the lead stirred up during remediation would be a risk to residents. And since the city had already decided the complex would be demolished in coming years, officials decided it wouldn\u2019t make sense to remediate it.\n\nNow residents are getting Housing Choice Vouchers that subsidize rental units. But there are ceilings on how much rent the voucher will cover, and many prospective renters struggle to find landlords who will accept the vouchers.\n\nCity attorney Carla Morgan said that officials are scrambling to find new homes for the 357 families who live in the West Calumet project.\n\nWhile the West Calumet housing complex will be evacuated and torn down, the EPA is testing soil across the rest of the USS Lead Superfund site, filled with single-family homes, small businesses, multiple churches and a relatively new but now vacant elementary school. The agency has estimated 723 of 1,271 parcels in the area will need to be cleaned up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m praying,\u201d said Jennifer Sims, 57, who lives in her childhood home a few blocks from the housing project. Sims grew up playing in the housing project, and remembers that \u201cmothers and families lived on the gardens\u201d growing vegetables in the tainted soil. \u201cWhy did they do this to us?\u201d\n\nThe impacts of longstanding lead contamination in West Calumet could also stretch to surrounding areas, where many people who grew up there have dispersed.\n\nTyra Taylor, 45, raised her three kids in West Calumet. Her daughter, now 25, has epilepsy and cervical cancer, she said. And Taylor suffers from a long list of health problems including neuropathy, glaucoma and a disorder which causes her to faint frequently. Now living in a rental unit a block away, she thinks the lead and arsenic contamination explain a lot about the family\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the lead!\u201d she says, throwing her arms wide.\n\nLike many residents, she is angry that the housing authority and EPA continued to allow residents to live in the project after contamination was suspected and then confirmed.\n\nResidents said they never would have moved here if they knew about the contamination, but they said they were left in the dark until just recently.\n\nRobert Kaplan, the EPA Region 5 acting administrator, noted that over the years there have been multiple public comment periods, meetings hosted in local libraries and postcards sent out about the soil testing and cleanup plans.\n\n\u201cI understand that there are newer residents and people moving in and out, so outreach can be difficult,\u201d Kaplan said, but \u201cunder the usual Superfund process, everything is public notice ... We received no public comment including from the city.\u201d\n\nMany residents attribute the situation to racism; national pundits have compared it to the debacle in Flint, Michigan, where officials let residents drink contaminated water for months.\n\n\u201cThey think because we stay over here we\u2019re nothing, we\u2019re lowlifes, we\u2019re black and we\u2019re poor, they treat us like dogs,\u201d said Irving, who is a single father and a student at Ivy Tech community college. \u201cThey\u2019re killing us softly.\u201d\n\nMorgan said the current mayoral administration cannot be accused of environmental injustice since Copeland has been proactive on the issue, and since city officials are largely African American and from similar socioeconomic backgrounds to the affected residents. The EPA did not respond to a question about residents\u2019 feelings of injustice.\n\nMeanwhile Taylor prefers to temper her anger with laughter.\n\n\u201cIf you scratch our arms along a piece of paper, you can write, like a pencil,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the lead!\u201d",

    "text": "Vernazza is arguably the most photogenic \u2014 and popular \u2014 village, so arrive early before it\u2019s overrun with day-trippers. Pop into Batti Batti\u2019, a hole-in-the-wall focacceria, for a take-away breakfast of cheesy focaccia di Recco or pesto-slathered pizza (4 euros each). Then head to the quay to picnic while admiring the lemon-hued church, bobbing boats in the harbor and the pretty main piazza slowly coming to life.\n\nThe Cinque Terre has fewer historical sites worth exploring than its southerly neighbor, Portovenere, a coastal town so closely related that it falls under the same Unesco World Heritage site designation. From Vernazza, hop on the first Consorzio Marittimo Turistico ferry heading south (30 euros round-trip), and after an hour of marveling at the cinematic coastline from the sea, alight in Portovenere\u2019s picturesque marina. Then stroll past colorful houses crammed shoulder-to-shoulder along the waterfront en route to the Chiesa di San Pietro. This striped 12th-century church appears to have grown organically from the rocky peninsula where the crashing waves of the Mediterranean meet the Gulf of La Spezia. Afterward investigate Byron\u2019s Grotto, a natural cove nearby named for the 19th-century English poet who, according to local lore, swam from here to San Terenzo across the gulf, over four miles away.\n\nThere might be no more glamorous way to travel in Italy than by Venetian water taxi, which is precisely the polished vessel that will be waiting in Portovenere\u2019s harbor when you reserve a table for lunch at Locanda Lorena. This seaside inn and restaurant, just a few minutes away on the sparsely populated island of Palmaria, has a large covered terrace where well-heeled locals gather at tables draped in white linens to dine on fritto misto, lobster-stuffed ravioli and overflowing platters of grilled fish and crustaceans. Lunch for two, about 120 euros.\n\nBefore the last ferry departs for Cinque Terre, spend an hour in the shops lining the narrow alleys and steep staircases of Portovenere\u2019s historic center. Start on Via Capellini, a stone-paved pedestrian lane where you\u2019ll find Olioteca Bansigo, a specialty store celebrating the olive in various forms, from oils and tapenades to beautiful olive-wood serving spoons and cutting boards. Across the street, fragrant basil plants flank the entrance to Bajeic\u00f2, a pesto shop selling the local basil-based sauce and related products like fresh pasta. And up a nearby staircase, the tiny ceramics workshop La Bottega di Rena produces pretty handcrafted pieces such as glazed bowls shaped like fishing boats.\n\nReturn to Riomaggiore and follow signs for the Via dell\u2019Amore. This romantic cliff-top path, part of the Sentiero Azzurro, is closed indefinitely, but similar views can be found at A Pi\u00e8 de M\u00e0, a cafe and bar in a magnificent location near the trailhead. At a table on the terrace, high above the churning sea, try a glass of Cinque Terre wine from Walter de Batt\u00e8, a small artisanal producer of the region\u2019s floral white blend (6 euros).\n\nPrefer eating among Italians rather than in a polyglot dining room? Then reserve a table at L\u2019Articiocca, a cozy restaurant that opened in 2013 on a quiet side street in Levanto, one train stop north of Monterosso. Once seated on the patio, start with the Levanto specialty gattafin, pastalike fritters stuffed with spinach and wild herbs.

    "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 As expected, both New York baseball teams will be well represented at the 2012 All-Star Game.\n\nFor the Yankees, Robinson Cano, Curtis Granderson and Derek Jeter were voted by fans into the American League starting lineup, and C. C. Sabathia was named as a member of the pitching staff.\n\nThe Mets will send three members of their organization to Kansas City, Mo., for the game July 10. R. A. Dickey, who leads the major leagues with 12 wins, was named to the pitching staff. Terry Collins, the Mets\u2019 manager, was previously named a member of Tony La Russa\u2019s coaching staff.\n\nThe only surprise of the day involved David Wright, who was named as a National League reserve, not voted as a starter, after a late surge of votes for Pablo Sandoval of the San Francisco Giants.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way the system is,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t disappointed I don\u2019t get a chance to start, but I\u2019m going to do everything I can to help win that game.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cLet\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that it\u2019s a great honor no matter how you get a chance to go.\u201d\n\nWright led Sandoval last week by several hundred thousand votes. That made Sandoval\u2019s eventual winning margin all the more surprising: Sandoval had 5,743,542 votes to Wright\u2019s 4,133,380. Collins said he was disappointed when he heard the final tally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to do a better job making sure our fans want to come and see us,\u201d said Collins, who extended congratulations to Sandoval and the Giants fans. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to start winning more games so we don\u2019t have this happen.\u201d\n\nWright said he was honored to be picked as a reserve, even more so because he failed to make the team last season.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go last year, and you miss that,\u201d said Wright, who began the day second in the majors with a .355 batting average. \u201cYou get a chance to be around Hall of Famers, perennial All-Stars, and it\u2019s a great time.\u201d\n\nAmong those perennial All-Stars will be Jeter, who was voted as a starter this season for the seventh consecutive time. The appearance will be his 13th over all.\n\nCano, who has 20 home runs, will be making his fourth All-Star appearance. Granderson, who has 23 homers, will go for the third time. Sabathia, who is on the disabled list with a muscle strain in his leg, said that he would make the trip to Kansas City but would not be able to play. The appearance will be his sixth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool,\u201d Granderson said of the large contingent of Yankees. \u201cRobinson\u2019s definitely having a phenomenal season. Jeter, with the start that he\u2019s had and obviously being the person he is, you can\u2019t help but vote him in.\u201d\n\nDickey is on the opposite end of the spectrum, an All-Star neophyte at 37. In June, Dickey was 5-0 with a 0.93 earned run average. He became the third Mets pitcher to have 12 wins before the break.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something to be shared,\u201d Dickey said of the honor. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor for every person that\u2019s ever poured into me and helped me along the way and for every fan that believed that special things can happen if you apply yourself.\u201d\n\nDickey\u2019s selection raised the obvious question of who may have the difficult task of catching for him. Dickey is a candidate to start the game, in which case he would be pitching to Buster Posey of the Giants.\n\nMets catcher Josh Thole said he missed the ball completely the first couple of times Dickey threw to him.\n\n\u201cI know that these guys are great athletes,\u201d Dickey said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Buster catch. I\u2019m going to bring a big knuckleball mitt with me, so we\u2019ll at least have that.\u201d\n\nWhether he starts the game or pitches in relief \u2014 the starters will be announced next week \u2014 Dickey, whose season has become one of baseball\u2019s compelling narratives, will surely be one of the game\u2019s prime attractions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an amazing story,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI would say this would be a great ending to a terrific story, but I think this is just the beginning. I think the Dickey book, Volume 2, should be due out here soon.\u201d\n\nTerry Collins said Sunday that Jason Bay (concussion) would run and hit off a tee under the observation of the Mets\u2019 medical staff Monday in New York. \u2026 Frank Francisco (oblique) was expected to begin playing catch on Monday.",

    "text": "If you read the complaint in the Don Chu case, a couple of things jump out at you. One is how modestly Chu was paid, for someone conspiring with hedge funds to reap a fortune from inside information:\n\nThe Firm pays CHU $6,000.00 per month and covers his expenses.\n\nAnother is how obvious \u2014 you might even say ingenuous \u2014 Chu\u2019s dissemination of inside information seems to be:\n\nOn or about June 19, 2009, at approximately 6:52 a.m., CHU sent Lee an email message. The subject line of the email message stated: \u201cJust in\u2026\u201d The message stated: \u201cATHR [Atheros]: Q2 [second quarter] better than expected, over 105M. GM [gross margins] ok. Q3 [third quarter] internal target at 123M [million dollars], guidance pending ?115 [million dollars] or so? will be aggressive in the pc/nb [personal computer/notebook] ASP [average sales price] to stop competitors. Hopes to maintain GM on (1) Nintendo shipment back in and (2) new 65 nm 11n chip[.] Q4 [fourth quarter] likely has GM under pressure with ASP expected even bloodier. Have fun!\u201d From my involvement in this investigation, including my discussions with Lee, my review of publicly available reports, and my training and experience, I believe that CHU in this email was providing Inside Information about Atheros. I also know that the kind of information being disclosed in this message, including revenue and gross margin information, is not publicly disclosed prior to announcements by the company. I believe that, at the time of this email message, Atheros had not yet reported results for its fiscal quarter ending in June 2009 (or, \u201cQ2\u2033), and that it was expected to do so after the close of the market on July 21, 2009. I have also reviewed CHU\u2019s cellular call data, and I have learned that on or about June 18, 2009, at approximately 7:35 a.m, there was a 2-minute call between CHU and a person utilizing a Taiwanese telephone number.\n\nThis is dense stuff, but basically, if you take this at face value, Chu called Taiwan on June 18, and got a bunch of inside information about Atheros\u2019s second quarter. He then emailed Lee \u2014 that\u2019ll be CB Lee, a cooperating witness who worked at a hedge fund at the time and who once worked for SAC Capital \u2014 on June 19 with the information. The actual second-quarter results were then released on June 21.\n\nBut here\u2019s where things get weird: if you look at the highly detailed four-page press release announcing Chu\u2019s arrest, there\u2019s no mention of the email from Chu to Lee. Instead, the release concentrates on what would seem to be a much weaker part of the case against Chu \u2014 a conversation between Lee and another insider. Inside information does seem to have been imparted to Lee on that call, but not by Chu, who wasn\u2019t on the call.\n\nAnd while there is evidence that Chu knew he was dealing in inside information, there\u2019s also evidence that Chu was careful to try to find untraceable methods to impart that information. Which stands in stark contrast to the idea that he would simply plop lots of inside information into an email and send it to Lee, more than 24 hours after getting the information from Taiwan.\n\nIn other words, the case against Chu seems a little tenuous to me \u2014 it seems like he was a relatively low-level intermediary who would put insiders in contact with traders, and who thought, probably correctly, that what he was doing was legally dubious. Why was it so important that he be arrested before he left for Taiwan, especially since he seems to have been quite happy to talk to the FBI last Sunday?\n\nMy guess is that Chu refused to become a cooperating witness on Sunday, or to admit that he brokered inside information to anybody except Lee. But investigators want him to finger other traders, so they arrested him in an attempt to up the stakes, charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He could try to fight the charges, but his chances probably aren\u2019t that good, and he also probably can\u2019t afford a good lawyer.\n\nChu\u2019s small fry: you don\u2019t tend to find white-collar criminal masterminds living in Somerset, New Jersey. Investigators want him in the US, helping them with their inquiries. But ultimately, as far as the government is concerned, his arrest is a means to an end, rather than an end in itself.",

    "text": "The ladder jump was not quite working.\n\nAs he began a fierce song in which his character determines not to mourn a life-altering rejection, Daniel N. Durant, an actor in the new Broadway revival of \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d leapt off a rung onto the stage. The goal, as conceived by the director and choreographer, was that he would land just as other members of the cast, externalizing the turmoil expressed in the song \u201cDon\u2019t Do Sadness,\u201d would knock over chairs.\n\nThe coordination between movement and music was easy for many of the actors \u2014 in a pause between \u201cYou just sail away\u201d and \u201c \u2019Cause you know,\u201d furniture would fly. But Mr. Durant, a 25-year-old deaf actor signing in the spotlight, cannot hear musical cues, and on more than one occasion he missed it.\n\nThe solution: Alex Boniello, a musician who provides the voice for Mr. Durant\u2019s character, would thrust an arm in the air. To the audience, it would be essentially invisible, lost in the frenetic stage action, but to Mr. Durant, it would be the signal. Jump.\n\nTreshelle Edmond, one of the deaf actors in the Broadway musical, talks about her journey to the stage.\n\nStaging a Broadway show is always a three-dimensional chess game. But this \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d which uses eight deaf actors, eight hearing actors and seven onstage musicians, has added another layer of complexity and sparked a burst of theatrical innovation.\n\nMusicals, after all, are built around sound, and ordinarily it is a beat, a lyric or a spoken phrase that signals to an actor when to walk on or walk off, when to begin a speech or a song, when to start a step. But for this \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d the director Michael Arden, the choreographer Spencer Liff and the actors themselves have devised an array of silent cues: hidden lights, coded gestures, timed touches and prompting props.\n\n\u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d a darkly tragic drama about adolescent sexuality in a repressive community, was written as a play by Frank Wedekind in 1891, and then adapted into a rock musical by Steven Sater and Duncan Sheik in 2006. The adaptation was a hit on Broadway \u2014 it won eight Tony awards, including for best new musical, provided starmaking roles to Lea Michele (\u201cGlee\u201d), Jonathan Groff (\u201cHamilton\u201d) and John Gallagher Jr. (\u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d), and ran for just over two years.\n\nMr. Arden, who has been collaborating with the Los Angeles troupe Deaf West Theater since appearing in their Broadway revival of \u201cBig River\u201d in 2003, thought that \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d which he viewed as \u201ca cautionary tale about the perils of miscommunication,\u201d would have great resonance with a deaf cast. Both \u201cBig River\u201d and this \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d had two productions in Los Angeles before transferring to Broadway.\n\nWithout altering the Sater-Sheik book or lyrics, Mr. Arden has added a new context for the story. The deaf actors portray deaf students in a school that does not allow the use of sign language, implicitly nodding to a historical event (contemporaneous with the play\u2019s setting in late 19th-century Germany) in which an international conference of educators called for the mandatory and exclusive use of oralism (lip reading and speech) when teaching deaf students.\n\nIn one scene, a teacher, played by Patrick Page, can be seen threatening students who use sign language, attempting to train the deaf to speak by having them feel, and then mimic, the movement of his mouth and throat, and by having them watch the impact of vocalizations on a feather held in front of the face.\n\nIn this \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d which opened to good reviews on Sept. 27, the deaf actors are at the center: Mr. Arden has asked the cast, and is now expecting audiences, to focus attention on the signing, not the singing. The deaf actors are often downstage and lighted from the front; their hearing partners are generally lighted from behind, and in ensemble numbers the cast members look toward the signers.\n\n\u201cIt is highly important that the performance is the deaf actors\u2019, and the hearing actors are following their intention \u2014 we get in trouble if we get ahead of them,\u201d said the actress Camryn Manheim, a onetime sign language interpreter who is making her Broadway debut playing several adult women in the show.\n\nMs. Manheim, like the other hearing actors, has found ways to prompt deaf actors in her scenes; for example, at one point she opens a letter to indicate to Sandra Mae Frank, a deaf actress playing her daughter, that it is time for her to start signing.\n\n\u201cIt is remarkable what they have built into the show, without your knowledge, to give people cues \u2014 all the hearing actors are doing double duty, giving cues that are cleverly woven into the show,\u201d she said.\n\nThe devices used are myriad. The stage manager, T. J. Kearney, has installed red lights on the balcony rail, blue lights at stage entrances, and a white light in a trapdoor, all to alert deaf actors; during rehearsals, a large flashing light was used whenever the director called \u201cHold!\u201d Key messages from the creative team (\u201cCast to stage\u201d) are closed-captioned on video screens in dressing rooms.\n\nAt one moment of the show, in which a group of actors forms a shiplike cluster and carries an actor across the stage, the hearing actors use their hands as metronomes, squeezing the shoulders of the deaf actors to synchronize the forward motion with the musical beat.\n\n\u201cIt can be a blink of an eye, a shrug of a shoulder, a tap of a leg \u2014 little ways we all know what we need to know,\u201d said Treshelle Edmond, a deaf actress who is making her Broadway debut as Martha, a schoolgirl who is abused by her father. Ms. Edmond said that not only did she study the mouth movements of the actress, Kathryn Gallagher, who sings and speaks for her character, but she also spent time holding Ms. Gallagher\u2019s guitar as it was played, learning from vibration to understand her songs\u2019 rhythm.\n\nJoshua Castille, who plays a student named Ernst, said he and other deaf cast members tried to better understand the role of music in the play by gathering around portable speakers in a shared apartment \u201cto feel the moments.\u201d He said similar senses were used in the staging; for example, he said, in one scene a group of deaf actors gathers around a piano, feeling its vibration and using that as a cue to emerge from a crouch.\n\nIt is not just movement and sound that need to be coordinated. Language, too, proved challenging, because the show unfolds not only in English, but also in American Sign Language, and the creative team, including three A.S.L. masters, an A.S.L. consultant and a deaf associate choreographer, Alexandria Wailes, was determined that the signing mirror the spoken English in timing, meaning and, to the extent possible, style.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge is that A.S.L. is not a very abstract language \u2014 it\u2019s more concrete, it\u2019s visual and spatial,\u201d said Shoshannah Stern, one of the A.S.L. masters. Noting that the show\u2019s lyrics are poetic and metaphor laden (a sample lyric, alluding to adolescent sexual behavior: \u201cMares will neigh with stallions that they mate/Foals they\u2019ve borne/And all shall know the wonder of purple summer\u201d), she said the sign language team had tried to create \u201cthe equivalent visual landscape\u201d while still being clear for deaf audience members.\n\nClarity of communication has guided production decisions, affecting costumes (certain shades and patterns were rejected because they were thought to create \u201cvisual noise\u201d) and choreography (hand movement is primarily for language, not just aesthetics, and, for obvious reasons, signers need to face the audience). During rehearsals, the A.S.L. masters coached actors on expressiveness and negotiated with choreographers (for example, they insisted on limiting how far fingers could extend from the head when actors made the sign for \u201cdream\u201d) while interpreters relayed stage directions and translated conversations back and forth (\u201cPatrick, Daniel wants you to know there\u2019s no way you can hurt his ears by screaming into them\u201d).\n\nAt the start of each show, actors use printed signs to inform the audience to turn off their cellphones, and to point out emergency exits. During the show, when two deaf actors are signing (and there is no sound) or two hearing actors are speaking (and there are no signs), supertitles are employed, projected either onto a chalkboard or the back wall of the stage. At many performances, deaf members of the audience can be seen applauding by raising their hands and twisting their wrists.\n\nThe revival\u2019s cast includes the nation\u2019s best-known deaf actress \u2014 Marlee Matlin, who won an Academy Award in 1987 for \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d \u2014 and its A.S.L. consultant is a matriarch of contemporary American deaf theater: Linda Bove, who introduced a generation of children to sign language with her long-running role as Linda the Librarian on \u201cSesame Street.\u201d\n\nBut most of the cast members have never appeared on Broadway before, and several said they had never even seen a Broadway show; Ms. Matlin has been using Twitter to encourage other productions, including \u201cHamilton\u201d and this fall\u2019s \u201cMisery,\u201d to host interpreted performances that the \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d cast might attend.\n\nLike Ms. Manheim, who learned A.S.L. to satisfy a language requirement for college after failing French and Spanish, some of the other hearing members of the cast knew sign language already \u2014 most strikingly Austin P. McKenzie, who learned it as a counselor at a summer camp for children and adults with special needs, and who pulls off the complicated feat of singing and signing simultaneously in the show\u2019s lead role, Melchior.\n\nBut many of the hearing actors knew no sign language, and many of the deaf actors had no relationship with music.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the role in a musical, I imagined myself not even being able to do this \u2014 I hadn\u2019t any prior experience with music,\u201d said Mr. Durant, who plays the troubled adolescent Moritz.\n\n\u201cIt was not smooth sailing initially,\u201d he added. \u201cIt took practice and rehearsal. And I\u2019ve learned so much more about music and rhythm and timing, and feeling the power of expressing yourself, and I love it.\u201d",

    "text": "BAGHDAD (AP) \u0097 Iraq's foreign minister insisted Sunday that any security deal with the United States must contain a \"very clear timeline\" for the departure of U.S. troops. A suicide bomber struck north of Baghdad, killing at least five people including an American soldier.\n\nForeign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told reporters that American and Iraqi negotiators were \"very close\" to reaching a long-term security agreement that will set the rules for U.S. troops in Iraq after the U.N. mandate expires at the end of the year.\n\nZebari said the Iraqis were insisting that the agreement include a \"very clear timeline\" for the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces, but he refused to talk about specific dates.\n\n\"We have said that this is a condition-driven process,\" he added, suggesting that the departure schedule could be modified if the security situation changed.\n\nBut Zebari made clear that the Iraqis would not accept a deal that lacks a timeline for the end of the U.S. military presence.\n\n\"No, no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline,\" Zebari replied when asked if the Iraqis would accept an agreement that did not mention dates.\n\nDifferences over a withdrawal timetable have become one of the most contentious issues remaining in the talks, which began early this year. U.S. and Iraqi negotiators missed a July 31 target date for completing the deal, which must be approved by Iraq's parliament.\n\nPresident Bush has steadfastly refused to accept any timetable for bringing U.S. troops home. Last month, however, Bush and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki agreed to set a \"general time horizon\" for a U.S. departure.\n\nLast week, two senior Iraqi officials told The Associated Press that American negotiators had agreement to a formula which would remove U.S. forces from Iraqi cities by June 30, 2009 with all combat troops out of the country by October 2010.\n\nThe last American support troops would leave about three years later, the Iraqis said.\n\nBut U.S. officials insist there is no agreement on specific dates. Both the American and Iraqi officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are ongoing. Iraq's Shiite-led government believes a withdrawal schedule is essential to win parliamentary approval.\n\nAmerican officials have been less optimistic because of major differences on key issues including who can authorize U.S. military operations and immunity for U.S. troops from prosecution under Iraqi law.\n\nThe White House said discussions continued on a bilateral agreement and said any timeframe discussed was due to major improvements in security over the past year.\n\n\"We are only now able to discuss conditions-based time horizons because security has improved so much. This would not have been possible 18 months ago,\" White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Sunday. \"We all look forward to the day when Iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions, allowing U.S. troops to serve in an overwatch role, and more importantly return home.\"\n\nIraq's position in the U.S. talks hardened after a series of Iraqi military successes against Shiite and Sunni extremists in Basra, Baghdad, Mosul and other major cities.\n\nViolence in Iraq has declined sharply over the past year following a U.S. troop buildup, a Sunni revolt against al-Qaeda in Iraq and a Shiite militia cease-fire.\n\nBut attacks continue, raising concern that the militants are trying to regroup.\n\nThe suicide bomber struck Sunday afternoon as U.S. and Iraqi troops were responding to a roadside bombing that wounded an Iraqi in Tarmiyah, 30 miles north of Baghdad, the U.S. military said.\n\nFour Iraqi civilians were killed along with the American soldier, military spokesman Lt. Col. Steve Stover said. Two American soldiers and an Iraqi interpreter were among 24 people wounded.\n\nNo group claimed responsibility for the blast but suicide bombings are the signature attack of al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n\n\"This was a heinous attack by al-Qaeda in Iraq against an Iraqi family, followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians, their security forces and U.S. soldiers,\" Stover said.\n\nElsewhere, a suicide car bomber attacked the Kurdish security department in Khanaqin, 90 miles northeast of Baghdad. At least two people were killed and 25 wounded, including the commander of local Kurdish forces, Lt. Col. Majid Ahmed, police said.\n\nEthnic tensions have been rising in northern Iraq amid disputes between Kurds, Turkomen and mostly Sunni Arabs over Kurdish demands to annex the oil-rich city of Kirkuk into their self-ruled region.\n\nSawarah Ghalib, 25, who was wounded in the blast, said he believed military operations underway south of the city in Diyala province had pushed insurgents into the Khanaqin area.\n\n\"I did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town,\" Ghalib said from his bed in the Khanaqin hospital. \"al-Qaeda is to blame for this attack. Operations in Diyala have pushed them here.\"\n\nIn Baghdad, six people were killed in a series of bombings on the first day of the Iraqi work week.\n\nThe deadliest blast occurred about 8:15 a.m. in a crowded area where people wait for buses in the capital's mainly Shiite southeastern district of Kamaliya. Four people were killed, including a woman and her brother, and 11 others wounded, according to police.\n\nA car bomb later exploded as an Iraqi army patrol transporting money to a state-run bank passed by in Baghdad's central Khillani square, killing two people including an Iraqi soldier and wounding nine other people, a police officer said.\n\nAnother Iraqi soldier was killed and five were wounded by a car bomb in Salman Pak, about 25 kilometers south of Baghdad, police said.\n\nCopyright 2008 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s adolescent crassness, his slurs against women and immigrant groups, and his blatant disregard for the truth are reasons aplenty to vote against him. But South Carolina voters who find the bully charming should consider this: Trump would be very bad news for the American economy.\n\nTrump has been selling himself as the candidate to bring back \u201cwinning.\u201d The first chapter of his campaign biography Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again, is titled, \u201cWinning Again,\u201d and a few paragraphs in he declaims, \u201cThis country is in big trouble. We don\u2019t win anymore. We lose to China. We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s his campaign\u2019s economic theme. America has been \u201closing\u201d by letting in immigrants and allowing free trade. Trump would reclaim our tradition of \u201cwinning.\u201d But Trump has an outmoded view of economics that was never true and is particularly false now.\n\nIt is true in a casino, where Donald Trump\u2019s understanding of economics began, and perhaps ended. A casino is a perfect zero-sum economy. If you win, the house loses. Much more often, your loss is the house\u2019s win.\n\nThat\u2019s because a casino is not productive (aside from its employment of a few low-wage workers). Its only activity is gambling. Someone\u2019s win is another party\u2019s loss.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, Trump\u2019s other occasional successes, in commercial real estate, have a history of relying on government tax abatements and other breaks. That\u2019s another forum for zero-sum, win-lose economics. One mogul dodges a tax; many ordinary citizens have to pay a little more.\n\nBut in the mainstream economy where most Americans work, economics is not zero-sum. Each transaction enriches both sides. When you buy an automobile it enriches the dealer, the manufacturer, the bank that provided financing, the suppliers who contributed parts\u2014an entire web of affiliated parties. You, the consumer, also benefit\u2014because you value the automobile.\n\nIn the Trump view of the world, one of those parties\u2014say, the car company\u2014\u201cwins\u201d and everyone else loses. In fact, every one of those parties wins, or rather benefits, to a small degree. And their increased prosperity marginally increases their propensity to spend and notches up growth for all.\n\nThe new high-tech and health-care economies are redolent with examples of firms whose success, rather than \u201ctaking\u201d from others, has sprouted entire subcultures of spinoff companies. One successful enterprise leads to another. (Think of the iPhone and the gaggle of app developers founded in its wake.)\n\nAlthough not every industry spawns such a virtuous circle, in a free economy every participant gains, to a small degree, from every trade. And that is true even for the foreign \u201ctrade\u201d that Trump routinely disparages.\n\nAs Trump might have learned had he paid attention as a student at Wharton, trade bestows the benefits of \u201ccomparative advantage.\u201d Let\u2019s say your neighbor is a doctor and you are a carpenter. You would be foolish to diagnose your children\u2019s illnesses, and your neighbor would be foolish to build his own bookcase.\n\nThe same holds true for nations: each has different comparative advantages. While this may be hard to visualize on a global scale, it is easy to see on a local level. If a political xenophobe, say in Massachusetts, chose to restrict trade with Connecticut, or to build a wall on the border with Vermont, or to keep local companies from hiring workers from Rhode Island, the Bay State would become, over time, a lot poorer. The same is true for the U.S. in the global economy.\n\nOver the past twenty-five years, and in contrast to Trump\u2019s repeated alarums, U.S. exports have soared from $535 billion to $2.23 trillion. In 1990 exports accounted for less than 9% of the GDP. Now they are 13.5%. Our trade partners have benefitted but so have we\u2014from imports as well as from exports.\n\nTrump says he wants to take jobs \u201cback\u201d from China. But jobs in a world economy stimulate each other. A prosperous China is good for America, no less than a prosperous Vermont benefits Massachusetts. (Notice: our stock market didn\u2019t rise on word of China\u2019s recent troubles\u2014it sank.)\n\nTrump has frequently fulminated about the fact that Mexico is making automobiles. Recently, on CNN, he spliced in a bit of nativism: \u201cIf they [the Ford Motor Co] go there \u2026 the next thing you know they have the illegals driving right across the border.\u201d Trump loves to imply that the U.S. is besieged with unauthorized Mexicans. Actually, there are 1 million fewer unauthorized Mexicans living in the U.S. than a decade ago. But those that remain here contribute both to the economy and to the tax base\u2014via Social Security.\n\nTrump also told CNN that, while in Los Angeles, he \u201csaw\u201d ships coming in from Japan, \u201cloaded up with cars, thousands of cars. \u2026You know [what] we send them? Beef. And they don\u2019t want it. And we send them wheat; they don\u2019t want it.\u201d The notion that U.S. exports tend to be less valuable, or support only low-paying jobs, is another Trump canard\u2014\u201ca total lie,\u201d as the Donald might say. Our five biggest exports to Japan are aircraft, medical and technical equipment, machinery, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. (As a trade analyst Trump is living in another century. Wheat accounts for one half of one percent of American goods exports.)\n\nTrump\u2019s slogan\u2014\u201cmaking America great again\u201d\u2014borrows from the Republican demigod, Ronald Reagan. But Reagan projected a fearless optimism and generally tried to open the economy. Trump wants to close the economy. He represents not the economics of hope but the economics of fear. We can only win if our neighbors lose. That\u2019s the sort of narrow, desperate protectionism that, in the 1930s, helped to fuel a world depression.\n\nTrump\u2019s vulgarities and Big Lie deceptions should, alone, disqualify him for the presidency. To cite only one very low example, his claim that he saw \u201cthousands\u201d of American Muslims cheering on the day that the Twin Towers went down is a blood libel, intended to whip up fear against a minority.\n\nFar from bringing America back, Trump, with his disdain for facts and readiness to stir up xenophobia, represents everything that is un-American. But if that\u2019s not enough, there is this: Donald Trump has as much chance of reviving the economy as you do of drawing a jackpot on a slot machine. Not unlike his politics, his economics are based on fear and lies. His way leads to impoverishment not just spiritually, but materially too.",

    "text": "PAPER IS BACK After years of seemingly unstoppable growth, e-book sales have started to slip, while paper has improbably bounced back. Digital book sales fell nearly 10 percent in 2015 from the previous year. Paperback sales grew by a healthy 16 percent, according to the Association of American Publishers, which tracks sales from more than 1,200 publishers.\n\nGRAY DIGITAL Those who came of age with digital technology seem, surprisingly, to prefer paper to pixels. Young readers are less drawn to e-books. Only 13 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds primarily read e-books these days, compared with nearly 30 percent of 55- to 64-year-olds, according to a recent survey of 4,992 book buyers conducted by the Codex Group, a publishing consultancy.\n\nREAD IT ON THE PHONE Last year 15 percent of e-book buyers read their books primarily on smartphones, up from 6 percent in 2013, according to a survey of 6,000 people by Nielsen Books & Consumers. In that same period, Amazon\u2019s dedicated e-reader, Kindle, seems to have fallen in popularity: 21 percent of e-book buyers said they read on Kindle e-readers in 2015, compared with 30 percent in 2013.\n\nDOWNLOAD AND LISTEN Sales of downloadable audiobooks have surged in recent years, vastly outpacing any other publishing format. Digital audiobook sales were up nearly 40 percent in 2015 over the previous year, according to the Association of American Publishers.\n\nTHE \u2018HUNGER GAMES\u2019 FACTOR The steepest drop in e-book sales was concentrated in children\u2019s and young-adult books, where digital sales fell by 43 percent last year, probably because there wasn\u2019t a blockbuster crossover young-adult novel series like \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d which attracted millions of adult readers.\n\nCOLORING BOOKS! The huge coloring book surge continues as millions of adults pick up crayons to unwind. Some 12 million coloring books were sold in the United States last year, up from one million in 2014, and more than 2,000 coloring book titles were published, compared with just 300 the previous year, according to Nielsen. There are coloring books for every imaginable interest group, including \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cHarry Potter\u201d ones, Hillary Clinton and Donald J.

    "text": "One day last summer, Ann and her husband, Tom, walked two and a half hours to reach Hazleton, a onetime mining town in eastern Pennsylvania. They had lived there until July, when they were evicted and moved in with Ann\u2019s mother in Sugarloaf, a more affluent township nearby. There was not much to miss about Hazleton, with its decaying downtown and its fading homes spotted with satellite dishes, but to Ann and Tom the town held a shimmering appeal: It had heroin, a lot of it. They had called the usual friends for a ride, with no luck, and their own car had been repossessed. So at midday, the two left Ann\u2019s mother\u2019s condominium by foot and followed the asphalt out of the valley all the way to Hazleton. Eventually they turned onto Alter Street, where, especially in summer, heroin dealers greeted customers outside a packed barbershop and a busy pawnshop, clustering around them, competing for business. Sometimes Ann and Tom joined other users they knew behind a building, where someone had left a tattered couch. Sometimes they got high in an abandoned garage on a side street. Though the walk that day to Alter Street was long, it was worth it to them both: Tom, especially, loved heroin, and Ann loved Tom, and the march to Hazleton was as much about need as it was about love.\n\n\u2018He actually is a very nice guy,\u2019 Ann told the detectives about her dealer. \u2018He\u2019s just in the wrong occupation.\u2019\n\nMonths later, when downtown Hazleton\u2019s streets were lined with piles of dirty, crusty snow, Ann (who along with Tom asked that they be identified by only their middle names) thought about that walk with something like nostalgia. It wasn\u2019t the kind of nostalgia she felt for the days when she was a new mother, taking care of two small children, going to a job at a warehouse, fussing over car seats and relaxing over lunch with co-workers. That was a nostalgia for the person she had once been; this was a nostalgia for someone else \u2014 Tom \u2014 and a less lonely time.\n\nNow her husband was in jail, and she knew she needed a plan to avoid ending up there too. She tried a rehabilitation program in the fall and managed to get off heroin for 18 days, but within hours of getting out, she was holed up with a new friend she made at rehab, as high as ever. Now, at 25, she was trying a different way to save herself. She was working with the police, who had told her she was going to be charged with possession. If she wanted to stay out of jail, they told her, she would have to help them. All she had to do was set up her best dealer.\n\nOn a frigid day in early February, Ann hurried into the back seat of a red Honda waiting outside her father\u2019s small home near Hazleton. She said a quick hello to the people in front: Carol Davenport and John Brennan, longtime narcotics agents, who were taking Ann to buy heroin from someone who had sold to her many times before.\n\n\u201cHe actually is a very nice guy,\u201d Ann told Davenport and Brennan as they drove. \u201cHe\u2019s just in the wrong occupation.\u201d Unlike everyone else in her life, her dealer, whom she considered a friend, seemed to trust her: For the past month, he regularly fronted her three or four bricks of the drug worth $150 each. She could easily sell one brick \u2014 50 bags \u2014 for $200 or 10 bags at a time for $60. Either way, she could pay her dealer what she owed him and keep at least a brick for herself, which would supply her for about two days. Ann was flattered when the dealer originally approached her to suggest that they might work together, which seemed to imply a certain faith in her general competence. He was sweet, in Ann\u2019s opinion. Once, she told him that her mother might kick her out, and she half-joked that she might have to live with him. \u201cNo problem,\u201d he told her. Not that he would tell her where he lived. Not that she even knew his real name. He had moved to Hazleton from New York. She thought he was Dominican, like a lot of dealers in town. He was about her age, good-looking, with blue-black hair. He made a nice living, was professional. After they made a deal, they always hugged.\n\nDavenport twisted around from the front seat to look at Ann. \u201cIf you think this guy is a nice guy, you need to re-evaluate your idea of the quality of a good person,\u201d she said. Davenport had raised a daughter, who was about Ann\u2019s age, as a single mother. Forty-five and trim, she had long hair that fell in waves around a face that no dealer could refuse, no male dealer at least. One dealer Davenport had worked with for months wept when he realized Davenport had been gathering evidence on him. \u201cI liked you,\u201d he said when they met after he was arrested. \u201cI took care of you.\u201d\n\nAnn wore a black hoodie over a T-shirt with a hot pink sequined star and black leggings tucked into black boots. Davenport patted her down, poking around inside the fake fur of the boots, to confirm that she wasn\u2019t hiding money or drugs. She smelled of shampoo, and her eyes were carefully made up. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I want to ask you if you\u2019ve been clean,\u201d Davenport said. Ann said she\u2019d been off heroin for three days and gone through withdrawal, which she describes as \u201cthe flu times 100.\u201d Now she was even beginning to eat again: \u201cMy mom says she\u2019s starting to see the old Ann.\u201d Brennan and Davenport were not sure whether to believe her; she did not seem high, but some users were like that. Tom, who started out with prescription pills like Percocet, managed to hold down a welding job while he was using and drove a forklift under the influence; he had even been promoted twice at an Amazon warehouse. He was about to be hired full time when he failed a drug test.\n\nThe plan that day was to drive to the parking lot of a nearby convenience store called Sheetz. The police had given Ann $400 that she was to give to the dealer. She owed him that money, and she would get another two bricks to sell. \u201cHow are you going to let us know you have it?\u201d Brennan asked. She told him she would text him one word: \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nBrennan was sturdy, 57 years old, with horn-rimmed glasses that seemed at odds with the hoodie he usually wore. He put four children through Catholic school, solid kids, every one, and Ann\u2019s mother trusted him implicitly, frequently turning to him for advice about how to deal with her daughter. He spoke to Ann with the deep, confidence-inspiring voice of a successful coach.\n\nBrennan was based in Philadelphia, where he worked as a narcotics agent for the state attorney general on long-term cases \u2014 getting warrants for wires and aiming for dealers who trafficked in kilos, not bricks. He was in Hazleton as part of a 10-person task force called the Mobile Street Crimes Unit that was designed to rotate in troubled towns throughout the state. Near the intersection of I-80 and I-81, Hazleton, a town of around 30,000, has long been a convenient distribution hub for drug traffickers. In the late \u201890s, officers in Hazleton considered cocaine and crack the town\u2019s biggest problems; but about a decade ago, they started seeing an influx of heroin. The town\u2019s police force of 38 could hardly stem the tide. Hazleton had developed a reputation as a town where users from surrounding areas knew they could find heroin; Alter Street had become the kind of overt drug market linked to crime and social decay. \u201cAn open-air drug bazaar is the ultimate broken window,\u201d Mark A. R. Kleiman, a professor of public policy at U.C.L.A., says.\n\nThe Pennsylvania attorney general, Kathleen Kane, intended the task force to provide towns like Hazleton \u2014 there were easily a dozen around the state \u2014 with a temporary blitz of manpower. By locking up Ann\u2019s dealer, Davenport and Brennan knew they were probably only creating a business opportunity for someone else; but there they were anyway, trying to at least keep things from becoming worse.\n\nIn the car, Ann was cracking her knuckles, pink fingernails digging into her palms. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to know it was me,\u201d she said.\n\nOne day, her 4-year-old grandson came running into Lucy\u2019s bedroom, telling her to hurry \u2014 \u2018Mommy\u2019s shooting drugs.\u2019\n\nAnn got a text. There had been a misunderstanding; the dealer was coming all the way from Philadelphia. He said it would be an hour and a half, but that probably meant at least two, maybe more. Davenport slapped her leg in irritation: \u201cAnn \u2014 this guy exhausts me.\u201d\n\nBrennan and Davenport dropped Ann off at home and told her they would see her in an hour. Neither felt particularly hopeful about the plan, but they came back around 6 and settled in at the parking lot. The two detectives had spent more hours than they cared to consider killing time in the parking lots of dollar stores and fast-food restaurants in downtown Hazleton, waiting for deals to go down. Now they drank coffee and talked about Brennan\u2019s low-carb diet and Davenport\u2019s quinoa recipes. Texts from the dealer dribbled in. \u201cDo you want your money or not?\u201d Ann texted, impatient. \u201cYesss,\u201d he texted back. \u201cWaittt.\u201d\n\nAt 6:40, Ann went inside the Sheetz to wait, occasionally popping out into the cold air. Her phone was dying \u2014 what if she couldn\u2019t text Brennan \u201cgood\u201d? She ran back to the car to charge it, which made everyone edgy: The dealer could pull in at any minute.\n\nInside the Honda, Davenport and Brennan were fending off boredom and anxiety. Forty-five minutes went by. An hour. Brennan, staring out at the snowbank in front of them, started dreaming about summer, a coming James Taylor concert. Then he and Davenport were singing: \u201cI\u2019ve seen fire and I\u2019ve seen rain/I\u2019ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end. . . .\u201d No one mentioned it, but Taylor has said the song is about praying for deliverance from the pain of heroin withdrawal: \u201cMy body\u2019s aching and my time is at hand. . . .\u201d\n\nInside Sheetz, Ann was on the phone with her dealer. He was telling her he was in the parking lot, but she couldn\u2019t see him or his white van. In the middle of this confusion, Ann\u2019s phone died. In a panic, she asked to use the store phone, dialed three, four, five times. Finally the dealer picked up. He was at the wrong Sheetz, about 15 minutes away. He said he would come to the right one soon.\n\nHearing his voice unnerved her. For the first time that day, Ann was tempted to try to abort the plan. It was hard to betray a friend \u2014 hard, also, to commit to cutting herself off from a steady supply of heroin. She could tell Brennan and Davenport that he had called to say he wasn\u2019t coming, and they would all go home. But there was that problem of the $400 she owed him. She was broke.\n\nShe ran to the Honda to update them, then ran back. And finally there he was, in a baseball jacket, with that blue-black hair, driving a white van. Ann got in, and they drove up a street near her dad\u2019s house to make the exchange, the way they always did. The deal was a blur: She had bought from him dozens of times but never felt this nervous. When they pulled back into the parking lot, Ann hugged him goodbye and got out of the van. She didn\u2019t even have time to text \u201cgood\u201d before she realized what was going on.\n\n\u201cPolice! Don\u2019t move!\u201d she heard men yelling. There were 10 officers surrounding the van, their handguns drawn. Ann took a step, and no one stopped her, so she kept moving. If she looked back, she would have seen the dealer splayed on the ground. Go to John\u2019s car, go to John\u2019s car, she thought, willing herself toward Brennan\u2019s Honda. She threw herself into the back seat, breathing heavily, and rested her head on the headrest.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do it like that?\u201d she said. Ann had not asked for or been given too many details that day, but she assumed the police would arrest the dealer some time later, so her involvement would not be apparent.\n\n\u201cWe had to, Ann,\u201d Brennan said. Just a few days earlier, another agent saw Ann getting into a car with the dealer without alerting them. They had no reason, really, to trust her, and she didn\u2019t know how much to trust them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel good,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m shook. I got scared \u2014 they were coming right at me.\u201d But it was worse than that: Her dealer had to know she set him up; it was obvious, he knew, he knew, he knew.\n\n\u201cYou did good,\u201d Brennan told her. \u201cJust relax \u2014 you don\u2019t have to worry. And now you can\u2019t get dope.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be done. I want to be over with it.\u201d The ride back to Ann\u2019s mother\u2019s home was quiet. Davenport suggested she find herself a new set of friends, make a clean break. \u201cYou did a good job,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cHere\u2019s $50, O.K.?\u201d He stopped her before she got out of the car. \u201cAnd, Ann \u2014 stay off that stuff.\u201d\n\nWhen it was all over, Ann walked into her mother\u2019s apartment, a small two-bedroom intended for an empty-nester, now packed with Ann\u2019s belongings, her children\u2019s toys. She explained to her mother, Lucy, how the evening unfolded, and Lucy focused on the aspects of the story she considered hopeful: Maybe this was the beginning of the end of it all \u2014 the late-night phone calls, the strange cars pulling up to her condominium.\n\nFor a long time, Lucy (her middle name), a medical technician, managed to ignore the signs that her daughter was using heroin. When Ann started asking for money about a year and a half ago, Lucy assumed it was Tom who was blowing their income on drugs \u2014 Tom, who always had that empty look in his eyes, who once nodded off right in the middle of one of the big Sunday-night family dinners Lucy used to host. If Ann and Tom\u2019s apartment was suddenly disheveled, and the kids looked a little ill kept, that was only because Ann was exhausted, Lucy told herself. By the time she was 24, Ann had two children and was working the 11-to-7 night shift at the Hershey plant, getting by on almost no sleep during the day. She knew Ann was not perfect \u2014 she could have a mouth on her, was never much for schoolwork \u2014 but this was the girl she\u2019d accompanied to Girl Scouts and watched play field hockey. When Lucy and her husband divorced, Ann, who was 18, chose to live with Lucy. The two were like girlfriends.\n\nIt all came out in the fall. Tom, who had been charged with possession, went to jail. But even after he left, Lucy found syringes around the house and demanded that Ann show her arms. She knew then that Ann was shooting up, but it still took time for Lucy to appreciate just how far gone her daughter was. One day, her 4-year-old grandson came running into Lucy\u2019s bedroom, telling her to hurry \u2014 \u201cMommy\u2019s shooting drugs.\u201d Lucy found her daughter in the living room, needle in hand. Not long before that, Lucy realized that her gold jewelry was missing: her grandmother\u2019s rings, the diamond pendant a young man had given her just before leaving for Vietnam. Only Ann would have known where to find all those velvet boxes.\n\nLucy went round and round in her head about what had gone wrong. She had done everything for her daughter, from buying every Barbie she wanted as a girl to co-signing a car loan when she was grown. Maybe that was it \u2014 maybe Lucy had done too much, spoiled her.\n\nNow she was simultaneously housing her daughter and trying as hard as she could to put her in jail. At least in jail, Lucy believed, she would get clean. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you just put her somewhere where she couldn\u2019t get drugs for like a year?\u201d Lucy once asked Brennan.\n\n\u201cLike kidnap her?\u201d Brennan told her. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\n\nAnn sometimes accused her mother of plotting to get control of her grandchildren. \u201cYou think I wanted to be raising two toddlers at 63?\u201d Lucy would respond. \u201cYou think that was my plan?\u201d But Lucy was grateful for the grandchildren: If she had nothing to do but worry about Ann, she would have collapsed from all the strain.\n\nNot long after Brennan and Davenport dropped Ann off, they called her again: They needed to deal with some paperwork about the $50 Brennan had given her. When the car pulled into her mother\u2019s parking lot she noticed another police car behind it and felt uneasy.\n\nShe went outside. Brennan told her to get in the car. He asked her to show him the $50, then grabbed it out of her hand. \u201cWhere\u2019s the money?\u201d he wanted to know. \u201cWhere\u2019s the $400, Ann?\u201d Brennan, gentle Brennan, was cursing at her, his coach\u2019s voice booming. When they searched the dealer, they didn\u2019t find the $400, and he claimed Ann never gave it to him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take it,\u201d she said. \u201cI swear on my life \u2014 I swear on my kids!\u201d A cop she didn\u2019t know handcuffed her in the back of the car; someone told her she was being charged with theft. She turned to Davenport: Didn\u2019t she believe her? \u201cI want to believe you,\u201d Davenport told her. \u201cBut I get lied to every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m a junkie,\u201d Ann said to Brennan, wildly, a self-description that pained even him to hear. \u201cI know I\u2019m a junkie \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Brennan and other officers went inside the house and tore through a pile of shopping bags and hampers where Ann was storing her clothing. As he tipped up a couch, Ann\u2019s young son tried to help, putting all his weight behind it. Lucy, exhausted, in pajamas and glasses, shook her head. \u201cJust lock her up, John,\u201d she told him.\n\nFor the first time that day, Ann was tempted to try to abort the plan. It was hard to betray a friend \u2014 hard, also, to commit to cutting herself off from a steady supply of heroin.\n\nBrennan did not find any money. And Ann could not have left and bought drugs already, that much seemed clear. Then a call came in: Someone had searched the dealer one more time. The $400 was in his coat pocket all along.\n\nBrennan, stricken, looked at Ann. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry,\u201d he told her. The handcuffs were off by then, and Ann started to cry.\n\nAs February wore on, Brennan started to feel tired of the snow, of the small-town desperation, of the sense that no matter how many dealers they locked up, others would take their place. He expected the endless supply and demand in Philadelphia but not in a town of Hazleton\u2019s size.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration considers prescription-drug abuse, not heroin, to be the country\u2019s fastest-growing drug problem: 2.4 million Americans used prescription drugs nonmedically for the first time in 2012, according to the most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Many of those people abuse opiates like OxyContin and Percocet. Some small percentage of them, unable to afford expensive pills or finding their tolerance too high for those drugs, seek out heroin as a cheap, potent fix. Increasingly they find it with some ease. For all the billions the U.S. government has spent fighting drug trafficking over the years, Mexican gangs have been flooding the market. The resulting competition among dealers has made heroin cheaper and purer than it ever has been. From 2007 to 2012, the number of people who reported using heroin in the previous year grew to 669,000 from 373,000, a statistic that represents a tiny percentage of the population but a significant rate of increase.\n\nOne week after Davenport and Brennan arrested Ann\u2019s dealer, Attorney General Kane arrived in Hazleton to oversee the last days of the mobile unit\u2019s work there. A few dozen extra officers were brought in, and about 30 small-time dealers and users were rounded up over three days, in addition to the 90 or so who were arrested over the preceding six months. That Wednesday, the attorney general held a news conference to talk about the unit\u2019s success. \u201cI will tell you that this Mobile Street Crimes Unit is about street fighting,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a street fighter. . . . That\u2019s what we do \u2014 we are down on the ground. . . . We\u2019re not think-tanking. We\u2019re not talking about concepts. We are out on the streets, on raids.\u201d\n\nBut David Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, questions the approach of these sorts of task forces. \u201cThe people on the ground are doing the best they can do. But the level of effort is never remotely equal to the work that remains to be done. If they stayed there forever, it wouldn\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nAn agent for the special-operations group, brought in to help with the roundup, cheerfully accepted the futility that he understood to be an integral part of his job. \u201cThis,\u201d he told me, gesturing at the 50 or so officers there to help clean up the town, \u201cis a Band-Aid on a gaping wound.\u201d\n\nBy Friday, most members of the task force, including Brennan, had returned to their own corners of the state. The drug trade on Alter Street had at least temporarily quieted, no small step for a town trying to dispel its reputation as a drug hub, but Ann had no problem finding heroin elsewhere in town. She was still using despite what she told Davenport and Brennan. That night, she was inside a Giant Food Store, reveling in the privacy of its bathroom. It was big and bright, a cathedral of a space, where she could comfortably kneel down and find peace. The chain stores in Hazleton \u2014 Giant, Turkey Hill, Rite Aid \u2014 all represented refuge to Ann.\n\nRight out of high school, Ann fell in love with cocaine, which she snorted on lost weekends in the Poconos with friends. But she stopped cold when she became pregnant at 20. For years, she was good, as she put it \u2014 a good girl, a good mother \u2014 everyone said so, even her mother\u2019s friends. But then a friend of Tom\u2019s persuaded him to try heroin, and their family life changed \u2014 suddenly, he was gone, either out with his friends getting high or home but stoned out of reach. Ann was lonely and tired and more than a little bored: Night after night, at the Hershey factory, she placed little wafers in little molds \u2014 God, she hated Kit Kats. Her lunch break came in the early-morning hours. A co-worker started offering her cocaine. At first she resisted \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a mommy, I spend time with my kids,\u201d she told him \u2014 but she had not forgotten how cocaine once made her feel. Finally she took him up on his offer.\n\nIt was easy, then, to move to heroin, to share with Tom, after the kids went to bed, that rare euphoria: \u201cOur time,\u201d they called it. At first, Ann only sniffed the drug; Tom refused to shoot Ann up, afraid of where the needle would take her. But soon she could no longer feel the effects of the heroin she snorted, and she eventually figured out how to shoot up.\n\nIn the bathroom of the Giant Food, she went to work. Out of a floral makeup bag, from underneath a mound of compacts and mascara, she pulled out a bright orange stretchy headband, a medicine bottle, three small glassine envelopes and a single Q-tip, which she would use as a filter. \u201cMy mother got rid of my cotton balls,\u201d she said \u2014 Lucy knew what she used them for. Ann gently poured the contents of the bags, a pale powder, into the cap of the medicine bottle. She pulled water from a plastic bottle into her syringe, then ejected it into the heroin and stirred. Gripping the syringe in her mouth, she ripped off a tiny bit of the Q-tip. She placed it in the cap, where it soaked up the solution, and then she dipped the needle into its cottony softness. She extracted the drug, leaving a brown ring around the interior of the bottle top.\n\nShe took off her hoodie, pushed up the sleeve of her shirt and knelt down. She wrapped the orange headband three times around her arm until it was tight. She massaged a vein on her left arm, gently, as if to coax its cooperation. Then the needle went in, slowly. She failed to connect with a vein, tried again, failed again: Scar tissue was probably starting to get in the way. In and out, in and out. She breathed audibly, sometimes twirling the syringe. A small, dark stream of blood congealed on the pale underside of her arm.\n\nA knock on the door. \u201cIs there someone in there?\u201d Ann did not look up. \u201cJust a minute,\u201d she said. Her concentration was complete. Five minutes went by; she switched arms, switched again. \u201cHere\u2019s one,\u201d she said tenderly, setting her sights on a faint blue, slender line beside the main one in her arm. Finally: \u201cThere you go,\u201d she said. She sat motionless for a moment.\n\nAnn always described it the same way \u2014 first, a feeling in the back of her throat, then the rush, that cosseting, warm feeling barreling its way through her blood.\n\nShe cleaned up, marking her syringe with eyeliner so she would know that it had been used. She put her jacket back on, washed her hands, checked her face in the mirror. Three bags was not necessarily so much that she would nod off, falling into the semisleep of addicts who can hang and sway even when standing; it was just enough to get her right in some way. In its comfort, she seemed to find new strength to imagine giving up the drug, especially since it took her so long to hit a vein. \u201cI can\u2019t hit anything,\u201d she said, as she wiped the blood off her arm with a fresh piece of toilet paper. \u201cIt must be God saying, \u2018Quit.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnn talked about quitting all the time. She imagined herself going to school \u2014 maybe taking some classes in criminal justice, a subject she thought about pursuing after high school. For several days, Ann had been carrying around with her a single pill \u2014 her sub, she called it, short for Suboxone. Suboxone, like methadone, is a drug that is dispensed to help ease the symptoms of withdrawal. Unlike methadone, Suboxone can be administered outside a clinic by prescription. For all the concern about crime in Hazleton, the town had never been able to muster enough support for a methadone clinic, one of the few measures proven to reduce criminal activity among drug users. And Ann said the waiting lists at the local doctors who prescribed Suboxone were three to four months long.\n\nOne Suboxone seemed unlikely to get Ann anywhere close to full recovery. Even on the other side of withdrawal, the satisfactions of a sober, adult life might prove elusive. Recovering addicts report a kind of emotional dullness that can linger for months, even years, a result of compensatory changes in the brain that only slowly reverse. Downregulated by overstimulation, the reward system for the ordinary pleasures in life limps along, an unreliable, rusted-out machine; the stress system, by contrast, works in overdrive, with a ruthless, hair-trigger sensitivity. Even after they have not touched drugs for a year, addicts, studies find, are more sensitive to hot and cold. And amid all that psychic ache, one memory shines exceptionally bright: That unnaturally exquisite reward.\n\nStill, Ann carried around the Suboxone pill, almost as a totem of possibility. She even showed it to her mother, as proof that she really was going to stop.\n\nBy Monday, Ann was hurting. She had no money, and she had exhausted any favors her friends owed her. She had no drugs to sell, no buying power. She knew it was stupid, but she kept calling her dealer, whom she heard was out on bail, her need so strong she could not heed her own common sense. He never called back.\n\nAt 3 that afternoon, Ann was working the phone outside a convenience store, texting and calling around town for help. She said she had not used since the day before; and now she was starting to feel those first symptoms of withdrawal: hot, cold, hot, cold. She was sighing, over and over again. She was trying to make something work. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said to someone who had just turned her down. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a trader?\u201d All she had to offer was Seroquel, an anti-psychotic, that she said was given to addicts in withdrawal to help them sleep.\n\nShe called someone else \u2014 voice mail. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I get ahold of anyone?\u201d she said. Her voice was small. \u201cI\u2019m in agony.\u201d She started to tear up. \u201cI\u2019m all out,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d She called someone else. \u201cListen, listen, listen \u2014 I wanted to ask you. What can you give me for one? \u2018Cause I\u2019m sick. I just need one,\u201d she said, just one bag. Someone texted someone to see if he would make a trade for the Seroquel, give her something she could sell to someone else. She waited; she heard from a friend that a guy who owed her would meet her outside the AutoZone in Hazleton. So she headed there and waited, charging her phone inside the store. Forty-five minutes went by. She walked on wobbly legs into the Japanese restaurant next door, desperate for a bathroom. She vomited and then walked out, still wobbly. She couldn\u2019t wait any longer for that guy at the AutoZone. \u201cIt\u2019s so time-consuming,\u201d she said at one point. \u201cIt should not be this hard to get drugs.\u201d\n\nIn parts of Europe, government and medical officials have decided that there\u2019s some sense in what Ann said: That the difficulty addicts have obtaining drugs accounts for much of the crime problem. In Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands, the most entrenched heroin addicts can turn to prescription heroin, safe heroin administered at medical sites, an approach that has been found to reduce crime even more than methadone clinics and to improve addicts\u2019 family lives and employment stability.\n\nAnn called someone else who owed her. The best he could do, he said, was offer her some headphones that she could pawn. Maybe they were worth $20, which was, at that moment, a king\u2019s ransom. She took them, but the pawnshop gave her only $5. Maybe she could scrounge up some change in her purse. Ten minutes later, Ann emerged from a home near Alter Street with a bag of heroin; just holding it in her hand, she seemed revived. It was something, but she had a 20-bag-a-day habit, and this would not get her through the night. When she got home, she would start working the phone again.\n\nThree days later, Ann was scheduled for an arraignment on the charges of theft of her mother\u2019s jewelry. Ann\u2019s father accompanied Ann and Lucy to court, and as the three of them bickered and shushed one another, Ann seemed bolstered by the normalcy of family life \u2014 her father stern and finger-wagging, her mother by her side.\n\nNow Ann\u2019s mother was simultaneously housing her daughter and trying as hard as she could to put her in jail; at least in jail, her mother believed, she would get clean.\n\nLucy had been under the impression that Ann was very likely to be escorted directly from the courthouse to jail. Instead the judge told all the defendants to plead not guilty and gave them court dates when their cases would be heard. \u201cWhat a joke,\u201d Lucy muttered.\n\nAnn was relieved. She could go home with her mom, spend time at the house where her father and brother lived; her father would watch the kids during the day. Things would go on, somehow, with some semblance of what she now considered normal: her children around her, the endless hustling for heroin, the usual daily grind.\n\nBut then Lucy told her she had to move out: Social Services, which granted Lucy temporary custody of her grandchildren after Tom was arrested, had said Ann could not stay at the apartment, for the good of the kids.\n\nSo Ann left. From that point on, her life didn\u2019t resemble anything that had come before. Lucy caught only glimpses of it, which was about as much as she could take. Ann ran out of minutes on her phone and rarely called. A few weeks out, Ann came by Lucy\u2019s work to ask for money, for contact lenses, she told Lucy. Her face was black and blue. She had had a fight with another woman, also a user, over a guy \u2014 not so much over the guy, but over who was going to get a ride from him. Ann needed to be driven to a hearing that would determine whether Lucy\u2019s custody status would shift from temporary to permanent; the other woman wanted a ride to get a fix. Ann didn\u2019t make it to the hearing.\n\nShe was staying at a motel with friends, she told her mother, playing it off as if that were fine, although Lucy knew what kind of motel it was, a rathole where she would be afraid to seek out her daughter. At some point, Ann reached out to Davenport, who was now working in a nearby town, asking for help finding a place to stay. She and Davenport arranged a time to talk, but Ann didn\u2019t show up. The detective felt for Ann, but she could not make it her business to try to save her. \u201cI am so swamped with cases,\u201d she texted me. \u201cThere are hundreds of Anns out there.\u201d\n\nAt night, Lucy was dreaming about dire phone calls and strange cars pulling up to her door. She could not reach her daughter but knew that she had a second court date, on March 26, for another theft charge; her father accused her of stealing a sander and a hand weight from his home and selling them to a junk shop for $4 and change. He, too, pressed charges and got the state police involved: The girl had to learn there were consequences. Lucy took time off from work to try to see her daughter at the hearing at the magistrate\u2019s office.\n\nWhen Ann showed up, the strains of the past month were visible on her body, which had wasted away, and on her face, which was tinged with gray. Just the night before, the police told Lucy, Ann was picked up for shoplifting several hundred dollars\u2019 worth of clothing at a Walmart next door to the magistrate judge\u2019s office.\n\nNow Ann was panicked that the judge might not let her remain free before the trial, which was customary for small offenses. Shaking with nerves and exhaustion, she sat down on a chair in the waiting room and fumbled with her purse. Her eyes were dry and lined with red. She had not taken out her contact lenses in weeks for lack of a case.\n\nThe two Walmart security guards who apprehended Ann the evening before were also crowded into the tiny waiting room, there for someone else\u2019s hearing. They looked away from Ann, and she avoided their eyes, busying herself with her phone and applying concealer and lipstick with a trembling hand.\n\n\u201cI did some shady things, I have to get my act together,\u201d Ann said under her breath. \u201cBut it\u2019s been very, very hard. Very.\u201d For weeks, she had been catching sleep, along with a crowd of other users, in motel rooms that a new dealer friend let them use when he didn\u2019t need them for business. Every day, the crew woke up and started the same routine: What could they buy? Where could they buy it? Who had the cash? How would they get there? She was using crack, was sleepless and agitated; her nails were lined with dirt, and she had a broken finger that she thought was infected, its splint grimy.\n\nEventually a public defender came out of the courtroom, a tall, balding man with a baby face and a reassuringly adult suit. He could not represent Ann, he explained, until she filed the appropriate paperwork, but he could give her some advice: Don\u2019t lie. Try to sound calm. Volunteer to go straight to rehabilitation therapy as a condition of bail. Ann was praying the hearing would be postponed until she had a public defender assigned. She was terrified of jail.\n\nTom had tried to warn her this day was coming. The one time she visited him in jail, Ann was high, and now that he wasn\u2019t using drugs anymore, he couldn\u2019t bear to see her that way. He told her she had to get off heroin. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she told him. He knew he would have said the same thing months before: Tom was the one with the 50-bag-a-day habit, the one who had overdosed on a mix of heroin and Xanax, only to rush out of the hospital so he could go back home and shoot up. In jail, he had no choice but to stop using, and in a strange way, he was grateful. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to think it over,\u201d he said, when I visited him in the Luzerne County Correctional Facility. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about me. I\u2019ve got two kids, and they\u2019re suffering.\u201d Loose-limbed, with a steady gaze, Tom said he was resolved to stay off drugs when he got out, though he looked wary as he said it: He knew how hard it would be. He could not say what his future would hold with Ann, but he felt responsible for where her life had gone. \u201cTo be dead honest,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cit\u2019s all my doing.\u201d\n\nOnce she was seated in front of the magistrate, a tidy-looking man with dark hair, Ann reached deep into the recesses of memory and pulled out an earlier version of herself: the passable student teachers liked, who used to go shopping for clothing with her mom, who showed up for a steady job with manicured nails, who changed her son\u2019s diapers and gazed into his crib with pride. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live like this anymore,\u201d she told the judge. \u201cI really don\u2019t. If possible, if I could get into something today?\u201d She was asking for some kind of a treatment program. \u201cI was on heroin,\u201d she told him, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t used in the last two weeks.\u201d\n\nAnn\u2019s father had known the magistrate since he was a boy: He and the magistrate\u2019s father had worked together at a local coal mine. Now Ann\u2019s father sat in the back of the courtroom, arms folded in disgust at the state of his daughter. The magistrate listened carefully to Ann, then set the bail at $10,000. The public defender had gently tried to warn Ann that the judge might set a high bail \u2014 given her obvious drug problem, given that even previous arrests did not seem to deter her from committing more crimes. But Ann was nevertheless shocked: \u201cI\u2019m going to jail?\u201d she asked, incredulous. Many months down the road, Ann could be referred to treatment court, where her record would be expunged if she underwent a prolonged period of treatment with clean drug tests. But all of that was an abstraction; now she was filled with the immediate fear of the humiliations of jail, the utter loss of control. Tom went to jail, and he was still there, six months later.\n\nShe started pleading with the magistrate. \u201cI don\u2019t have a chance to do anything at all?\u201d she asked. The magistrate was now looking down at some papers, ready to move on to the next hearing, but Ann argued on, trying frantically to lay blame elsewhere. She had just put a deposit down on an apartment, she claimed. \u201cSo I finally have a place to live,\u201d she shouted, panic rising in her voice. \u201cI explained that to my mother, but she doesn\u2019t believe me.\u201d\n\nShe put her head in her hands and cried. Ann suddenly looked very small in the courtroom. The magistrate took a small breath, as an officer of the court moved in to cuff her hands. \u201cIf you want to blame somebody, don\u2019t blame your mom,\u201d he told Ann. \u201cBlame yourself.\u201d\n\nAnd then, hands shackled, she was escorted toward the courtroom exit. \u201cCan I just have my phone?\u201d she asked. It had all her connections. \u201cI just need to be able to call someone,\u201d she said, \u201csomeone who could help me.\u201d\n\nAfter a month in the Luzerne County Correctional Facility, Ann was released to a rehabilitation center as a condition of bail; as of May 1, she said she\u2019d been clean for 36 days.",

    "text": "Sam Martin was browsing in a Boston record store 23 years ago when an unusual photography book caught his eye. Mr. Martin flipped through its pages, which featured portraits and interviews with women who had become men, and started to cry.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, my God, I\u2019m not the only one,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Martin, 43, who started transitioning to male from female after he bought the book. \u201cWhen I was growing up, I never saw people like me in movies or books.\u201d\n\nMr. Martin is now on a mission to change that. He belongs to a small group of emerging authors who are writing children\u2019s literature that centers on transgender characters, hoping to fill the void they felt as young readers. His debut work of fiction \u2014 a semi-autobiographical story about a transgender teenage boy who falls in love with an older boy on the beach in Cape Cod \u2014 will be published in a collection this month by Duet, a new young adult publisher that specializes in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer fiction.\n\n\u201cMy goal was to write stories that would have helped me feel less alone at that age,\u201d said Mr. Martin, who works as a Starbucks barista in Washington and writes at night.\n\nA few years ago, gender fluidity was rarely addressed in children\u2019s and young adult fiction. It remained one of the last taboos in a publishing category that had already taken on difficult issues like suicide, drug abuse, rape and sex trafficking. But children\u2019s literature is catching up to the broader culture, as stereotypes of transgender characters have given way to nuanced and sympathetic portrayals on TV shows like \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cTransparent.\u201d\n\nRecently, the highly publicized transformation of the reality TV star and former Olympian Bruce Jenner into Caitlyn Jenner \u2014 revealed to the world via a glamorous portrait on the cover of Vanity Fair \u2014 brought even more visibility to the movement for transgender equality.\n\nMore writers and publishers have started tackling the subject, not just with memoirs and self-help guides tailored to transgender youth, but through novels aimed at a broad readership. This year, children\u2019s publishers are releasing around half a dozen novels in a spectrum of genres, including science fiction and young adult romance, that star transgender children and teenagers. \u201cIn our culture, it was really something that was in the shadows, but suddenly people are talking about it,\u201d said David Levithan, vice president and publisher of Scholastic Press. \u201cAs our culture is starting to acknowledge transgender people and acknowledge that they are part of the fabric of who we are, literature is reflecting that.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the movement\u2019s debut authors have published books drawn from their own experiences. Last fall, a transgender teenager named Jazz Jennings published \u201cI Am Jazz,\u201d a picture book she co-wrote about a transgender girl. Simon & Schuster released dual memoirs by Katie Rain Hill and Arin Andrews, two transgender teenagers from Oklahoma who met and fell in love.\n\nMr. Andrews, 19, said that books for young adults on the subject were scarce when he began transitioning to male from female in 2011.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started transitioning, I mostly had YouTube as a source,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to write a book to help others because there were not a lot of sources out there, and I thought that one book could save a person\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nMr. Andrews says he receives 15 to 20 Facebook messages a day from readers about his memoir, \u201cSome Assembly Required,\u201d including notes from children as young as 8 and readers in their 60s and 70s who say the book helps them navigate questions about their gender identity.\n\nThe body of children\u2019s literature on the subject is still tiny and relatively new. When Julie Anne Peters published \u201cLuna,\u201d a novel about a teenage girl whose brother wants to be a girl, in 2004, it was the first young-adult novel with a transgender character to be released by a mainstream publisher. Since then, more than 50 novels with transgender characters have been published, mostly for teenagers, according to Talya Sokoll, a librarian who compiled a reading list of children\u2019s books with trans characters.\n\nSome of the writers who are exploring the topic have faced criticism and online attacks. A blistering Amazon review for \u201cI am Jazz,\u201d written for 4- to 8-year-olds, called the story of a transgender girl \u201cinappropriate material for young readers,\u201d while another reviewer scolded, \u201cWe should not be indoctrinating young kids about \u2018trans.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut writers and publishers have been undeterred, noting that child psychologists and L.G.B.T. advocacy groups argue that very young children can question their gender identity and that families should be open to discussing the subject. The next frontier for authors writing about transgender people seems to be middle-grade literature, or books aimed at 8- to 12-year-olds. In November, Disney Hyperion published \u201cGracefully Grayson,\u201d a novel for readers ages 10 and up about a sixth-grade boy who feels like a girl.\n\nIn August, Scholastic will publish \u201cGeorge,\u201d a middle-grade debut novel about a boy who knows he is a girl but doesn\u2019t know how to tell his family and friends. George decides to try out for the part of Charlotte in a school production of \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d in hopes that it will help others see him the way he sees himself. For readers, it\u2019s not much of a leap. From the first paragraph, an omniscient narrator refers to George as \u201cshe,\u201d so that when other characters use male pronouns to refer to George, it feels jarring.\n\nThe author, Alex Gino, who grew up in Staten Island and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, identifies as genderqueer, a gender identity that falls outside of the male/female binary, and goes by the pronoun \u201cthey.\u201d Alex started writing \u201cGeorge\u201d 12 years ago, while working as a tutor, and wrote more than a dozen drafts.\n\n\u201cI wrote it because it was the book I wanted to read,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI wanted trans voices telling trans stories.\u201d\n\nIn the first draft, Alex didn\u2019t even use the word \u201ctransgender.\u201d \u201cI was like, how would a 10-year-old ever come across that word, but now I\u2019m like, of course they would,\u201d Alex said.\n\nScholastic is facing resistance from some teachers and librarians who question whether third and fourth graders are ready for the discussion. About a month ago, the publisher sent 10,000 early copies to teachers around the country to get feedback, and the responses were largely positive with some mixed reactions.\n\nBut Scholastic is aiming to turn the book into a mainstream success. It increased the first printing to 50,000 from 35,000 based on strong preorders and sent Alex to meet with booksellers and librarians at the ABC Children\u2019s Institute in Pasadena, Calif., and at BookExpo in New York. They hired Jamie Clayton, a transgender actress, to narrate the audiobook.\n\nSo far, early responses from parents of young readers have been encouraging. Marietta Zacker, a literary agent who lives in South Orange, N.J., picked up a copy of \u201cGeorge\u201d at the expo and read it with her 11-year-old daughter, Natalia, who loved it.\n\n\u201cIt was not shocking to her,\u201d Ms. Zacker said. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of every person, the quest to be your own self.\u201d\n\nCarolyn Mackler, a young-adult novelist who lives in Manhattan, gave a copy of \u201cGeorge\u201d to her 10-year-old son to read. She told him that it was about a transgender child and explained what that meant. After he read it, she asked him what he thought.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018If you met George, would you be friends with him?\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Mom, it\u2019s her, and I would be friends with her if she was nice.\u2019 \u201d",

    "text": "Donald Trump on Sunday warned darkly of the danger posed by Somali migrants in Minneapolis, a deeply segregated city that has the largest Somali-American community in the US.\n\n\u201cHere in Minnesota, you\u2019ve seen first-hand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with very large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without your support or approval,\u201d the Republican nominee told a rally in the solidly Democratic state, two days before the presidential election.\n\nHe then claimed: \u201cSome of them [are] joining Isis and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s reading about the disaster taking place in Minnesota,\u201d he added, before claiming, falsely: \u201cYou don\u2019t even have the right to talk about it.\u201d\n\nTrump has made warnings about refugees a staple of his stump speech, though he has most commonly targeted Syrians fleeing the five-year civil war that has devastated their country.\n\nThree Somali Americans, two US citizens and one a lawful resident, pleaded guilty in June to trying to join the terror group Islamic State, or Isis. Law enforcement officials have said that more than 30 young men from Minnesota have left the county to join Isis or al-Shabaab, which operates in east Africa.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, more than 85,000 Somali Americans lived in the US with the largest concentration living in the Twin Cities. Despite integration campaigns by the community \u2013 a former refugee is poised to win office as a state lawmaker, for instance \u2013 the area remains one of the most racially segregated in the US.\n\nThe Republican nominee has said he would bar refugees from settling in places without the approval of local governments. A federal court ruled against Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, in October, when he tried to block Syrian refugees from settling in his state.\n\nIn that decision, judge Richard Posner said Pence\u2019s actions were discriminatory, and \u201cthe equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they\u2019re black but because he\u2019s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn\u2019t discriminating\u201d.\n\nIn Minneapolis on Sunday, Trump said blocking refugees would be \u201cthe least [government] can do for you\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve suffered enough in Minnesota,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will pause admissions from terror-prone regions until a full security assessment has been performed and until a proven vetting mechanism has been established.\u201d\n\nThe US has some of the strictest vetting procedures in the world, requiring multiple stages of interviews with security agencies, background and health checks, and the process can last two years. Trump has not specified which countries he would bar migration from, nor many details of what he calls \u201cextreme vetting\u201d.\n\nTrump argued that these methods would prevent terror attacks in the US, citing \u201cthe recent terrorist attack in St Cloud\u201d. In that Minnesotan city, in September, a 20-year-old Somali American man stabbed eight people in a mall, before being fatally shot by a police officer.\n\nThe next day, leaders of the Somali community condemned the attack and the FBI said it was investigating it as a \u201cpotential act of terror\u201d. It released few details.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible what they\u2019re doing and if you want people to pour in Minnesota all you have to do is vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Trump said on Sunday.\n\nSomali Americans have become a target for domestic terrorists. In September, three members of a militia group were arrested for allegedly plotting to bomb an apartment building in Garden City, Kansas, with a number of Somali-American residents and where one apartment was used as a mosque.\n\nThe three men arrested could face life in prison.\n\nAccording to the FBI complaint filed against the suspects, the men called themselves \u201cthe Crusaders\u201d and Muslims \u201ccockroaches\u201d, and said that they wanted to \u201cwake people up\u201d with \u201ca bloodbath\u201d.",

    "text": "NEW DELHI, May 30\u2014 President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh was shot and killed in the port city of Chittagong early today and a broadcast by the Dacca radio said a little-known opposition group was responsible for the assassination.\n\nA state of emergency was declared by Vice President Abdus Sattar, who assumed the duties of Acting President. Rebels announced over the radio from Chittagong that they were taking over the Government, but officials in Dacca said that they were still in control.\n\nThe 45-year-old President Zia, two aides and several bodyguards reportedly were killed as they were sleeping in a guest house in Chittagong, a district capital of 890,000 people.\n\nThe news of the killing and a proclamation of an emergency were broadcast over Dacca radio this morning. Acting President Sattar signed emergency legislation suspending the rights of citizens in the country of 87 million.\n\nThe Acting President ordered a curfew in Dacca, the capital, Chittagong and other major cities and called for a 40-day period of mourning for the President. President Zia, an army general who took over the Government in November 1975, was reported to have been shot during his visit to Chittagong near the border with Burma. Many opponents of the Government have been active in the area.\n\nDacca radio said ''miscreants'' were responsible for the killings, but it gave no details. Another broadcast quoted the Government as saying that a group called Biplabi Parishad was responsible for the assassination and it called on a Maj. Gen. Manzur Ahmed to surrender. The organization was said to include rebels from the armed forces, and Major General Ahmed was believed to be its leader. Army Reportedly Remains Loyal\n\nLater radio reports said the rebels were led by Maj. Gen. Abul Manzur, The Associated Press reported. The rebels claimed to have taken control of the Government.\n\nLieut. Gen. H.M. Arshad, the army chief of staff, was quoted as saying that a revolutionary council headed by General Manzur had taken control of Chittagong radio station. But General Arshad said other members of the armed forces were remaining loyal to the Government.\n\nReports carried by Bangladesh radio and quoted by the Press Trust of India, a news agency, said President Zia and several aides and bodyguards were killed as they were sleeping in a district guest house in Chittagong at about 3:30 A.M. (5 P.M. Friday, New York time).\n\nDacca radio announced the news seven hours later along with an appeal to the armed forces ''not to be guided by provocations from outside.'' The first reports of President Zia's death suggested only that he had died in an accident.\n\nAccording to information reaching New Delhi, the group that seized Chittagong radio also appeared to be in control of the Chittagong area. Among the radio announcements was one declaring that a treaty of friendship between Indian and Bangladesh signed in 1972 was abrogated. Communications Are Interrupted\n\nChittagong radio went dead at about 2 P.M. Communications between India and Bangladesh also ended as telecommunication lines were cut. Acting President Sattar, a 76-year-old lawyer who had been in key positions of the Government since 1975, said in his broadcast that there would be no change in foreign policy and that agreements with foreign countries would be honored.\n\nPresident Zia had been in firm control of the Government since he seized power five years ago in the last of a series of army coups following the assassination of President Mujibur Rahman, an immensely popular figure who led Bangladesh to independence from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nSome Bangladeshis use their first names as the surname. Ziaur Rahman becomes Zia, instead of Ziaur, in subsequent references because the last two letters of his surname form an article that is used with the second name. Similarly, the name of Mujibur Rahman becomes Mujib on second reference.\n\nPresident Zia, designating himself as the martial law administrator, kept the country under strict controls for awhile. But he appeared to have consolidated his position after he put down a series of revolts by low-ranking servicemen in northern Bangladesh, including an abortive coup by air force rebels in 1977. An Overwhelming Election Victory\n\nHe was confirmed in the office in a national referendum that showed overwhelming support for his Government. President Zia lifted martial law and began to push a popular concept of revolution aimed at making Bangladesh self-sufficient in food.\n\nNational harvests usually fall about 20 percent short of fulfilling Bangladesh's needs, and the country has remained largely dependent on international aid. Western countries have contributed $10 billion in food and other aid since 1971.\n\nPresident Zia was generally regarded as a benevolent dictator as he strived to change the image of his country as one of the world's most backward. Huge irrigation projects and vigorous campaigns for birth control appeared to be making headway.\n\nPresident Zia was also pursuing a plan for regional cooperation among Southeast Asian countries that found a ready response in several countries of the region, including India.\n\nHowever, political problems resurfaced suddenly. Daughter Returns From Exile\n\nSheik Mujib's Awami League elected his 33-year-old daughter, Hasina Wazed, as president of the party. Sent into exile in India after the death of her father, she returned to Dacca this month to a tumultuous welcome even as the Government-controlled media unleashed a propaganda barrage against her, saying she was an Indian agent.\n\nDisputes over an Indian-built dike that diverted some water from the Ganges to the Indian side and sovereignty over a new island that emerged near the coasts of India and Bangladesh have soured relations between the two countries.\n\nAs Dacca appeared to be adopting a policy of confrontation with India, New Delhi attributed the belligerence to growing internal tension threatening the stability of President Zia's Government.\n\nIn a message today, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India expressed ''deep concern'' over the development in a ''friendly'' neighboring country and renewed a pledge of cooperation and friendship with Bangladesh.\n\nIllustrations: Photo of Ziaur Rahman",
    "summary": "President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh was shot and killed in the port city of Chittagong early today and a broadcast by the Dacca radio said a little-known opposition group was responsible for the assassination.   A state of emergency was declared by Vice President Abdus Sattar, who assumed the duties of Acting President. Rebels announced over the radio from Chittagong that they were taking over the Government, but officials in Dacca said that they were still in control.   The 45-year-old President Zia, two aides and several bodyguards reportedly were killed as they were sleeping in a guest house in Chittagong, a district capital of 890,000 people."

    "text": "That is not necessarily good news. As a ritual in the play, presented at Playwrights Horizons through Sunday, the consumption of food has dark implications. And then there\u2019s the cuisine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s grotesque,\u201d Mr. LeFranc said in a recent interview, describing the dismal menu of low-rent classics like spaghetti in tomato sauce and turkey burger with fries as \u201cchain-restaurant goopiness.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s average food for average Americans, whose emotional crises, tangled relationships and intergenerational conflicts Mr. LeFranc (whose last name rhymes with \u201chonk\u201d) takes as his subject in \u201cThe Big Meal.\u201d In the kind of restaurants usually described as \u201cfamily casual,\u201d his characters meet, love, quarrel, separate, reunite, age and grieve over a period of about 65 years, a span that unfolds on the stage in a little less than 90 minutes, with the small cast of actors playing multiple parts.\n\nIt\u2019s territory that Mr. LeFranc, 31, knows well. \u201cI pretty much grew up in restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents met in the Pump Room in Chicago, where my father was a manager, and my mother was a waitress.\u201d (The play was first produced at the American Theater Company there; another production begins performances at the Studio Theater in Washington this week.)\n\nAfter moving to Laguna Beach, in Orange County, Calif., in the late 1970s his father took a manager\u2019s job at El Torito, a Mexican chain. He helped open Las Brisas, a landmark Mexican seafood restaurant, and eventually ran two well-known Southern California chains, Ruby\u2019s Diner and Louise\u2019s Trattoria.\n\nMr. LeFranc grew up with his mother and stepfather after his parents divorced when he was 5, but the restaurantgoing never stopped. He and his younger sister, Lauren, now a television writer, hung out at the bar at Stix, a pan-Asian restaurant, while his mother finished up her waitressing shift.\n\nIn the evenings, like the characters in \u201cThe Big Meal,\u201d the family headed to humble neighborhood joints and midlevel chains like Acapulco, Ball Park Pizza, Chevys, Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill. The food might not have been much, but the drama sizzled.\n\n\u201cWe were pretty raucous,\u201d Mr. LeFranc said. \u201cThere was a lot of brawling back in the day, usually over something like whether a certain word was in the dictionary. It seemed like everyone else in the restaurant was polite, and we were the troublemakers.\u201d\n\nMr. LeFranc said that he toyed with the idea of writing a restaurant play for years but was not sure what it might look or sound like. A breakthrough came when he was working on \u201cSixty Miles to Silver Lake\u201d at Soho Rep in 2009. Asher Richelli, an executive director of Page 73 Productions, which presented the play in partnership with Soho Rep, asked him if he had ever read \u201cThe Long Christmas Dinner,\u201d a one-act by Thornton Wilder. \u201cYou guys seem to be in conversation,\u201d he told Mr. LeFranc.\n\nMr. LeFranc had not. But Wilder\u2019s abbreviated drama, which traces the history of an American family through 90 years\u2019 worth of holiday meals, captured his imagination, and he set to work. The family dining room of yore was replaced by the restaurant table of today. Turning a legal pad sideways and dividing it into eight columns, he wove long strands of his own family\u2019s history into lightning-fast scenes and staccato dialogue, comic and heartbreaking by turns. \u201cThere had to be chaos and crosstalk to capture the experience of being there,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd, of course, food. The actors, in a series of charged symbolic moments, each address a rather substantial meal, eating slowly in the glare of a spotlight, against a background of absolute silence. They don\u2019t just nibble, either.\n\nTom Bloom, in this regard, performs heroically. Playing multiple grandfathers, he works his way through two dinners at each performance. The first, a bland-looking plate of mashed potatoes in gravy and broccoli, he modified by baking his own potatoes and mashing them, and buying a nicer roll.\n\nAfter five weeks of eating chipped beef for his second meal, he experienced palate fatigue. \u201cI loved chipped beef in the Navy, but this particular version was very salty,\u201d he said. \u201cThe food is supposed to look like old-person\u2019s pabulum, so I asked if we could do chopped tomato in a cream sauce. When you\u2019re eating 18 dinners a week, I figure you deserve a little leeway.\u201d His wish was granted.\n\nGriffin Birney, as the young boy, is stuck with chicken fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s the only food mentioned specifically in the script,\u201d Mr. LeFranc said. \u201cThere\u2019s just something sad about chicken fingers.\u201d\n\nIn real life Mr. LeFranc has moved on from Chili\u2019s. He is in fact a foodie, or a least a foodie in training. He settled in New York after earning an M.F.A. in playwriting from Brown in 2009. Taking up residence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, he set to work mastering the local food vernacular. Franny\u2019s, which he describes as a \u201cfarm to fork\u201d restaurant, is a favorite. \u201cThere\u2019s also a pizza place that\u2019s dangerously close to my apartment, Barboncino,\u201d he said.\n\nThe quality has improved since Orange County, but the sense of drama remains. It is almost routine for food writers to remark on the similarities between restaurants and theaters as cultural forms of expression, right down to the three-act formula of appetizer, entree, dessert. Mr. LeFranc has thought through the implications more deeply than most, perhaps because he has spent a good part of his life studying menus \u2014 and stealing them at his father\u2019s behest.\n\n\u201cThe thing about a restaurant meal is that you can\u2019t escape,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you sit down and get a drink and the appetizer arrives, you have to take the ride to the end. Especially, when you\u2019re a kid, you\u2019re extra trapped. To leave the table and run out is a big deal. Not that I didn\u2019t do it pretty often.\u201d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Big Meal\u00e2\u0080\u009d runs through Sunday at the Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com, playwrightshorizons.org.",

    "text": "Folks repeatedly ask me about rental and condominium apartment buildings that were erected during recent years in Washington: Why, they wonder, are most units in most new buildings so small? Is this the result of some kind of herd mentality in the world of residential real estate development?\n\nComplaints are similar: Efficiency units are too tiny and too predominant; one-bedroom and even relatively scarce two-bedroom units are hardly commodious; and finding a three-bedroom apartment is next to impossible.\n\nMy explanation is always the same. Prevailing market demand, generated mostly by millennials and empty nesters, is what guides developers, lenders and investors. They finance and build whatever they think can be sold or rented reasonably quickly to cover development costs and produce an acceptable return on investment.\n\n[Micro-units coming to desirable locations in the District]\n\nAlthough often unfairly demonized, most developers build what public policy, embodied in adopted master plans and zoning regulations, enables them to build.\n\nStill, some people wonder why public policies, laws and regulations don\u2019t prescribe the type and size of dwelling units that new condo or rental apartment buildings should contain. After all, lots of other physical design parameters are prescribed: building height limits; minimum yard dimensions; maximum lot coverage; number of off-street parking spaces; accessibility standards; and energy-consumption and conservation criteria.\n\nInclusive zoning in jurisdictions such as Washington and Montgomery County require developers of sizable new housing projects to rent or sell a percentage of those units at below-market rates. The public interest justification for this mandate is the growing shortage of and need for affordable housing.\n\nApplying analogous reasoning, couldn\u2019t state, county or municipal laws justifiably stipulate some minimum number of two- and three-bedroom units within new multi-unit housing developments?\n\nThis would be a very tough sell, not only here in metropolitan Washington but also throughout the United States.\n\n[Why it\u2019s so hard to find a cheap apartment in Washington, D.C.]\n\nDevelopers and property owners would be strongly opposed on many grounds, the foremost being that such a requirement would be un-American, an assault on private property rights. It would be condemned as unconstitutional government interference in the free market and freedom of marketing.\n\nHousing and real estate industry professionals would bolster the free market and marketing arguments, asserting that the type, size and mix, as well as quality and pricing, of dwelling units in a building are exclusively private-sector business decisions.\n\nThey also would point out that there exists and always will exist an immense inventory of larger dwellings of all types, sizes and quality \u2014 townhouses, duplexes, older apartment buildings, garden-apartment complexes, single-family detached homes \u2014 on the market and available in cities and suburbs.\n\nAnd, of course, most elected government officials, nodding their heads in agreement, would undoubtedly opine that political support for such a requirement would be feeble.\n\nTo counter these arguments, proponents of prescribing apartment unit configurations in land-use regulations would have to build a compelling case. They would have to show that such regulation would be in the public interest; that it would help meet real and pressing societal and demographic needs; and that, without it, a measurable segment of the American population would be deprived of fair, adequate and affordable housing opportunities in many locations intended to serve everyone.\n\nProponents could point out in particular that, because of the preponderance of very small and expensive apartments proliferating in downtown Washington, families of moderate means with school-age children have few viable housing options if they want to live in a walkable city neighborhood with convenient access to jobs and transit. Their only realistic spatial and economic choice is a home in suburbia and a lengthy commute.\n\nBut these counterarguments are likely to prove unpersuasive. Given the American political and economic context, plus current market conditions, probably only one strategy would be feasible in helping augment supplies of new larger apartments in Washington and elsewhere.\n\nFor each site and project, the local government and the project developer could negotiate and reach an agreement concerning a publicly desirable program of dwelling unit types and mix. Yet if that program differs from what the developer\u2019s real estate market analysis shows to be the best marketing approach, the government would have to provide financial incentives enabling the developer to implement the project and fulfill the dwelling-unit program economically.\n\nOtherwise, for now, most new apartments will continue to be much too small and much too costly for many households.\n\nRoger K. Lewis is a practicing architect, a professor emeritus of architecture at the University of Maryland and a regular guest commentator on WAMU\u2019s \u201cThe Kojo Nnamdi Show.\u201d",

The formula in its current iteration doesn't accommodate financials or utilities companies. Greenblatt says he may work on that in the future.\n\nJoel Greenblatt: Another thing that will be launching this quarter, which is really interesting, is a global fund that looks at 40 different countries across the world. We created our own database, analyzing those companies.\n\nSteve Forbes: Have you, going back in time, found that this works as well as with foreign companies as U.S. companies? Can you trust those numbers?\n\nGreenblatt: Well, that's a great question. We've looked at the databases internationally and decided that we have to create our own. So going back and looking, there have been people who've done studies after I wrote the book. There are a number of Wall Street firms that did studies that showed it worked in every country. You know, they tested about 12 different countries.\n\nAnd these principles, value investing, for instance, buying cheap, buying good, works in all these countries, according to their research. We haven't bothered to do that because a) we have no doubt that these principles work, but b) the data are not very good outside of the U.S. The U.S. is pretty good. Compustat, for instance, has a great product and a number of others. Outside the U.S., the data's not so good, so that if you use bad data, garbage in, garbage out, you'll have some of the outliers coming to the top. We decided two years ago that we had to create our own database for the global and we did. We also have our own database for the domestic. And we're going to launch something for Formula Investing and make it accessible to people to invest in 40 different countries in a group project, in a group with about 45 companies in that portfolio. And so that will be a unique, fun product that we're launching this quarter.\n\nForbes: Are you going to have a formula that can work for financials and utilities?\n\nGreenblatt: If I get time. I really started this project about seven or eight years ago with one person. We now have, just in research, we have 17 people working on this now. And so it's on our list, I would say. But this thing kind of snowballed much larger than I ever imagined when we started with one person. And it was sort of just a proof of concept, you know, of the things I've been teaching and using over the years. And so it's kind of snowballed into a big deal. And that's certainly one of the things that we want to develop but we haven't. We haven't even attempted it yet, we have so much on our plate.",

    "text": "The failure of Alabama's lone cruise port has left the city of Mobile with a looming problem: How to pay for a more than $20 million passenger terminal that's now used for dances and weddings rather than tourist embarkations.\n\nFor years, parking charges and other fees paid by cruisers covered debt payments of about $2 million annually for the Alabama Cruise Terminal. But those funds will run out at the end of the current fiscal year, leaving promoters and city officials only six months to either secure a new cruise ship or figure out another way to pay for the 65,000-square-foot building.\n\nThe terminal's manager, Sheila Gurganus, said she is trying to promote the city as a cruise homeport at industry meetings. Yet she also is trying to generate enough money to pay utility bills at the terminal by renting out the mammoth building for Mardi Gras events, weddings and school proms.\n\n\"I don't have any marketing money here, but I've been using the cruise terminal as a very popular venue,\" said Gurganus, one of only three remaining workers at the cavernous terminal, located on the western shore of Mobile Bay.\n\nA spokeswoman for the city, Barbara Drummond, said officials aren't sure how to pay the mortgage on the 7-year-old terminal when the bill starts going to the city on Oct. 1. The final decision will come down to Mayor Sam Jones and the City Council.\n\n\"The mayor and the Cruise Commission are still in active recruitment and trying to get a cruise company to come back to Mobile,\" she said. \"They've had a couple of offers, but nothing concrete.\"\n\nCouncil President Reggie Copeland said the city has enough in reserves to pay the rent for one year, but an additional 1 cent sales tax may be needed to help cover the debt if the city fails to lure another ship.\n\n\"It's going to eat into some of our revenue sources, but it was a gamble we took,\" he said.\n\nThe terminal debt payment isn't huge for a city with overall revenues of almost $200 million, but the mayor's office already is projecting a budget deficit of as much as $29 million for the upcoming fiscal year. Some council members are contesting the figure, but Copeland said the reserve fund \u2014 normally set aside for emergencies including hurricanes \u2014 can absorb the terminal payments regardless of other problems.\n\nCarnival Cruise Lines announced plans to base a small ship, the Holiday, in Mobile, and the city decided to build the terminal in 2004. The state retirement system funded construction initially, and the city then bought out the pension fund and operated the terminal on its own.\n\n\"We were netting $1 million a year,\" Copeland said. Parking revenues and other fees covered the debt payments, he said.\n\nWith the ship generally at or near capacity, the company replaced Holiday with a larger ship, Elation, which is 855 feet long and carries 2,052 passengers. But last year, the cruise line relocated Elation to New Orleans because the trips weren't making enough money.\n\nGurganus said the lack of a turning basin large enough to handle ships at least 900 feet long is hurting Mobile, even though the terminal is only several miles from the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The city still gets occasional visits from smaller cruise ships, she said.\n\nBut cruise industry watcher Carolyn Brown said inadequate marketing is a big part of Mobile's problem in luring another ship to replace Elation, which made its final trip from Mobile last fall. The domestic cruise industry is getting more competitive as companies relocate ships overseas, and Mobile has not done enough to promote itself as a potential home port or destination, said Brown, chief editor of cruisecritic.com.\n\n\"I think unless you already know about Mobile you don't know about Mobile, and that's the problem,\" she said.\n\nThe city has long lived in the shadow of New Orleans, its neighbor 150 miles to the west. But Brown said Mobile is not aggressive enough in trying to promote its attractions, which include the battleship USS Alabama; scenic Bellingrath Gardens; nearby Gulf Coast beaches; and a vibrant downtown that resembles a small French Quarter.\n\n\"We cover ports and we never hear from them,\" Brown said.\n\nCopeland said a consultant hired by the city is making inroads with the industry, and he expects Mobile to have another cruise ship soon enough that paying the debt is a problem for only one year.\n\nAmong other things, Copeland said, the city is offering incentives to a potential suitor including free advertising and free tickets to a new maritime museum being built. City leaders hope that can help win another ship and pay the terminal debt before it gets out of hand. Copeland said he cannot name the company being offered the incentives, but a deal is close.\n\n\"I know it's going to happen, but I can't say much more,\" Copeland said. \"The negotiations have been under way.\"",

    "text": "Tuesday brings the biggest primary day of the season. Republicans will pick Senate candidates in Georgia, Kentucky and Oregon. Pennsylvania Democrats will choose their candidate to face Gov. Tom Corbett. And there are an array of open House races in Georgia. (Related: Election Drama in House Primaries Tuesday)\n\nHere\u2019s Washington Wire\u2019s look at five top races to watch Tuesday:\n\nPolls open (ET): 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the Eastern Time Zone, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the Central Time Zone\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is going to win big over challenger Matt Bevin, but there may be clues in Tuesday\u2019s results that tell us something about Mr. McConnell\u2019s general election battle with Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nAs our Dante Chinni points out, if Mr. McConnell puts up big margins in evangelical areas in the primary, it bodes well for him in the general election, when Ms. Grimes may do better in Kentucky\u2019s population centers than did Mr. McConnell\u2019s underfunded 2008 challenger, Bruce Lunsford.\n\nFor Mr. Bevin, Tuesday ends what has been a disappointing effort to oust Mr. McConnell from the right. He poured $900,000 of his own money into the campaign but never gained traction. From making rookie mistakes like allowing himself to debate a McConnell aide to having backed the Troubled Asset Relief Program he attacked Mr. McConnell for supporting to speaking at a pro-cockfighting rally and then having to apologize for it, it has been a parade of errors for Mr. Bevin.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. McConnell has had support from the broad Republican establishment. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association have spent money on his behalf, while Mr. McConnell\u2019s chief antagonists, the Senate Conservatives Fund, has backed Mr. Bevin.\n\nMr. Bevin\u2019s race marks the beginning of what is setting up to be a string of defeats for Republican challengers to incumbent senators. Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel trails Sen. Thad Cochran and over the weekend was forced to explain why a supporter videotaped Mr. Cochran\u2019s ailing wife at her nursing home. In Kansas, physician Milton Wolf hasn\u2019t gained traction against Sen. Pat Roberts after admitting that he wrote Facebook comments about patients he treated.\n\nPolls open (ET): 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nThis is a three-way race to finish second. Former Reebok and Dollar General CEO David Perdue, Rep. Jack Kingston and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel are atop a five-way field to replace Sen. Saxby Chambliss.\n\nSince state law requires a July run-off election if no candidate reaches 50% in the primary \u2013 a certainty in a five-way race \u2013 the drama here is who will finish second, Mr. Kingston or Ms. Handel. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is advertising in heavy rotation to back Mr. Kingston, while Ms. Handel has support from Sarah Palin and Rick Santorum.\n\nDemocrats had hoped \u2013 and Republican establishment types feared \u2013 that one of the two tea-party physicians in the race, Reps. Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey, would advance out of the primary, but odds of that now appear slim. Whichever Republican survives will face Democrat Michelle Nunn in November.\n\nIf Ms. Handel qualifies for the run-off, the contours of the run-off will be clear: She will assume most tea party support while Mr. Kingston, a 22-year House veteran, or Mr. Perdue, whose cousin Sonny Perdue was governor, would be the establishment\u2019s choice. In past years the establishment has lost those intraparty battles. This year the tables have turned.\n\nPolls open (ET): 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nMonica Wehby is the longshot hope for Senate Republicans in 2014. A pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. Wehby raised an impressive amount of money for a first-time candidate, released a set of sharp TV ads and has positioned herself as a moderate in a blue state. Now she only needs to defeat a more conservative primary opponent, state Rep. Jason Conger.\n\nAnd then came the allegations she stalked an ex-boyfriend, who happens to now be a prominent campaign supporter.\n\nThe stalking allegations may have more impact on Dr. Wehby\u2019s general election chances than during the primary \u2013 most Oregonians vote by mail \u2013 but she has not handled the questions with much deft, fleeing a Friday debate \u201cas reporters tried without success to interview her,\u201d Portland\u2019s Oregonian wrote.\n\nMr. Conger is to the right of Dr. Wehby on a host of social issues important to Republicans (gay marriage and abortion rights in particular). But with Dr. Wehby holding double-digit leads in pre-primary polling, the last-minute hit may not be damaging enough to her Tuesday.

Mitt Romney, who won 65% of Idaho\u2019s 2012 vote, filmed an ad backing Mr. Simpson.\n\nIn the end it was too much for Mr. Smith, who has local tea party support but little other help on the TV airwaves.

    "text": "It took just four button taps to squeeze a man's guts out, like a tube of toothpaste. Except you wouldn't brush your teeth with shimmering, red entrails. Five minutes later, a few more button taps left my victim's skull bisected. Her brain rolled out and her tongue lolled outside of a face without a jaw.\n\nAbsurd levels of gore are only part of the Mortal Kombat experience, but revelling in the shattered bones and oozing guts is something that unites casual and serious fans. You know you've arrived at a Mortal Kombat game when successfully ripping someone in half to finish your fight is a sweet reward.\n\nMortal Kombat X embraces the gore, but also builds on the foundation NetherRealm Studios constructed when it rebooted the storied Mortal Kombat franchise in 2011. The game is devoted to its players, every sect of them. It welcomes fighting game newbies with accessible gameplay, piques the interest of those heavily invested in series lore with a dark story and appears to be challenging and balanced enough to encourage highly competitive, professional play.\n\nMortal Kombat X takes a bold choice for the franchise by sending the characters into the future, and introducing us to many of their offspring. After NetherRealm chose to reboot the entire series mythology (akin to many comic book reboots we've seen in the last decade), it's fantastic to see the studio venture into untrod territory with lots of new faces.\n\nMake no mistake: you need to refresh yourself on Mortal Kombat 9's story before diving in here. There is no \"previously on...\" to guide you, so a visit to a wiki, a playthrough or even viewing the previous title's cutscenes on YouTube is pretty much required. Remembering what happened to Raiden, Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade and the rest of our heroes, including the ones that didn't survive, is important in this new story. And that's a lot of people.\n\nYou'll punch and kick through 12 chapters, each focusing on a different character, which has become a signature piece of NetherRealm's games. Each chapter has about four fights that are interspersed between long cinematic cutscenes. One weird feature is the addition of quicktime events, which require timed button presses after being prompted, to move certain scenes forward. Unfortunately, these bursts of interactivity are infrequent enough that you usually let down your guard and miss the first one. While they don't have an effect on the story, they feel weirdly out of place.\n\nMost of the story focuses on the future battle against Shinnok, with flashback chapters interspersed to show us how we got there. Through these, character motivations are revealed. Overall, it's much more character development than fighting game fans are often treated to. In a genre known for its twisting, ridiculous plots, NetherRealm balances that with a closer view of the fan-favorite characters; it's especially true when you see some of the growing relationship between Johnny and Sonya.\n\nIf anything, I wanted more story by the time it was over. When you reach the final battle, it feels more like a middle chapter than a dramatic finisher \u2014 especially after only four to five hours of play. After the previous game's 16 chapters, I wanted something a little more beefy.\n\nThe feeling of not having enough is echoed in your fighter selection. There are 24 playable characters in Mortal Kombat X, plus Goro for those who pre-ordered the game. Four have already been announced as downloadable content as well. But as I met fan-favorite characters (that I won't name because of spoilers) in story mode, I immediately wondered why they weren't playable, and if they'll playable down the line.\n\nThat said, there are several brand new fighters for the series, and they're all dynamite. Mysterious outlaw Erron Black, who fights with both pistols and swords, offers a fun mix of combat styles. Part-insect, part-woman D'vorah's speed and reach \u2014 thanks to insectoid arms that quickly close the gap between her and another fighter \u2014 make her deadly. And Cassie Cage \u2014 the offspring of Johnny and Sonya \u2014 is just plain fun, thanks to a great mix of her parents' techniques folded into one character.\n\nAnd these are just a few examples, since there are eight brand-new playable characters for players to master. But each character has three variants that change the way they handle in battle. Selecting a variation before the fight affects that entire fight; it isn't a mere stance change. These definitely cater to different player's strengths competitively.\n\nFor instance, Sub-Zero's \"Cryomancer\" variation allows him to summon weapons made of ice, which is mapped to quarter-circle gestures. They make him more more offensive, especially because of the powerful overhead ability of his ice axe. But more defensive players may opt for the \"Grandmaster\" variant, which allows Sub-Zero to summon a frozen clone of himself that can be tossed to keep a foe at a distance, or used a shield. Each variant also comes with its own telltale visual cue, so you can see what version of each character you're fighting before they even throw out a move.\n\nFor casual players, that's more than enough options, but seasoned fighting game veterans have a lot of new systems to learn. Mortal Kombat has always had prominence in the professional fighting game community, but this version is already posed to make waves after securing a spot in professional fighting game tournaments before release. No one character or variation seemed too powerful during a few days of play, but watching it shake out over weeks and months will be interesting.\n\nThanks to easy combos, the game is more beginner-friendly than some of its contemporaries. This is most evident in the new \"easy\" fatalities, the gruesome, iconic finishing move the series is known for. Once strictly the domain of perfectly-timed inputs button combos, you can now unlock a character's fatality with just two buttons \u2014 an option that is clearly displayed when a match is paused. But these simplified fatalities aren't free \u2014 they cost in-game currency, so looking cool still costs you if you don't want to learn the longer combos.\n\nMortal Kombat X doesn't add a lot of dramatically new things, but it proves that NetherRealm loves and cares about the franchise \u2014 and its legacy. Its outlandish gore and deep lore are long-established trappings and they haven't gone anywhere, but the deeper-than-ever (<\u2014just a suggestion) fighting game is ready to keep fans invested.\n\nMechanics that style to beginner and advanced play \u2022 Eight fantastic new characters blend well with series staples \u2022 Unique story builds on the Mortal Kombat legacy\n\nSome prominent characters missing from line-up \u2022 story mode could be longer \u2022 quick-time events are a little unnecessary\n\nMore than just a blood fest, Mortal Kombat X builds on the strong foundation of the last game, and is something fans have every reason to be excited for.",

    "text": "Shorter than a bad blind date and as sour as a vinegar Popsicle, \u201cYoung Adult\u201d shrouds its brilliant, brave and breathtakingly cynical heart in the superficial blandness of commercial comedy. More radically than \u201cJ. Edgar\u201d or even \u201cGreenberg,\u201d this movie, written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman, challenges the dreary conventional wisdom that a movie protagonist must be likable. Along the way, it systematically demolishes a china shop full of shopworn sentimental touchstones about \u2014 for starters \u2014 high school, small-town life, heterosexuality, Minnesota and the capacity of human beings to change, learn and grow.\n\nWhen we first encounter her, Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) seems to have grown, though perhaps not in the most constructive ways. Crossing the treacherous, unmarked boundary between her mid- and late-30s, Mavis has acquired some of the trappings and habits of adulthood. She lives in a spacious, slightly sterile high-rise apartment in Minneapolis (a Midwestern variant on the den of Manhattan anomie that Michael Fassbender\u2019s sex-addled character inhabits in \u201cShame\u201d) and has, for company, a fuzzy little dog and a big, flat-screen television permanently tuned to some Kardashian or another.\n\nEventually we hear about a divorce, though not much about the marriage that preceded it. Mavis supports herself by writing installments in a popular series of \u201cGossip Girl\u201d-like novels for teenagers, and though her name does not appear on the cover, she derives some creative and professional satisfaction from the job. She drinks a lot, pulls at her hair and seems generally unconcerned with other people. She is pretty, poised and imperious in the way that can come naturally to tall, beautiful, blond women, but also weary and blue \u2014 a platinum princess suffering from metal fatigue.\n\nLooking for a way to break out of her rut and return some luster to her life, Mavis decides to go back to her hometown, Mercury, Minn., and reconnect with her high school boyfriend, Buddy (Patrick Wilson). Just how spectacularly bad this idea is \u2014 how packed with vanity, magical thinking and plain, stupid meanness \u2014 emerges over the course of a few days, but the warning signs are there from the start.\n\nBuddy, who is married, has just become a father for the first time. To Mavis, this can mean only that he is trapped in a domestic prison from which she must rescue him. And so she arrives in Mercury intent on breaking up his marriage, a plan she justifies to herself in the romantic language of destiny, soul mates and following your heart.\n\nThat is the native idiom of romantic fiction, both the kind Mavis writes and the genre she appears, at first glance, to inhabit. With sly understatement, Ms. Cody and Mr. Reitman (who previously collaborated on \u201cJuno\u201d) allow a set of comfortable expectations to emerge. We all know \u2014 from bad movies like \u201cCars,\u201d say \u2014 that a big-city big shot on a visit to a small town will be constructively humbled by the simple, honest folks who live there. (Or else, as in \u201cStraw Dogs,\u201d terrorized by them). We are also conditioned to believe all kinds of contradictory claptrap about adolescence, which we are supposed to leave behind but also hold onto for (if I may show my own age by paraphrasing John Mellencamp) as long as we can.\n\nOne of the incidental pleasures of \u201cYoung Adult\u201d is its specific sense of generational identity. The logos of bands like Black Flag, the Breeders and \u2014 of course, this being Minnesota \u2014 the Replacements serve as tokens of belonging and signifiers of nostalgia. On the road from Minneapolis to Mercury, Mavis plays an old mixtape (an actual cassette, by the way) from Buddy, fixating on \u201cThe Concept\u201d by Teenage Fanclub, which serves as the film\u2019s ambiguous anthem. It evokes warm and affectionate memories, but also, in her case, the pathological inability to let go of the past.\n\nWe assume that a romantic comedy will turn on the redirection of desire from the wrong person to the right one. In one sense \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say too much about the details of the plot \u2014 this expectation and all the others are met. Mavis does get something of a city mouse\u2019s comeuppance; she does come to difficult terms with her vanished youth; and she does find her attention divided between two guys, the hunk who is her heart\u2019s desire and the nerd who serves as a sympathetic ear and shoulder to cry on. But at the same time, the established codes of modern movie comedy are scrambled and subverted in ways that are puzzling, amusing, horrifying and ultimately astonishing.\n\nThe heroine in \u201cJuno\u201d was briefly dazzled by Jason Bateman\u2019s cool, not-nice guy, but she eventually found her way back to the sweet loser played by Michael Cera. That was impeccable young adult logic, but \u201cYoung Adult\u201d itself is a little more complicated, and much harsher.\n\nBuddy is perfectly nice and not especially cool. The other guy, Matt (Patton Oswalt), is kind of prickly and cool in a geeky way. He makes his own action figures, distills his own bourbon (something Mavis especially appreciates) and has an awesome collection of \u201990s indie-rock T-shirts.\n\nHe is also a reminder of the brutal underside of high school, which Mavis chooses to remember as a time of power and glory. Back when she was prom queen, he was in the hospital, having survived a horrific beating that left permanent physical damage.\n\nAnd yet Mavis can look at him and complain, without irony, about how much she has suffered in her life. Her cruelty and self-pity are downright shocking. If Ms. Theron hadn\u2019t already appeared in a film called \u201cMonster\u201d (for which she won an Oscar), that title might suit \u201cYoung Adult\u201d just as well.\n\nBut even as this movie revels in the punitive spectacle of Mavis\u2019s humiliation, it also extends her a measure of sympathy. Not by justifying her appalling behavior, but rather by treating her honestly.\n\nPopular culture weaves a tapestry of beautiful lies. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d the Teenage Fanclub vocalist swears, over and over, in the chorus of \u201cThe Concept.\u201d The book Mavis is working on (we hear snippets in voice-over) is full of paeans to its heroine\u2019s pluck, luck and intelligence. Big-studio comedies lull us with smiles and fairy tales. The truth, in these circumstances, can be a painful shock, even when it makes you laugh.\n\n\u201cYoung Adult\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Harsh language, bad sex, unpleasant situations \u2014 grown-up stuff, in other words.\n\nOpens on Friday in Manhattan.\n\nDirected by Jason Reitman; written by Diablo Cody; director of photography, Eric Steelberg; edited by Dana Glauberman; production design by Kevin Thompson; costumes by David C. Robinson; produced by Mr. Reitman, Ms. Cody, Russell Smith, Lianne Halfon, John Malkovich and Mason Novick; released by Paramount Pictures.

    "text": "Despite bringing in a slew of younger players, the U.S. men\u2019s national soccer team will still have a few members who are somewhat long in the tooth for its home-and-home World Cup qualifying matches against Guatemala on Friday night and Tuesday.\n\nTim Howard, who is 37, should be back in goal. Midfielder Kyle Beckerman is 33 years old and still on the roster, and Clint Dempsey, who just turned 33, is back after being left off the roster for two qualifiers last November. Head coach Jurgen Klinsmann said the team needs Dempsey, who has 48 international goals, especially Friday night\u2019s match in Guatemala City, where a single goal could be the difference.\n\nIf history is a guide, that could be a tall order for a player of Dempsey\u2019s vintage. While he is second all-time on the U.S. men\u2019s scoring list and still probably has a few more goals in his boots, most of the country\u2019s other prolific scorers didn\u2019t notch many of their goals at Dempsey\u2019s age, or even after the age of 30.\n\nLandon Donovan, the U.S. team\u2019s all-time leading scorer with 57 goals, was finished at 32.

    "text": "The dead were buried on Monday, more than two dozen Christian Egyptian protesters mowed down by their own military, an army that had won praise back in February for refusing to turn its weapons on demonstrators. After Sunday night's violence, which left 24 dead and more than 270 wounded, according to the Egyptian Health Ministry, the Arab Spring seems a long time ago. A military council led by Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi is now in charge of Egypt, and it is resurrecting many of the tactics of deposed President Hosni Mubarak to instill fear and keep the citizenry in line, like using state TV to spread sectarian suspicion and conspiratorial talk of \"foreign hands\" sowing internal discord.\n\nSunday's march in Cairo by Coptic Christians \u0097 with a fair smattering of sympathetic Muslim participation as well \u0097 started out as a peaceful protest against the recent burning of a church by ultraconservative Muslims and the perceived lackadaisical response by the ruling military junta to a spate of anti-Christian attacks since Mubarak's ouster. Events rapidly devolved into chaos, with live ammunition fired, clouds of tear gas released and protesters crushed and killed by military vehicles that reportedly rammed into them. Some protesters responded by throwing rocks. (See pictures of the Coptic Christians' march in Cairo.)\n\nState TV had another narrative: a violent mob of Christians sparked the melee by attacking the military, killing several soldiers. Breathless anchors urged \"honorable\" citizens to head down along the Nile to the national media building at Maspero to help soldiers defend themselves and public property. The clashes reignited on Monday, when Christians pelted security forces with rocks outside the Cairo hospital where the bodies of victims were taken the previous night. The Coptic church on Monday disputed state TV's claims, saying there was no evidence that Christian protesters shot at soldiers. Church officials called for a three-day fast to protest the events.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood's Essam el-Erian condemns the violence, telling TIME that this is a critical period for the country, a \"time for solidarity, to implement a state of law, and to make reconciliation between all sections of society.\"\n\nEgypt's Christians, who make up about 10% of the country's 80 million or so people, have watched warily as Salafists and other ultraconservative Muslims, long kept underfoot by Mubarak, have begun exercising their political rights \u0097 and influence \u0097 in the wake of the February revolution. At 8 million or so, Egypt's Copts are easily one of the biggest Christian communities in the Middle East, but unlike the much smaller Christian population in Lebanon, for example, they lack political muscle. (Lebanon is the only country in the Middle East with a Christian head of state mandated by political consensus.) (See TIME's exclusive pictures of the turmoil in Egypt.)\n\nIt's a trying period for the Middle East's dwindling Christian communities as secular pan-Arab, anti-Islamist regimes fall by the wayside and leave political vacuums in their place. The precedent of Iraq looms large. There were some 800,000 Christians in the country before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 toppled Saddam Hussein. Since then, hundreds of thousands have fled the war-ravaged state. In majority-Sunni Syria, the minority Christians have largely sided with Bashar Assad's brutal regime in public, fearful of what may follow it, although many prominent Christians are also part of the opposition. \"This is a dangerous period, one that will determine in which direction the country is going,\" says Emad Gad, a Copt and leader of the Egyptian Social Democratic party. \"Are we taking the first steps toward creating a real state or are we going toward sectarian conflict and war?\"\n\nSunday's violence in Cairo has significance beyond the country's religious divisions. This is a wider conflict in which Egyptians of all religions are turning against a military regime that just eight months ago was hailed for ensuring a peaceful transfer of power after Mubarak was forced from office. The fruits of Egypt's revolution have yet to be savored by millions who hoped a quick revolution would bring even quicker economic, social and political benefits. The economy has slumped, and the generals \u0097 who initially pledged to hand back power to a civilian administration in six months \u0097 seem increasingly comfortable at the helm. Their recently announced electoral timetable would keep them in charge until presidential elections in 2013, much to the ire of many. \"I don't think we'll have elections at all,\" Gad says, echoing a sentiment relayed on Twitter and other social media. \"I think that the army let the violence happen so that it could cancel the elections and remain in power.\"\n\nThe Brotherhood's el-Erian warns against any delay to the elections. \"We cannot move forward without elections,\" he tells TIME. \"We can overcome all of these trials with solidarity and national consensus ... The people are waiting for elections and to have a new system.\"\n\nAs the exuberance of Arab Spring becomes a faraway memory in the Middle East, a counterrevolution is gaining ground, exploiting the sectarianism that power brokers in the region have long used to keep their populations at bay. Will Egyptians and other Arabs see through it? Or will they be sucked into its vortex? What happens next on Cairo's streets will be critical.\n\nSee more international news on TIME's blog Global Spin.",

Military planes were to airlift people from the base to cities in Florida. Family pets will join the mandatory evacuations, base officials said.\n\nThose getting evacuated are mostly nonessential personnel. There are no plans to evacuate the\n\n\"Remaining personnel and their families will be taking shelter in their homes or designated locations,\" base officials said.\n\nIt's unclear when the evacuees will be brought back, officials said.\n\nIn the next few days, Matthew is expected to dump 15 to 25 inches of rain on southern Haiti, with as much as 40 inches in some areas, the National Weather service said.\n\nEastern Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and eastern Cuba will get pummeled with as much as 25 inches in some areas.\n\nMatthew briefly strengthened Friday night into a Category 5 storm, becoming the strongest hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Felix in 2007. But it is now a Category 4 storm, meaning it carries winds between 130 and 156 mph (209 to 251 kph).\n\n\"Some fluctuations in intensity are possible this weekend, but Matthew is expected to remain a powerful hurricane through Monday,\" the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nIn Jamaica, storm shelters opened as the nation braced for its first major hurricane since Gilbert in 1988.\n\nMarcia Forbes, a business owner in Kingston, told CNN she was preparing for a rough couple of days.\n\nShe waited in line to fill her car with gasoline, brought in her potted plants and filled her bathtub with water in case service gets interrupted during the storm. She also placed sandbags against the shutters of her multimedia company and covered her office computers with plastic.\n\n\"Having lived through Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, I know what a Category 3 hurricane can do, (much) less a Category 4 or 5,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"Everyone in my community is taking this hurricane seriously and getting their homes shuttered up.\"\n\nAfter pummeling Jamaica and Haiti, Matthew could slam Cuba, the Bahamas and South Florida later this week, forecasters said.\n\nAlthough weather models show the outskirts of Matthew just scraping the southern part of Florida, Rick Knabb, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, urged Floridians to prepare and buy supplies.\n\nJamaica Prime Minister Andrew Holness told journalists that while the hurricane posed a great risk to lives and property that it could also blow the economy off course,\n\n\"The biggest concern is the impact on the economy. ... This weather event could derail our economic program,\" the newspaper quoted Holness as saying Saturday while touring areas that could be most affected by Matthew. \"We are ensuring that all government agencies understand that they have a role in the speedy recovery. That speedy recovery will ensure that our economy does not suffer unnecessarily.\"\n\n\"Of course, on a local level, community level, we expect that we will see significant damage to property and dislocation and human suffering that will come from such an event if we do not prepare. It could be significant.\"\n\nIBC Airways has canceled all flights Monday to and from Guantanamo Bay because of the approaching storm.\n\n, JetBlue, Spirit Airlines and Fly Jamaica Airways issued travel warnings for their customers, saying change fees may be waived for flights to some destinations.\n\nThe US State Department issued a travel warning Sunday, urging citizens in Haiti to leave quickly if they can.\n\n\"Given the approaching hurricane, there is limited time available for a safe departure,\" the State Department said.\n\n\"We recommend US citizens depart Haiti if possible and work with commercial air carriers to leave prior to the arrival of the hurricane. Airports will close once conditions deteriorate and safe travel is not possible. \"\n\nCNN's Joe Sterling, Joe Sutton, Steve Visser and Lindy Royce contributed to this report.",

    "text": "On some college campuses, students are agitated about the presence of Chick-fil-A, a purveyor of Southern-style chicken sandwiches that has run afoul of some proponents of same-sex marriage. But at a New York University cafeteria, the only place in the city where a craving for Chick-fil-A can be sated, the squawking has been limited.\n\nSome N.Y.U. students have complained to the university\u2019s Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Student Center, said John Beckman, a university spokesman. And a Facebook group Remove Chick-fil-A from NYU (and thus NYC!) is up and running.\n\nBut so far, the food court in Weinstein Hall continues to serve the chain\u2019s fried-chicken nuggets, sandwiches and waffle fries, he said.\n\nElsewhere, gay-rights advocates have stoked opposition to Chick-fil-A since one of its outlets in Pennsylvania lent support to marriage seminars, scheduled for next week, that were arranged by a group that has been outspoken against same-sex marriage. At Indiana University\u2019s campus in South Bend, a student group persuaded the university to ban Chick-fil-A products briefly. On Monday, that university\u2019s chancellor invited Chick-fil-A to return to campus on Wednesday.\n\nThe president of Chick-fil-A, Dan Cathy, has said that the company was not endorsing the seminars, merely providing food at them.\n\nAt N.Y.U., JJ Bishop-Boros, a member and former officer of the university\u2019s Queer Union, said the group had decided against pressing a boycott \u201cthat focuses only on Chick-fil-A and gay marriage.\u201d Instead, he said, Queer Union hopes to meet with other campus groups to examine the practices of each food distributor on campus, from the wages they pay workers to environmental issues.\n\n\u201cIf we only criticize Chick-fil-A, we\u2019re almost justifying other businesses\u2019 practices,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be hypocritical.\u201d\n\nIn the dining hall, students who were lined up for Chick-fil-A food said they were unaware of the controversy.\n\n\u201cChick-fil-A\u2019s great, and it\u2019s the only one in New York City, which makes it even cooler,\u201d said Morgan Ingari, a sophomore, as she reached for a bag of waffle fries.\n\nBut behind her, J. P. Borum, a writing professor who was making her first foray to Chick-fil-A, reversed course after hearing about the flap. \u201cI\u2019m gay and Episcopal,\u201d she said, opting instead for a salad from another station. She said she had \u201cnever heard a peep about this from students.\u201d\n\nAt N.Y.U., the complaints have not been brought to the university senate for discussion, Mr. Beckman said. He said that the products of another Atlanta-based company, Coca-Cola, had been banned from campus for a few years after students protested against the company\u2019s labor practices.\n\nThe station serving Chick-fil-A\u2019s food has been a popular part of a food court in the dining hall on University Place in Manhattan since the fall of 2004, Mr. Beckman said. Chick-fil-A won out in a student taste test when the dining hall was being revamped by its operator, Aramark, he said.\n\nMr. Beckman said the food court was open only to students and others with university identification cards, but as food bloggers have written, this policy does not seem to be heavily enforced, and on some food-oriented Web sites like Yelp.com, outsiders have shared tales of their incursions spurred by serious cravings for fried chicken and pickles on a buttered bun.\n\n\u201cThank God for this hidden treasure!\u201d one reviewer wrote on Yelp. \u201cYes it\u2019s in an N.Y.U. dining hall. But if you feel too weird eating with students you can get plastic bag and take it to Washington Square Park.\u201d",

    "text": "(CHICAGO) \u2014 The white officer who shot a black Chicago teen 16 times has been charged with murder and jailed. The graphic video of the slaying has been made public. And in the hours after the footage was released, protesters seemed to honor pleas for restraint.\n\nThe question now is whether those efforts will be enough to address the simmering resentment that authorities took more than a year to share the footage and charge the officer who emptied an entire magazine into the teen even after he had crumpled to the ground.\n\nCity officials and community leaders had long braced for the release of the dash-cam video showing the death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. They feared the kind of turmoil that occurred in cities such as Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, after young black men were slain by police or died in police custody.\n\nA judge ordered that the recording be made public by Wednesday. Moments before it was released, the mayor and the police chief urged protesters to stay calm.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel said residents will \u201chave to make an important judgment about our city and ourselves and go forward.\u201d He referred to the episode as a potential \u201cmoment of understanding and learning.\u201d\n\nProtest groups are expected to stage more demonstrations in the days ahead, including one at City Hall scheduled for Wednesday and another seeking to block Michigan Avenue during Friday\u2019s holiday shopping bonanza.\n\nAmong the protesters was Justin Taylor, an 18-year-old University of Iowa student who returned home to Chicago for Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s powerful we\u2019re coming together,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThings like this happen too often.\u201d\n\nThe relevant portion of the video runs for less than 40 seconds and has no audio.\n\nMcDonald swings into view on a four-lane street where police vehicles are stopped in the middle of the roadway. As he jogs down an empty lane, he appears to pull up his pants and then slows to a brisk walk, veering away from two officers who are emerging from a vehicle and drawing their guns.\n\nAlmost immediately, one of the officers appears to fire from close range. McDonald spins around and collapses on the pavement.\n\nThe car with the camera continues to roll forward until the officers are out of the frame. Then McDonald can be seen lying on the ground, moving occasionally. At least two small puffs of smoke are seen coming off his body as the officer continues firing.\n\nIn the final moments, an officer kicks something out of McDonald\u2019s hands.\n\nPolice have said the teen had a knife. Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Anita Alvarez said Tuesday that a 3-inch knife with its blade folded into the handle was recovered from the scene.\n\nShortly after the video\u2019s release, protesters began marching through city streets. Several hundred people blocked traffic on the near West Side. Some circled police cars in an intersection and chanted \u201c16 shots.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators, at times numbering in the hundreds, streamed through streets in the downtown and near South Side areas, gathering at one point outside the police department\u2019s District 1 headquarters.\n\nLater, along Michigan Avenue, at least one person was detained, which led to a tense moment as protesters tried to prevent police from taking him away. Some threw plastic water bottles at officers and sat behind a police vehicle, refusing to move. Officers pulled them away, and the vehicle sped off.\n\nThe biggest group had mostly dissipated by 11 p.m., with a few dozen returning to the District 1 building. Another group of at least 50 people briefly blocked a busy expressway before walking toward a lakefront park.\n\nBefore the release of the video, city officials spent months arguing that the footage could not be made public until the conclusion of several investigations. After the judge\u2019s order, the investigations were quickly wrapped up and a charge announced.\n\nAlvarez said concern about the impending release prompted her to move up the announcement of the murder charge.\n\n\u201cIt is graphic. It is violent. It is chilling,\u201d she said. \u201cTo watch a 17-year-old young man die in such a violent manner is deeply disturbing. I have absolutely no doubt that this video will tear at the hearts of all Chicagoans.\u201d\n\nBut she also defended the 13 months it took to charge Officer Jason Van Dyke, insisting that she made a decision \u201cweeks ago\u201d to charge him and the video\u2019s ordered release did not influence that.\n\nSome community leaders questioned that assertion.\n\n\u201cThis is a panicky reaction to an institutional crisis within the criminal justice system,\u201d said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said he hoped to see \u201cmassive\u201d but peaceful demonstrations.\n\nMonths after McDonald\u2019s death, the city agreed to a $5 million settlement with his family, even before relatives filed a lawsuit, a move that also drew deep skepticism from the community.\n\nAt the time of McDonald\u2019s death, police were responding to complaints about someone breaking into cars and stealing radios.\n\nVan Dyke, who was denied bond on Tuesday, was the only officer of the several who were on the scene to open fire.\n\nAlvarez said the officer was on the scene for just 30 seconds before he started shooting. She said he opened fire just six seconds after getting out of his vehicle and kept firing even though McDonald dropped to the ground after the initial shots.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Bill Delaney said the shooting lasted 14 or 15 seconds and that McDonald was on the ground for 13 of those seconds.\n\nAn autopsy report showed that McDonald was shot at least twice in his back and PCP, a hallucinogenic drug, was found in his system.\n\nVan Dyke\u2019s attorney, Dan Herbert, maintains his client feared for his life and acted lawfully and that the video does not tell the whole story.\n\nAfter the shooting, Van Dyke was stripped of his police powers and assigned to desk duty.\n\nHerbert said the case needs to be tried in a courtroom and \u201ccan\u2019t be tried in the streets, can\u2019t be tried on social media and can\u2019t be tried on Facebook.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writers Sophia Tareen, Michael Tarm and Carla K. Johnson contributed to this report.",

Apollo and Metropoulos would assume the lead position in the asset auction, brought on by Hostess\u2019 latest bankruptcy, according to Reuters. As stalking-horse bidders, Apollo and Metropoulos can make the first offer and set a floor. Another acquirer can beat them with a higher offer, but Apollo and Metropoulos would then receive a break-up fee.\n\nBehind Apollo Global Management: billionaire banker Leon Black. After decades in the game, Forbes valued his fortune at $3.5 billion last September, making him among the wealthiest in America and No. 113 on the latest Forbes 400. Past deals include investments in Claire\u2019s, Caesars Entertainment Corp. and Realogy.\n\nAnother billionaire, C. Dean Metropoulos, runs the other interested firm. Metropoulos is slightly lower profile than Black. Less wealthy too. Forbes estimated his fortunate at $1.2 billion, No. 360 on Forbes 400. Metropoulos, though, made a splash recently with the purchase of Pabst Blue Ribbon, the largest privately held U.S. brewer, and a new favorite, if ironic, tipple for many.\n\nThese two American billionaires seem to have a leg up on another billionaire-backed company from south of the border. Grupo Bimbo, the world\u2019s largest breadmaker, is run by a billionaire Mexican family and was sweet on Hostess in the past. Bimbo, of course, still could enter a bid that tops the Apollo-Metropoulos offer.\n\nOther companies reportedly interested in the asset sale include Wal-Mart and Kroger.

He was doing so on behalf of his favored candidate, Sanders.\n\nThe hip-hop star cut a distinctive figure in a black sweatshirt, surrounded by the standard-issue blue or grey suits worn by professional political operatives.\n\nBut he had enough passion in him to match all the campaign apparatchiks in the room.

Speaking to season ticket holders Tuesday night at Verizon Center, answering a fan\u2019s question about bringing the All-Star game here, deputy commissioner Bill Daly offered an encouraging response.\n\n\u201cI would say, in the foreseeable future, yes,\u201d Daly said.\n\nOnly the next two hosts have been announced: Columbus hosts on Jan. 25, 2015, and Nashville on Jan. 31, 2016. And though all administrative attention will be focused on the Winter Classic this month, Daly hinted that, once the rink gets dismantled at Nationals Park and Jan. 2 rolls around, he expects some moves from Capitals owner Ted Leonsis.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t at this point,\u201d Daly said, when asked if the NHL had a timetable for awarding Washington D.C. an All-Star game. \u201cWe do have \u2014 the way we do the All-Star game is we put it out for applications to the member clubs. This organization historically was focused on the Winter Classic and getting the Winter Classic. I think once we have a successful event on Jan. 1, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll turn to the next event that they want. I have no doubt the All-Star Game will be in line soon.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, the focus remains on New Years\u2019 Day. Epix will arrive at Kettler Capitals Iceplex to set up Wednesday, then start their all-access, behind-the-scenes look later this week. Ten of Washington\u2019s remaining 13 games this month will be spent on the road. Then, after visiting the Islanders on Dec. 29, the Capitals will return home and start skating outside.\n\n\u201cI think the league generally, not just me, is excited for the event,,\u201d Daly said. \u201cWe always are. It\u2019s probably the most anticipated date on the NHL regular season calendar. It\u2019s become that. I think all eyes are going to be on the nation\u2019s capital on Jan. 1. We\u2019ve been able to carve out a unique niche on that day, kind of our own little window where we have national prominence. That itself is pretty exciting.\u201d\n\nAs for this year\u2019s All-Star game, only forward Alex Ovechkin ranked among the top 40 forwards, top 30 defensemen and top 10 goaltenders after the second week of fan voting, according to the NHL. Ovechkin\u2019s 54,319 votes puts him at 17th for his position.\n\nAlex Prewitt covers the Washington Capitals. Follow him on Twitter",

But slowly the demonization of Jews started to come back,\" Lauder said. \"Once again, young Jewish boys are afraid to wear yarmulkes on the streets of Paris and Budapest and London. Once again, Jewish businesses are targeted. And once again, Jewish families are fleeing Europe.\"\n\nThe recent attack in Paris, in which four Jews were killed in a kosher supermarket, is not the first deadly attack on Jews in recent years. Last May a shooting killed four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels and in 2012 a rabbi and three children were murdered in the French city of Toulouse.\n\nEurope also saw a spasm of anti-Semitism last summer during the war in Gaza, with protests in Paris turning violent and other hostility across the continent.\n\n\"This vilification of Israel, the only Jewish state on earth, quickly became an opportunity to attack Jews,\" Lauder said. \"Much of this came from the Middle East, but it has found fertile ground throughout the world.\"\n\nOne Holocaust survivor, Roman Kent, became emotional as he issued a plea to world leaders to remember the atrocities and fight for tolerance.\n\n\"We do not want our past to be our children's future,\" the 85-year-old said to applause, fighting back tears and repeating those words a second time.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama, who was in Saudi Arabia to pay respects after the death of King Abdullah, issued a statement paying tribute to the 6 million Jews and millions of others murdered by the Nazis.\n\n\"The recent terrorist attacks in Paris serve as a painful reminder of our obligation to condemn and combat rising anti-Semitism in all its forms, including the denial or trivialization of the Holocaust,\" Obama said.\n\nThe commemorations in Poland, which during World War II was under Nazi occupation, were also marked by a melancholy awareness that it will be the last major anniversary that a significant number of survivors will be strong enough to attend.\n\n\"The survivors are completely gutted that in their lifetime they went through what they went through and that now they are at the end of their life and they don't know what kind of world they are leaving for their grandchildren,\" said Stephen Smith, executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation. \"That is very disappointing for them. We have let them down.\"\n\nPolitics also cast a shadow on the event, with Russian President Vladimir Putin absent -- even though the Soviet Red Army liberated the camp -- the result of the deep chill between the West and Russia over Ukraine.\n\nAmong those in attendance were French President Francois Hollande, who has vowed to fight the violent extremism that has wounded his nation, as well as the presidents of Germany and Austria, the perpetrator nations that have spent decades atoning for their sins.\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko was also there in a sign of Poland's strong support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.\n\nPoland apparently snubbed Putin, though officials don't say that openly. The organizers, the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum and the International Auschwitz Council, opted for a form of protocol this year that avoided direct invitations by Poland's president to his foreign counterparts. The organizers instead simply asked countries that are donors to Auschwitz, including Russia, whom they planned to send. Poland's Foreign Ministry says Putin could have attended if he wished.\n\nThe Russian delegation was led by Sergei Ivanov, Putin's chief of staff.\n\nThe public spat comes at a low point in relations between Russia and the West, following Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, and its support for the rebel forces battling Kiev's troops in eastern Ukraine. Poland has been one of Europe's most vocal countries in condemning Russia's actions in Ukraine, which has plunged the continent into one of the worst East-West crises since the end of the Cold War.\n\nSome of the survivors said they thought Putin should have been there, given the fact that the Soviet liberated the camp and that Russia is the successor state to the Soviet Union.\n\nNatan Grossmann, a survivor who now lives in Munich, also feels Putin should have been invited.\n\n\"They put their lives on the line to free us. They lost their lives and we should honor them,\" Grossmann said.\n\nAt the United Nations, commemorations planned for Tuesday, which is International Holocaust Remembrance Day, were canceled because of a snowstorm in New York.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin had been scheduled to speak along with the head of Yad Vashem, Avner Shalev. It has tentatively been rescheduled for Wednesday, depending on the weather.",

    "text": "Jabari Parker (center) and his family connected with Duke and coach Mike Krzyzewski during their official visit earlier this fall.\n\nCourtesy of the Parker Family.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon Jabari Parker, one of the top basketball players in the country out of Simeon High in Chicago, announced on national television that he will attend Duke. Parker agonized over the decision for months and he still wasn't completely sure what he was going to do a day before the announcement. But after a furious final push from recruiters this week, Parker was at peace with his decision by last night. Before going to bed at 12:15 this morning he affirmed his choice with his brother Christian and his parents. But he didn't inform any of the coaches at his five schools.\n\nIn May Sports Illustrated profiled Parker, a devout Mormon, and put him on the cover. Parker has been under an intense microscope ever since, and over the last several months offered SI a behind-the-scenes look at his recruitment.\n\nIt started with a tweet at 4:29 p.m. on July 11 when Parker announced his 10 finalists: \"UK, Stanford, Michigan State, Kansas, Florida, Duke, BYU, Georgetown, DePaul, UNC. No order.\" Through Parker didn't indicate a frontrunner, speculation was rampant that Kentucky had the inside track.\n\nAnthony Davis and Derrick Rose, the two biggest talents to come out of Chicago in recent years, had both played one season under John Calipari. Both then jumped to the NBA and were the No. 1 pick in the draft. Parker knows and respects both players, and Calipari had made it clear that he wanted Parker badly. When Jabari's father, Sonny, called Calipari to congratulate him after winning the NCAA championship last spring, Calipari said: \"I want to coach Jabari.\"\n\nBut the question was, what did Jabari want? He ended up having a lot more time to consider the question than he had anticipated. In June Parker fractured his foot while playing for USA Basketball in the Under-17 World Championship tournament. It put him out of action until a couple weeks ago.\n\n\"In one respect, my injury helped me a lot,\" said Parker. \"Being sidelined gave me the opportunity to think through my decision and weigh my options more carefully. It also humbled me more and forced me to reexamine my priorities.\"\n\nDuring the summer, Parker also changed his phone number after the NCAA announced new rules enabling coaches to make unlimited calls and text messages to high school seniors. Parker's parents informed recruiters that they would have to go through them if they wanted access to Jabari. Off the court and insulated from outside influences, Parker began charting an unusual course in selecting a school. The decision was going to boil down to character and credibility.\n\n\"I decided I wanted to play for someone I admired, someone that could help me reach my basketball goals and my long-term goals,\" Parker said. \"I was looking for someone I could look up to, someone that could teach me the game, as well as what's most important in life.\"\n\nBy the end of the summer, Parker had trimmed his list of schools to eight, scratching Kentucky and Georgetown. Coaches from the remaining schools began making in-home visits at the start of the school year. Tom Izzo and Billy Donovan both spent more than three hours in Parker's home. By the time they left, Parker was enthusiastic about the prospect of playing for either of them. So were his parents.\n\n\"Coach Izzo is like us,\" Sonny Parker said. \"He's blue collar and his demeanor is reflected in the way he coaches. He has a great rapport with his players and they work very hard for him.\"\n\nDonovan had a different appeal -- experience as a collegiate and NBA player. \"He has played the game at every level,\" Sonny said. \"It gives him the ability to relate to young players in a unique way. And he's a proven winner.\"\n\nKrzyzewski made his in-home visit on Sept. 21. That marked a turning point in Jabari's decision-making process. Krzyzewski was the only one who spent much of his visit on his feet. \"He was so animated,\" said Jabari's mother, Lola. \"There were moments when he was so passionate that he couldn't sit down.\"\n\nThat was especially the case when Krzyzewski broke down Duke's offense for Jabari. For each play, Coach K demonstrated precisely the proper position of Jabari's feet and hands, as well as the direction and angle of Jabari's body. He repeated this when going through Duke's defenses. Parker felt like he was at a clinic.\n\nKrzyzewski also talked about coaching the Olympic team. Parker was familiar with the fact that Olympians LeBron James and Kobe Bryant have both indicated that if they'd gone to college they would have chosen Duke. But it was something Krzyzewski said at the end of his visit that impacted Parker the most. \"Jabari, a good name is better than anything you can achieve in this life,\" he told him.\n\nAfter Krzyzewski's visit, Jabari's older brother, Christian, tried to help Jabari narrow his decision.\n\n\"If there was one coach you could play for, who would it be?\" he said.\n\n\"Well he's no longer here. So who is your second choice?\"\n\n\"There is only person now that is close to him. Coach K.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the in-home visits, Parker trimmed his list of schools to five: Duke, Michigan State, Florida, Stanford and BYU. The first three were no surprise. But Stanford and BYU raised some eyebrows. Stanford had two draws, starting with coach Johnny Dawkins. Parker respects Dawkins, relates to him and loves his approach to the game. Stanford's academic reputation was the other plus. A national honor society student with a 3.7 GPA, Parker is serious about obtaining a degree and he'd like it to come from a prestigious university.\n\nIn the case of BYU, it was widely assumed that Parker's Mormon faith was the primary pull. But that was a non-factor. BYU was on the list for one reason -- assistant coach Mark Pope. A former captain of Kentucky's 1996 national championship team who played in the NBA, Pope immediately bonded with Parker. It got to a point where Parker felt close enough to play practical jokes on Pope during unofficial visits to BYU.\n\n\"Pope is one of my favorite coaches in the country,\" Jabari said. \"He was the reason I was interested in BYU.\"\n\nIn October, Parker set up official campus visits to the five schools. Before making the first trip to Michigan State, Parker and his brother Christian made two lists. One had the five schools. The other had Jabari's top five priorities in selecting a school: Coach, Academics, Environment (social), Basketball (team chemistry and style of play) and Spirituality.\n\nThen Jabari selected the schools that best fit his priorities:\n\nCoach: Duke Academics: Duke/Stanford Basketball: Michigan State Environment: Duke Spirituality: Undecided\n\nJabari Parker has won three consecutive state titles at Chicago's Simeon High, the same school where Derrick Rose was a star.\n\nLeaning heavily toward Duke, Parker set out on his official campus visits. The trips to Michigan State and Florida complicated things. The minute he arrived in East Lansing, Parker felt like he was among family. A tight bunch, Michigan State players welcomed Parker and assured him that he would love Izzo's tough, aggressive style of play. Meantime, Izzo and his staff took Jabari to a Mormon Church service held at a local congregation near campus. It was about the same size as his congregation in Chicago and Parker felt right at home. The more time Parker spent around Izzo the more he knew he'd love to play for him.\n\n\"I thought it was great that Coach Izzo went to church with me,\" Parker said. \"Pretty unique.\"\n\nFlorida's Donovan didn't take Parker to church, but one of his assistants did. However, Parker got a lot of one-on-one time with Donovan while on the Florida campus and he learned a lot more about his priorities as a father and a husband. \"He's a great family man,\" Parker said. \"The way he is with his children really got my attention.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Parker's father was diagnosed with a kidney ailment and has been undergoing dialysis three times a week. When the Parkers visited Duke, Krzyzewski made arrangements for Sonny to visit a dialysis center on campus -- not exactly a typical stop on a recruiting trip. Jabari is very close to his parents and his father's heath situation could limit Sonny's ability to travel to Jabari's games, a factor that had weighed so heavily on Jabari's mind that at one point he seriously considered just playing in Chicago.\n\n\"They really did their homework,\" Jabari said of Duke. \"It meant a lot to me that they took my dad to a dialysis center. They knew how important this was to me and my family.\"\n\nKrzyzewski is also pretty familiar with the Mormon faith. In addition to previously coaching LDS student-athletes in the past, Krzyzewski's team physician is a Mormon who holds a leadership position in one of the congregations in Durham. He and Krzyzewski have worked together for 15 years.\n\nOn Thanksgiving weekend, Parker made his official visit to BYU. It was the only visit where his brother Christian, who attends the school, accompanied him. By the time Parker arrived in Provo he had decided that Michigan State, Florida and Duke were equally capable of providing the spiritual connection he needed.\n\nAccustomed to being the only Mormon in a very large urban high school, Parker felt at home at each of the campus congregations he visited and he liked the fact that his coaches made a point to connect him with local Mormons. It enabled him to fill in the final category on his chart -- Spirituality: Duke/Michigan State/Florida.\n\nYet, while attending a game at BYU, Parker visualized what it would be like to wear a Cougar uniform. \"Being at that game was one of the best experiences I have had at a college game,\" Parker said. \"It was like a dream. I was sitting in the stands and the crowd was shouting my name and I wasn't even playing.\"\n\nParker loved BYU's up-tempo offense, too. \"I love the way they get the ball up,\" he said. \"There would be lots of shot attempts there.\"\n\nBut Parker kept going back to his two lists. In the final analysis, every time he stacked the schools up against his five priorities, the answer was Duke.\n\n\"I would love to be on the same campus with Jabari and have it just like when we were growing up,\" Christian said. \"But Jabari needs to be where he can best develop his basketball talent. For him, choosing a school is a long-term investment. And there's no place like Duke.\"\n\nLola and Sonny Parker made a point not to push Jabari toward a particular school or coach. \"We've raised Jabari to make choices,\" Lola said. \"Sonny has played this game and he could easily put his foot down and tell Jabari what he ought to do. But Sonny hasn't done that. We've just repeatedly told Jabari to make the right choice for him.\"\n\nIn early December, when Christian came home from college, Jabari told him that he wanted to go to Duke. A week ago he informed his parents and his high school coach, Robert Smith, that he would make his announcement on Thursday. That touched off a final push from Duke, Michigan State, Florida and BYU. Jabari and his parents fielded more than 100 telephone calls and text messages in a four-day span. Pope flew in from Utah to visit Parker at home on Sunday. Donovan came in on Monday. Krzyzewski spent Tuesday evening at Parker's house. The last thing Krzyzewski said to Parker was, \"I believe in you, Jabari.\" And Izzo met with Parker at his high school on Wednesday.\n\nThe decision on which school to attend has been gut-wrenching for Parker. He felt a strong connection to all five of his final schools and didn't want to disappoint four of the coaches. After Krzyzewski left Parker's house on Tuesday, Jabari and Christian had a heart-to-heart. Christian then quoted a verse from Matthew 7:16: \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" Jabari paused and felt at peace with his decision when Christian said, \"Coach K can show you the fruit.\"",

    "text": "(SportsNetwork.com) - Playoff football is back in Big D.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys knew it would happen before the season began by boldly sending out postseason packages to their season-ticket holders last summer.\n\nIt's unknown if Nostradamus had something to do with Dallas' audacious prediction to reach the postseason, but the Cowboys know they will have their hands full with the Detroit Lions Sunday in an NFC Wild Card Game.\n\nDallas captured the NFC East title and the third seed in the conference with a 12-4 record and are in the playoffs for the first time since winning the division in 2009. Cowboys quarterback and MVP candidate Tony Romo has only one playoff victory under his belt and looks to build on that.\n\n\"I'm playing at a level I'm proud of and hope to get better,\" said Romo, who passed for 299 yards and two touchdowns with an interception in a 44-17 drubbing of Washington in the season finale. \"I'm just excited about the progression of improvement and want to keep this going in our next game.\"\n\nRomo passed for 3,705 yards, 34 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He is 1-3 as a starter in the playoffs, completing 80-of-1,235 passes for 832 yards, four TDs and two INTs. Now that the running game has hit full stride, Romo won't have to carry the offensive load. In four starts against the Lions, Romo is 1-3 with 1,160 yards, 10 TDs and four picks.\n\nIn seven home games this season, Romo passed for 1,772 yards, 14 touchdowns and was picked off seven times. He dealt with a lingering back issue all season, but has received treatment prior to the last few games to deaden the pain. Romo has built a strong rapport with leading receiver Dez Bryant, who led the team with 88 catches for 1,320 yards and a franchise-best 16 TDs.\n\nBryant had six touchdown receptions over the last three games for the Cowboys, who ripped off four straight wins after an embarrassing loss at home to the Philadelphia Eagles. Bryant is the only player in the NFL with 12 or more receiving touchdowns in each of the past three seasons, and has five touchdown catches in three meetings with Detroit.\n\n\"Dez is really a remarkable player,\" Cowboys tight end Jason Witten said. \"As a teammate, as a leader, as a veteran guy, you take a lot of pride in seeing the growth of Dez and (running back) DeMarco (Murray) mature as players. Dez is a unbelievable player, he's a dynamic player, and it's great to see his growth.\"\n\nThe Lions are in the playoffs for only the second time in the past 15 years and ended a two-year drought with an 11-5 record in the first year of head coach Jim Caldwell. The Lions just missed out on an NFC North title and the Green Bay Packers claimed it with a 12-4 mark.\n\nDetroit was hoping to close the regular season with five straight wins, but dropped a 30-20 decision to the Packers Sunday at Lambeau Field. Matthew Stafford passed for 217 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions for the Lions, whose 11 wins are the most since a 12-4 record back in 1991.\n\nStafford threw for 4,257 yards with 22 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, and has eclipsed the 4,000-yard passing mark for a fourth straight season. He is 2-0 in his career versus Dallas and lost his only playoff appearance to New Orleans in 2011, throwing for 380 yards, three TDs and two INTs in a 45-28 setback in the Big Easy.\n\nWide receiver Calvin Johnson is Stafford's main target and he had 211 yards and two scores on 12 receptions against the Saints.\n\nStafford is focused on winning his first playoff game.\n\n\"I think, obviously, you watch every game and find ways that you can get better, win, lose or draw,\" Stafford said. \"We're a battle-tested team and have won 11 football games this year. We found ways to win a lot of them and we'll continue to do that. We just have to move forward.\"\n\nGolden Tate, not Johnson, led Detroit with 99 receptions for 1,331 yards in his first year with the team, while Megatron grabbed a team-high eight touchdown receptions. Johnson missed three games because of injury.\n\nLions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh almost missed this playoff game against the Cowboys after he stepped on the legs of Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers while he was down on the grass. Suh was originally suspended for the game for violating playing rules prohibiting unnecessary roughness, but the penalty was reduced on appeal to a $70,000 fine.\n\nSuh paced the Lions with 8 1/2 sacks and is a vital piece to the stout run defense, which finished first in rushing yards allowed (69.3). The Lions were second in total defense and held opponents to 100 rushing yards or fewer in 14 of 16 games, including five games with 50 rushing yards or fewer.\n\nMurray led the NFL in rushing with a team-record 1,845 yards and 12 100-yard games. Murray was tied for the league lead in rushing scores with 13 and opened the season with eight straight 100-yard games for Dallas, which was second overall with 147.1 rushing yards per game.\n\n\"Controlling the line of scrimmage is important,\" Caldwell said. \"Our defense has been really strong in that area throughout the year.\"\n\nThe Lions defeated the Cowboys, 31-30, on Oct. 27, 2013 and were aided by Stafford's 488 passing yards. Johnson caught 14 passes for a franchise-record 329 yards and a score in that one for Detroit, which has won two in a row in this series after losing five of the previous six encounters.\n\nDetroit and Dallas have split two playoff matchups, while the Cowboys lead the overall series by a 13-12 margin.\n\nSunday's game features two great quarterbacks and two outstanding wide receivers. The Romo-to-Bryant connection has been on point the last few weeks and cannot afford to have a Thanksgiving flop. Romo threw for 199 yards and two interceptions, and was sacked twice in that Big D debacle\n\nBryant had 73 yards on six catches with no TDs. He has made great strides since that loss, however.\n\n\"We're just getting started and we're excited about the opportunity in front of us,\" Romo said about the postseason.\n\nRomo led the NFL with a club-record 113.2 passer rating. He has to be aware of Detroit defenders Suh, Ezekiel Ansah, George Johnson and DeAndre Levy. Levy led the Lions with 151 tackles, while Glover Quin snatched an NFL-best seven interceptions.\n\nDetroit had 20 INTs this season, second most in NFC. It will try to produce a few more turnovers and contain the likes of Bryant and Witten.\n\nThe Lions hope right guard Larry Warford will be available after he was carted off the field Sunday with a knee injury. Warford is day-to-day and hopes to be ready for the Cowboys.\n\n\"They haven't really told me what to say,\" Warford said. \"Can't say anything about the injury right now, but hopefully I'll be back soon.\"\n\nLions rookie center Travis Swanson made his first start in Green Bay and replaced suspended veteran Dominic Raiola.\n\nDallas had four players with 70 or tackles in Barry Church (97), Rolando McClain (81), Anthony Hitchens (75) and J.J. Wilcox (74). Bruce Carter recorded five interceptions and Wilcox had three.\n\nChurch and Wilcox will have to help over the top with corners Brandon Carr and Orlando Scandrick lining up against Johnson and Tate.\n\nThe Lions have it tough facing the Packers two times a season and were able to split the NFC North series with each team winning at home. The Cowboys are just as talented, and the Lions will have to enter Dallas' den in hopes of keeping the season alive.\n\nThe Cowboys were a perfect 8-0 on the road in the regular season and 4-4 at AT&T Stadium. The house that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones built will be electric this weekend, and getting Murray going early is priority No. 1. As difficult as that will be for Detroit to stop, there's Romo and Bryant to worry about.\n\n\"We have a great defense, they've held us in games a lot of times,\" Johnson said of Detroit's stop unit. \"Like they say, 'defense wins championships', so if we just step our game up on offense we'll be alright.\"\n\nDetroit is facing a fine collection of talent and will need a complete effort to pull off the victory. It won't happen this year, unfortunately, as Romo and the 'Boys ride off into the NFC divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nSports Network Predicted Outcome: Cowboys 34, Lions 26",

But as the Telegraph revealed earlier this year, families at the centre of the scandal are being sold \"faulty\" and potentially deadly models as replacements for up to \u00a399, or facing waits of up to 11 months for repairs as Whirlpool has not issued a full product recall.\n\nThe LGA warned that companies running lengthy repair programmes for potentially dangerous machines instead of recalling them are \"risking the lives of millions of customers\". It also called for all white goods to have fireproof markings on them which allow identification of the manufacturer, model and serial number.\n\nIt comes as the Retail Ombudsman, an arbiter of consumer disputes, has launched a service called \"UK Recall\" to allow customers to sign up for automatic alerts if one of their products is deemed faulty or unsafe.\n\nJeremy Hilton, chairman of the LGA's fire services management committee, said: \"People using faulty tumble dryers are unwittingly playing Russian roulette. Leading manufacturers need to recall affected models as soon as possible to protect their customers. \"Firefighters are attending tumble dryer fires three times a day, which is alarming. These defective products are endangering lives, causing thousands of pounds of damage to homes and making people homeless.\"\n\nThe LGA also warned that the machines should never be left on overnight, or while no-one is at home.",

    "text": "What\u2019s left of the Stewart hotel sits on a steep hill overlooking sheep-flecked fields, tumbling hedgerows and distant snow-capped mountains in Appin, west Scotland. Even in its prime, the 37-bedroom hotel would have been an eyesore, but now it\u2019s a wreck, the windows smashed, the roof collapsed by months of winter rain.\n\nJust a few years ago, hundreds of tourists passed through this hotel each summer, drawn by the natural beauty of the West Highlands. According to scathing reviews on TripAdvisor and other travel websites, the view was the only good thing about the hotel. Archived posts say the rooms were filthy, the taps broken, the food inedible. Many reviewers complain about the staff, describing them as overwhelmed, unskilled and incompetent.\n\nWhat the guests didn\u2019t know was that what they had experienced was not poor service, but modern slavery. The men making their beds, sweeping their floors, cleaning their dishes and cooking their food were trafficked from their native Bangladesh and exploited for profit at the Stewart hotel, sometimes for years at a time.\n\nNobody knows more about this than Abul Kamal Azad, 31, who spent more than a year working at the Stewart hotel between 2009-2010. A well-dressed and softly spoken man, what happened to him there has changed him for ever. \u201cThere are two people: who I was before I came here and what has become of me since,\u201d he says when we meet in a quiet restaurant in Fort William. \u201cI barely know who I am any more.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Azad left his wife and baby son in Bangladesh and flew to London, expecting to start work as a chef in a busy restaurant in the capital. When he called his new employer from the airport, he was told the plan had changed. He was to take a coach to Glasgow, then another bus to a place called Ballachulish in Lochaber in west Scotland.\n\nAs the bus left Glasgow and headed north, Azad stared out of the window in awe at the blue lochs and green hills. He waited to see another city emerge from the wilderness, but found himself going deeper and deeper into the countryside.\n\n\u201cIt was so beautiful but I thought, what is this place, where am I?\u201d Azad says. \u201cBefore I left my home I was told I was going to work in a busy place, a city with tall buildings everywhere.\u201d\n\nUsed to the clatter and commotion of Dhaka, he found the isolation disorienting. He was met by Shamsul Arefin, the man who had arranged for him to come to the UK, promising him a good job and a better life. Arefin drove him the last leg of the journey, and at last he found himself standing on the side of a hill in a remote corner of the Highlands, staring up at the dark windows of the hotel. He felt the first stirrings of fear.\n\n\u201cI felt completely alone,\u201d Azad says. \u201cI thought, where are the other workers? The guests? I realised it was only me. But I was here and I had to work.\u201d Over the coming months, Azad would find himself chained to the Stewart hotel by debt, isolation and the growing control of his employer.\n\nHe had first met 47-year-old Arefin six months earlier, after responding to an ad in a Dhaka paper offering jobs as a chef in the UK. Azad, the eldest of six sons, was struggling to earn a living working as a cook in his family\u2019s small restaurant in a suburb of Dhaka. He wanted more for his wife and young son; could this be a way out?\n\nThe advert led him to Arefin. A big man with a powerful voice, he exuded confidence and authority. His wife had important connections in Bangladeshi political circles and he owned a chain of businesses both there and in the UK, including the Stewart hotel. After their first meeting, he contacted Azad again and again, encouraging him to take a job. \u201cHe saw something, I don\u2019t know, some vulnerability,\u201d Azad says. \u201cHe was always calling me with promises,\u201d he says softly, looking at his hands.\n\nArefin showed Azad a work contract for \u00a318,000 a year as a tandoori chef, but told him he\u2019d need to pay up front for his Tier 2 sponsorship visa, which would allow him to work for up to five years in the UK. At first he asked for \u00a35,000. But as soon as Azad raised the money, he was told to find more. In the end, Azad borrowed \u00a315,000 from moneylenders and raised another \u00a35,000 selling his family land, his business and, finally, his wife\u2019s jewellery.\n\nAzad is embarrassed to talk about this. He knows it sounds foolish, naive, but back in Bangladesh, he says, you don\u2019t get anything for free. Besides, Arefin told him that once he came to the UK, with the salary he would be making, he\u2019d be able to pay off his debt in a year and still have two years left on his contract to earn more money than he would in a lifetime at home.\n\n\u201cHe had a contract and a visa, everything was official,\u201d Azad says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it could be abused. I showed it to my father and said, \u2018Give me a chance, I want to go. Here, you can see the contract. It is good pay, good working conditions, a proper salary.\u2019 Is it my fault for believing this?\n\n\u201cAll the time he [Arefin] gave me great hope. He said, \u2018What\u2019s your life like in Bangladesh? What is there for you? Think about your son.\u2019 I fell into his big hope trap. And I couldn\u2019t get out again.\u201d\n\nArefin, who was travelling back and forth between the UK and Bangladesh, arranged Azad\u2019s visa and travel documents. He was there when Azad arrived in Scotland, and told him he was the first worker to arrive: others would come.\n\nBut Azad spent months working as the sole employee in the Stewart hotel, cleaning, cooking, and gardening for up to 22 hours a day, seven days a week. After a few weeks, Azad asked for his wages and says Arefin grew angry, telling him he would be paid at the end of the month. The date came around, but his salary never appeared.\n\n\u201cI was the only worker for 37 bedrooms, I did everything. I woke every morning at 5am. Two coaches [of tourists] would arrive day after day.\u201d Locals would be hired but then leave almost immediately. \u201cNobody would stay and work for this man, but I had no choice. I thought, if I go back to my country, how will I pay my debt? My family depends on me. Every month I need to send money home.\u201d\n\nAfter three months, other Bangladeshi men began to arrive at the hotel, as startled and bewildered as Azad had been. Like him, all had been recruited by Arefin and had paid between \u00a315,000 and \u00a330,000 for a visa to work in the UK.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to [Arefin\u2019s] house in Dhaka, he was good to us, nice and polite. Now I know it is because he wanted our money,\u201d says Kamal Uddin Ahmed, 37, who arrived at the Stewart hotel from Bangladesh in July 2009. \u201cWhen I came to the UK he was different, he acted like the king and we were his slaves. The hotel was just one building and you couldn\u2019t see any other houses. There was nothing else there. I found it terrifying.\u201d\n\nAs time went on, Arefin\u2019s behaviour worsened. Despite their contracts, Azad and his co-workers say they were never paid more than \u00a3100 a month \u2013 just enough for them to send something to their families and keep believing they would eventually get their wages. \u201cJust little bits of money at a time,\u201d Azad explains. \u201cIn my country, the debt is increasing, the interest. It\u2019s a circle. I lost hope.\u201d\n\nThe men were tied to Arefin, their named sponsor, by the terms of their visa. He took their passports and threatened to report them as illegal workers if they complained. Azad says, \u201cHe would show us copies of our visa on his computer and say, \u2018Here is your name. I will cancel your sponsorship any time. This is my power.\u2019 I realised this is his business. It\u2019s like he purchased us, then used us as slaves.\u201d\n\nSheik Nasir Ullah Bhuiyan, a 38-year-old from Chittagong, Bangladesh, was another man Arefin trafficked to work at the Stewart hotel. \u201cWe worked from 5 o\u2019clock in the morning until after midnight every night,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to do everything, not only the kitchen, but housekeeping and cleaning, the toilets, outside, everything.\n\n\u201cWhen I confronted Arefin about the pay after months of work, he got very angry. He said, \u2018I am paying all the staff like that, you\u2019re not unique. If you don\u2019t like it, go to hell.\u2019 I\u2019d never been out of Bangladesh. I was afraid I would have no place to live.\u201d\n\nThe workers were too scared to talk to locals or guests about what was happening. \u201cHe told us, \u2018You can\u2019t talk to anybody. If you do, I will cancel your visa,\u2019\u201d Azad says. There was no mobile phone reception, no internet access and no transport. Arefin accompanied them whenever they went into town on hotel business. Some of the workers slept on the floor of empty rooms; others were forced to sleep in a decrepit caravan behind the hotel, with only slug-infested blankets for warmth. In the middle of winter, they were made to go outside in the freezing rain and snow to chop logs, wearing only the sandals they\u2019d brought with them from Bangladesh.\n\n\u201cThere was no hot water for us, no heating. In winter he allowed us to take a shower only once a week or once a month,\u201d Azad says. \u201cIt was so cold. The 12 of us shared one bathroom. In Bangladesh I lived in very good conditions. I had never faced anything like that in my life.\u201d\n\nAs the men grew more frantic, their exploitation became methodical and humiliating. Arefin physically abused and intimidated them, slapped their faces, threw burning oil at them in the kitchen and screamed that he would kill them. \u201cOne day he was pushing us, screaming and shouting, telling us to do this, do that,\u201d Ahmed says. \u201cWe never argued with him but he treated us like that anyway. I told him, \u2018I don\u2019t want to work for you, I want my money back.\u2019 He got so angry, I was afraid of what he would do.\u201d\n\nFor many of the men, who came from educated, hard-working, middle-class families in Bangladesh, being forced to beg for their pay and live in squalor had a profound psychological effect. \u201cIt affected me physically but it was more my mental health,\u201d Bhuiyan says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remember that man\u2019s face. I lost my confidence. I lost myself.\u201d\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they go to the police? Azad shakes his head. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d be deported with our debts unpaid.\u201d The moneylenders back in Bangladesh had started visiting the men\u2019s families, demanding repayments. \u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t know anything about the UK \u2013 where to go, what I should do, the rules, nothing.\u201d\n\nHe sits in silence for a moment. \u201cWe come from a poor and corrupt country, and I thought I was coming to seek a better life,\u201d he says angrily. \u201cWho does not want this?\u201d He had not entered the UK illegally; his one mistake was believing you had to pay for the chance of a better life. \u201cIf someone shows that you can have something for your future \u2013 some people might say it is greedy, but it is also very human.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 21 million people are trapped in some form of slavery around the world, trafficked into factories, building sites, hotels, fields and private homes. An estimated 13,000 of these are in the UK. Around 40% of people identified as trafficking victims in this country in the last year have been victims of forced labour, which has overtaken sex trafficking as the most prolific form of modern slavery in the UK.\n\n\u201cForced labour is so insidious because it can be invisible. At first sight, it can often look like ordinary work,\u201d says Kevin Hyland, the UK\u2019s first independent anti-slavery commissioner, pointing out that Azad and his co-workers\u2019 experience is increasingly common. Arefin, he says, \u201csaw that bringing people from the other side of the world and turning them into a source of free labour would make him more profit, regardless of the consequences to their lives\u201d.\n\nHundreds of tourists interacted with the men at the hotel, but few had any inkling what was going on. A tour operator who visited in 2012 tells us the hotel was staffed entirely by foreign workers who seemed like \u201czombies\u201d. She was horrified to learn the truth. \u201cAs soon as we got to the hotel it was clear there was something wrong; it was falling to pieces. And it was so remote: there was literally nowhere to go once your bus had driven away. We knew the owner had a terrible reputation. The staff seemed just out of it. It was probably the worst hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in.\u201d Tour groups used the hotel because it was the only one in the area, and gave great access to walking routes.\n\nAlyson Smith was one of the few local people who used the Stewart hotel\u2019s bar in the evening, coming in with her husband to drink and play pool. Over time she struck up a friendship with Azad, Ahmed, Bhuiyan and one other worker (who doesn\u2019t want to be identified). After a month or two they began to talk to her in whispers about what was happening to them.\n\n\u201cThey were always nervous,\u201d she says. \u201cIt slowly dawned on me that there was something seriously wrong, that they were asking for help.\u201d Years on, she still feels a deep sense of shame that she didn\u2019t see immediately what was happening.\n\nWhat did she make of Shamsul Arefin? Could she understand how these men could have been convinced into handing tens of thousands of pounds over to him, on the promise of a job?\n\n\u201cOh absolutely,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cHe was one of those people who could get you to do anything he wanted. He just oozed charm \u2013 he was so charismatic, but he could turn on a pin as well.\u201d\n\nHe even convinced Smith and her husband to work for him over a busy weekend. \u201cAnd then he didn\u2019t pay us. It was only when I threatened to go to the police that he gave us what he owed us.\u201d\n\nWhen she realised what was going on, Smith tried to contact the police, local media, politicians and the procurator fiscal. She says nobody did anything to help. \u201cI had no idea that stuff like this could happen in our community. Slavery, it\u2019s a big word. It\u2019s hard for people to accept that it was going on and nobody did anything to help.\u201d\n\nYet Smith\u2019s calls should have raised alarm bells instantly. It wasn\u2019t the first time Arefin had been linked to immigration abuses. In 2007 he was fined \u00a32,000 by Croydon crown court for illegally obtaining work permits for Indian and Bangladeshi restaurant employees. Even so, in 2009, he and his wife were granted a licence to run the Stewart hotel \u2013 against objections from the chief inspector of local police.\n\nOne day in August 2010, Azad and the other trafficked men saw that Arefin had left the hotel. Seizing this brief window of opportunity, they took the one bus to Fort William, walked into the local Citizens Advice bureau and asked for help. They returned to work and waited. A few weeks later the hotel was raided by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) and Arefin\u2019s sponsor licence was revoked.\n\nAzad was initially flooded with relief. \u201cAfter the raid I thought: God saved us. God sent someone. Something good is going to come of this.\u201d The men thought UKBA officials would force Arefin to give them their unpaid wages and treat them as legitimate workers. Instead they were told that their visas had been cancelled and they had 60 days to find another sponsor or be deported back to Bangladesh.\n\nIn the weeks after the raid, the men tried to find other jobs, but nobody was willing to sponsor them. Their desperation left them vulnerable; they say that more than one restaurant owner offered them a job, but only if they paid \u00a310,000 for sponsorship.\n\nWith Smith\u2019s help, the four men finally made contact with Migrant Help, a migrant rights NGO. Case worker Jim Laird arranged for them to board a train to Glasgow and met them at the station. \u201cWhen they arrived, they were in such a state,\u201d he says. \u201cThese were clearly people who\u2019d been labour trafficked. They\u2019d been given no help at all. The authorities just treated them like illegal workers.\u201d\n\nOver the following months, then years, Laird maintained a close relationship with the men. He first helped them find a safe house and temporary jobs, then worked to get them formally recognised as victims of trafficking by the UKBA. When the Home Office said they were allowed to stay in the UK on short-term temporary work visas if they agreed to testify as witnesses in a criminal investigation into Arefin and the Stewart hotel, Laird agreed to support them through the process.\n\nIt took five years for a criminal case against Arefin to come to trial. During this time Azad and the other men lurched from one temporary job to another, washing dishes or stacking shelves while the interest on their loans mounted at home.\n\nMeanwhile, though Arefin\u2019s sponsorship licence had been revoked, he remained free to run his business at the Stewart hotel while the procurator fiscal\u2019s office and the police decided whose job it was to investigate the case \u2013 a process that went on for two years.\n\nBy the time the case finally came to trial, all four men were destitute and suffering from severe stress disorders. They say their experience as witnesses in the trial further compounded their trauma; despite their trafficking status, they say they were given no advice or support. On multiple occasions the men travelled to the courthouse in Fort William only to be told that the trial date had changed. In open court, they were forced to give evidence, metres from their abuser.\n\n\u201cIt was terrible having to face him and relive what happened to us,\u201d Azad says. One of the other witnesses collapsed during questioning and had to be taken away in an ambulance. \u201cAnd all the time [Arefin] was sitting laughing at us.\u201d\n\nIn a written statement, the Lord Advocate\u2019s office in Scotland denies that the men were unsupported during the trial: \u201cThis case commenced prior to the introduction of the Victim and Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2014 which provided that victims of human trafficking would be entitled to special measures in court. The case was overseen and prosecuted by the Head of the Sheriff and Jury business for the North of Scotland, who is a specialist in human trafficking cases.\u201d\n\nIn July 2015, Shamsul Arefin was found guilty of human trafficking under the Asylum and Immigration Act and imprisoned for three years. The case marked the first successful prosecution of trafficking for forced labour in Scotland\u2019s history and was heralded by police and politicians across the UK as a positive step towards more successful prosecutions.\n\nBut for his former workers, Arefin\u2019s conviction has offered no resolution or sanctuary. No longer witnesses in a criminal trial, they are fighting to be able to stay and work in the UK until they have tried to claim compensation, or worked to pay off the money for their visas. Ahmed has just had his application for permanent residency turned down by the Home Office; the other three are bracing themselves for similar decisions in the coming weeks. Ahmed has been told he will have to pay \u00a3140 to appeal. All are terrified that their lives, and those of their families, will be at risk if they are forced to return, unable to pay their debts.\n\n\u201cThese cases have been badly handled from the start,\u201d Laird says. \u201cTwo of the men first sought help in September 2010, yet the cases did not reach court for five years. UKBA issued licences to allow Arefin to employ foreign labour in spite of previous offences. The men were further let down by the courts with the lenient sentence given to him, and no compensation was even considered.\u201d\n\nIn March this year, Arefin\u2019s attempt to appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Scottish courts. In the appeal judgment, it emerged that he had been convicted of the sexual assault of two women migrant workers and had been handed a six-month sentence in 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, Azad has remained in Fort William, living in a shared apartment. He has been lucky enough to find work as a chef and waiter in a restaurant, but two-thirds of his wages go towards the interest on his loans. If he is forced to return to Bangladesh, he is convinced it will be the end for him. He says he has had to move his young family three times, because of fears for their safety. His moneylenders there have even threatened to force him to sell one of his kidneys to repay his debts.\n\n\u201cThe UK courts used us to testify, but we have received no compensation for the money we lost or even advice on how to go about trying to claim our unpaid wages,\u201d Azad says. \u201cWe have never wanted or taken benefits from the government. All we want is the chance to work, to provide for our family and recover the debt we paid.\u201d\n\nThat prospect is looking increasingly slim. Azad wonders what he would have made of his life if he\u2019d never answered that advert. \u201cWhen I talk to my family, I cannot tell them about my life here, because it would break them. Everything we had has been destroyed. The trafficker didn\u2019t just take all our money. He took everything from me.\u201d",

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 On the evening of June 15, President Obama joined a conference call with the two men who had done more than anyone in six years to disrupt, derail or defeat his agenda in Congress. Now they were asking for something that was in short supply: trust.\n\nThe president was nervous about their plan, but he desperately needed their help. Most of Mr. Obama\u2019s own party had deserted him on a critical trade vote three days earlier, hours after he had begged them not to. And the Democratic leaders in both chambers were bitterly opposed to his plans to cooperate with Republicans on a far-reaching trade pact with Pacific Rim nations.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, bluntly laid out his plans to save the president\u2019s trade push, and House Speaker John A. Boehner endorsed it on the call. It would be up to Mr. Obama, the two Republicans said, to deliver a handful of Democrats in each chamber for a new set of trade votes \u2014 a high-stakes test for a president who has often seemed indifferent to legislative arm-twisting and whose relationships with lawmakers, even in his own party, have frequently been questioned.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Mr. President, all you have to do is get the same 28 Democrats in the House who voted for it once to do it again,\u2019\u201d Mr. McConnell said in an interview this week. And, he told the president, \u201cget the 14 Senate Democrats\u201d too.\n\nMr. Obama made no firm commitments to the Republicans on the call, according to White House aides, though he warned Mr. McConnell and Mr. Boehner that they would have to come up with some additional measures to \u201csweeten the pot\u201d for his pro-trade Democrats. If the trade vote failed a second time, the broader agreement among 12 Pacific nations could die along with it.\n\nThe plan worked. On Thursday, the House voted on the final piece of trade legislation Mr. Obama needed to clear the way to a legacy-defining pact linking 40 percent of the global economy into a complex web of rules, from lower tariffs to intellectual property protections to expanded Internet access.\n\nIn the end, all it took was Mr. McConnell\u2019s parliamentary acumen and creativity, the president\u2019s nonstop pleading and House Democratic maneuvers that at first blush looked like tactical brilliance but proved too clever by half.\n\nThe campaign to lock in those Democrats began more than a year ago. Mike Froman, the president\u2019s top trade official, members of the cabinet and senior White House staff members targeted about three dozen lawmakers, their names collected in binders and listed in Excel spreadsheets and on dry-erase boards. They called into local radio programs and TV stations, took members to lunches and visited their districts to meet with dairy farmers or environmental groups.\n\nOfficials knew there would be few Democrats open to a trade deal. Since 1979, a Democratic president had not pushed through so-called fast-track authority, which provides international trade deals an up-or-down vote in Congress without amendment or filibuster. With many Democrats suspicious that any trade deal would be a giveaway to big corporations that could lead to substantial job losses among American workers, the administration would be lucky to get more than a handful.\n\nAnd there was additional pressure from unions and environmental groups who bitterly opposed the trade pact and were threatening Democrats who voted for it. At one Democratic caucus meeting, Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, an opponent of trade, lashed out at Mr. Froman.\n\n\u201cThe politest thing to say is he is dissembling or outright lying,\u201d Mr. DeFazio said later, a charge Mr. Froman attributes to misinformation from the opposition groups.\n\nOn the second floor of the West Wing, a \u201cwar room\u201d became a second home to people like Mr. Froman; Jeff Zients, the director of the National Economic Council; Labor Secretary Tom Perez; and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. Slowly, they had assembled 28 pro-trade Democrats in the House and 14 in the Senate, though one of them would drop away. The Senate had passed the trade authority bill, and a worker assistance measure.\n\nBy June 12, White House officials believed they had succeeded.\n\nAs the critical vote approached that day in the House, Mr. Obama made an unscheduled dash to the Capitol to try to persuade fellow Democrats to \u201cplay it straight.\u201d But that morning, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, told the president she would try to block trade authority by holding up the worker assistance bill.\n\nInitially, Mr. Boehner had planned to cancel a vote on the trade authority if the worker assistance measure failed. But as it became apparent what Ms. Pelosi was planning, Mr. Boehner and his chief of staff, Michael Sommers, had a change of heart.\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we lock this down and show that we\u2019ve got the votes?\u201d Mr. Boehner recalled in an interview. \u201cSo we changed our mind. It was a key moment.\u201d\n\nThe trade authority measure narrowly passed, but Ms. Pelosi succeeded in killing the worker assistance bill, knowing that without a victory on both bills, everything stalled for Mr. Obama and the Republicans. At the White House, \u201cit was not elation,\u201d one official recalled. Among Republicans, \u201cthey were crying into their coffee,\u201d as one senior aide put it.\n\nHouse Republicans took to the microphones to declare the fight not over. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, struggled to express optimism, calling the stumble in the House just another example of a \u201clegislative snafu\u201d that \u2014 somehow \u2014 would be corrected.\n\n\u201cFiguring out the legislative procedure and the path forward will principally be the responsibility of members of the legislature,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell tried to do just that. But it wasn\u2019t immediately obvious what the path might be.\n\nSimply trying to force another House vote on the workers\u2019 measure would mean hoping that dozens of lawmakers in both parties would suddenly change their votes, a highly unlikely situation \u2014 even if that was the preferred option of the White House. In the end, the Republican leaders decided to move the fight back to the Senate, where they would hold two separate votes again \u2014 one on trade authority and another on the worker assistance bill.\n\nBecause the House vote on trade authority, called T.P.A., passed, there was an opening. Mr. McConnell just needed to find the right parliamentary magic to get it passed in the Senate and sent to the president.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what opened the door, the fact that the votes were there for T.P.A.,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cThat was helpful, because the whole approach I came up with relied on simply replicating that vote, one more time.\u201d\n\nThe key was trust. Democrats who supported the trade deal were being asked to vote for trade authority without worker retraining assistance attached, on Republican leaders\u2019 word they would help pass the worker assistance measure shortly after.\n\nMr. McConnell first took advantage of a blunder that Ms. Pelosi had made earlier in the process. By demanding a new way to pay for the worker assistance, she had forced House Republican leaders to amend a popular African trade initiative, sending it back to the Senate for another vote \u2014 and giving Mr. McConnell the bill he needed to save the trade push.\n\nMr. McConnell\u2019s parliamentary experts added the worker assistance bill to the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a bill almost certain to earn bipartisan support in both chambers. That provided Democrats who wanted the trade deal with some assurance that Mr. McConnell would make good on his promise to pass the measure.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus, who disliked opening the door to a trade deal but were champions of the African measure, were particularly torn. \u201cI\u2019m angry and disgusted to be put in this situation,\u201d declared Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota. Still, they had little choice but to support the combined bill.\n\nMr. McConnell added a sweetener to make the deal more palatable, a measure that would speed up the government response when foreign competitors \u201cdump\u201d products like steel on the United States markets at artificially low prices. That attracted Rust Belt lawmakers in both parties.\n\nMr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell issued a joint statement declaring they would work to pass the worker assistance bill. At the same time, Mr. Obama worked the phones personally on June 16, calling 10 of the pro-trade senators, some from the White House residence late into the night.\n\n\u201cThey needed many more assurances,\u201d one administration official said.\n\nAmong them was Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, who was among the leaders pushing for the trade authority. When Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, had called him on Father\u2019s Day, Mr. Wyden insisted that his coalition would not abandon the worker assistance measure, known as T.A.A. in Washington jargon.\n\n\u201cOur message was, \u2018We\u2019re not trading T.A.A. for T.P.A.,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cT.A.A. is vital for workers and has been since the Kennedy days of the 1960s.\u201d\n\nBut soon, Democratic support for Mr. McConnell\u2019s approach grew.\n\nOn Wednesday, June 17, before hosting members of Congress at the annual White House summer picnic, Mr. Obama met separately with the pro-trade Democrats in the House and Senate. With the votes looming again, the group seemed solid: 13 in the Senate and 28 in the House. No one had wavered.\n\nThe Senate voted on Wednesday to pass both measures \u2014 the trade authority bill and the worker assistance measure. A final vote on the worker bill in the House on Thursday completed the complex legislative maneuver, sending both bills to the president for his signature.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rule around here,\u201d said Representative Ron Kind, a Democrat from Wisconsin and a leader of the pro-trade Democrats in the House. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got the votes you call the vote, and you don\u2019t take chances by sending people home again.\u201d",

    "text": "The lure of a slimmer, lighter iPad 2 convinced more than 200 people to stand in line at the Apple store in Georgetown before the device went on sale to get their hands on the tablet on the first day.\n\nApple employees kept spirits up by serving hot coffee while gently guiding people away from sneaking glances behind the black curtains covering the store windows. By the time the doors opened at 5 p.m., nearly 300 people were waiting in a line that curled around the block.\n\nAustin Wood, a sophomore at the University of Maryland at College Park who said he had been skeptical about the original iPad, was the first in line. Wood got to the store at midnight Thursday, waiting 17 hours to get his hands on the iPad 2.\n\nThe second generation of Apple's popular tablet is about one-third slimmer than its predecessor, has a dual-core processor designed to make it twice as fast and adds dual cameras. Starting at $499, the iPad 2 was introduced March 2 by Apple chief executive Steve Jobs. Jobs came out of medical leave to introduce the tablet he says will catapult Apple into a \"post-PC era.\"\n\nAnalysts predicted that Apple would sell 600,000 new iPads - available in 16, 32 and 64 GB models - in its first 24 hours, twice the number its predecessor sold in the same period. Apple has sold 15 million of the original iPad to date.\n\nLines around the country were not as long as for the first iPad or the iPhone, according to Twitter messages. Apple put the tablet on sale through its Web site at 4 a.m. Eastern time. Still, demand was high even though the iPad 2 faces stiffer competition than the original. The tablet market is gearing up for a fight between Apple and Google, whose Android-based products such as the Motorola Xoom have surfaced as possible \"iPad killers.\"\n\nEarly reviews say Apple will hold the lead for quite a while.\n\n\"I had to Metro in,\" Wood said. \"The earliest I could have gotten here would have been 8 a.m.\"\n\nHe decided to wait overnight instead. He stayed through the night in the rain, planning which apps he would install first. An Apple fan, Wood had previously waited in line for the iPhone 4.\n\nOthers standing in line said they were there because they had been paid, or were sent ahead by bosses and spouses. Quite a few decided to wait in line simply because they had the afternoon free. Several said they had held out for the second generation of the iPad either to let Apple work out any bugs or to wait for the addition of cameras.\n\nDaniel Ortiz, a freshman from Philadelphia on spring break, was visiting his sister. He said he decided it would be worth it to stand in line for the iPad, which at just more than a pound, can replace his heavy business textbooks and notebooks.\n\nGary Haynes, in town on business from Denver, had recently returned the first-generation iPad he had received as a gift in February, opting for the newer model \"just because it's new.\"\n\nWood stayed in the Apple store for more than a half-hour after buying the iPad, taking advantage of the store's free Internet to install some apps; iBooks and Hulu made the cut. After that?\n\n\"I'll probably take a hot shower,\" he said.",

When he finally learned what had happened from his ex-wife, he launched a legal battle that culminated in 4th District Judge Darold McDade's 48-page ruling Monday that the baby belongs with her father.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s completely elated at the judge\u2019s ruling,\u201d attorney Mark Wiser told FoxNews.com. \u201cHe felt the judge could not rule any other way.\u201d\n\nAchane now hopes the girl\u2019s adoptive parents, Jared and Kristi Frei, will visit him in South Carolina to make the girl\u2019s transition as easy as possible. McDade has given the couple 60 days to return the child, Wiser said.\n\nMcDade, who faulted the Adoption Center of Choice, which brokered the adoption, for refusing to tell Achane where the baby was living, has scheduled a Jan. 16 hearing in Provo, Utah.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that the child will be returned to the father at that time and he\u2019ll take her back to South Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is willing and has made offers to the adoptive family to go to South Carolina.

Achane and the girl\u2019s mother, Tira Bland, soon began having marital problems shortly thereafter and she grew concerned that she would become a single mother with two children.\n\nBland then suggested the couple either pursue an adoption or an abortion, both of which Achane rejected. After considering a move to South Carolina, Bland later told Achane she wished to stay in Texas with her relatives for the birth of their daughter. Achane had planned to return for the birth, with the new family joining him in South Carolina afterward.\n\nBland would later proceed with an adoption, according to the judge\u2019s ruling, contacting the Adoption Center of Choice, which brought Bland to Utah to give birth.\n\nWiser said he equally blames Bland and the adoptive agency for Achane\u2019s anguish.\n\n\u201cShe was not telling the truth,\u201d Wiser said of Bland. \u201cNow, with that, the adoption agency equally ran with this and knew this was a married family.\u201d\n\nJames Webb, executive director of the Adoption Center of Choice, declined comment when reached by FoxNews.com.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of facts that need to be brought out and litigating them in the court of public opinion is a bit challenging,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\n\nThe Freis, meanwhile, who maintain a blog detailing the custody battle, did not return a message seeking comment.

GDP growth in the second quarter slipped to 7.6%, the slowest clip in three years. Manufacturing output and exports have been weak and the property sector has stalled. The IMF recently lowered its forecast for China\u2019s growth in 2012 to 8% \u2014 which would be the economy\u2019s worst performance since 1999. And with the sagging data have come louder and louder cries for greater government stimulus to pump up growth, as Beijing\u2019s policymakers did successfully after the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cThere\u2019s lots more the government can do to ratchet things up,\u201d HSBC said in a recent report.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what China doesn\u2019t need, however. Government policies to greatly boost growth will only exacerbate the percolating dangers within the Chinese economy \u2014 dangers that could even result in an economic crisis. Instead, the current slowdown shows how badly China needs a new growth model, and the reform necessary to build one.\n\n(MORE: Why China Should Slow Down)\n\nFor several years now, economists have been warning that China\u2019s growth is unbalanced and, therefore, unsustainable. The economy is too dependent on investment and exports to drive growth, they argue, and to fix that problem, Beijing has to do more to encourage domestic consumption as another pillar of development. Not much has really been done to \u201crebalance\u201d the economy, however, and sometimes it seemed that didn\u2019t much matter. As the economists babbled, the economy continued to grow.\n\nAs the global recovery stumbles and Europe remains embroiled in a debt crisis, Chinese exports have taken a hit. At home, meanwhile, Beijing\u2019s efforts to control rapidly rising property prices dampened investment in real estate. Property-investment growth in the first half of 2012 was half the rate posted in the same period of 2011. China, though, has nothing else to keep growth going. Its own consumers can\u2019t fill in the gap. Private consumption in China relative to GDP is among the lowest of any major economy and remains constrained by government policies that punish consumers to subsidize investment. Thus the need to rebalance. If China\u2019s consumers played a bigger role in overall national growth, the country would have another leg to stand on when the others weaken.\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t China done more to rebalance? The scale of the adjustment necessary to switch from an investment-led to consumption-led growth machine is so monstrous that the country would likely experience a lower rate of growth while it is taking place \u2014 something policymakers so far have been reluctant to accept. Rebalancing will also require major reforms within the economy \u2014 such as liberalizing regulated interest rates and curtailing the influence of the state sector \u2014 which would pinch powerful interest groups. Policymakers have thus chosen to talk about rebalancing while perpetuating the policies that prevent it from happening.\n\n(PHOTOS: A Record of China\u2019s Changing Coastlines)\n\nBeijing has trotted out many of the same stimulus policies used after the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse to stimulate growth. China\u2019s central bank cut its benchmark interest rate twice in less than a month recently, and the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve has been reduced to encourage lending. The government is also fast-tracking approvals of new infrastructure projects. Some economists expect more such action to be taken in the second half of the year.\n\nIn doing so, however, Beijing will only exacerbate the frightening distortions within the economy. Easier money will fuel even high levels of debt, which have already spiked in recent years. That will come to haunt the financial sector in the form of increased numbers of bad loans. Much of any new lending would end up in the hands of state companies, which are terribly inefficient and wasteful. In other words, large-scale stimulus measures will perpetuate the economy\u2019s reliance on investment, leaving it continually vulnerable rather than building new sources of growth. Rating agency Fitch warned earlier this month of the dangers of pursuing this strategy:\n\nRenewed reliance on investment to support activity threatens to prolong the Chinese economy\u2019s structural imbalances \u2026 Statements by senior officials including Premier Wen Jiabao have pointed to renewed emphasis on investment to support growth in the remainder of the year. An investment-led strategy backed by monetary easing is likely to avoid a \u201chard landing\u201d in the short term \u2026 However, this investment-led strategy is likely to be at the cost of postponing resolution of the economy\u2019s structural imbalance towards investment. Moreover, the rise in investment as a share of GDP since 2008, which is inherently unsustainable, has coincided with deteriorating efficiency as measured by the ratio of incremental output per unit of investment.\n\n(MORE: Are China\u2019s Big State Companies a Big Problem for the Global Economy?)\n\nYet at the same time, there are indications that China\u2019s policymakers understand the risks inherent in massive stimulus. The current efforts to propel growth are far smaller in scale than what the government employed in 2008\u201309. Key restrictions on the property sector, like measures to limit speculative purchases of apartments, have remained firmly in place even as the sector has faltered. And as Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University, pointed out in the Financial Times the other day, China has allowed real interest rates to rise substantially \u2014 a measure that would curtail investment while boosting the income of savers and thus consumption. Such a policy direction would inevitably lead to slower but ultimately healthier growth \u2014 a course, Pettis convincingly argues, the rest of the world should encourage:\n\nAs China rebalances we would expect slowing growth and rapidly rising real interest rates, which is exactly what we are seeing. Rather than panicking and demanding that Beijing reverse the process, we should be relieved that China is finally solving its problems.\n\nThe intentions of China\u2019s policy mandarins will become clear over the next few months. Taking the proper reform measures will require the government to accept a lower growth rate while the economy adjusts. Will they take more drastic steps to pump up the country\u2019s existing but strained growth model or earnestly start the process of creating a new growth model? The future of China\u2019s economic miracle may well depend on the answer.\n\nPHOTOS: China Celebrates 90 Years of Communism",

    "text": "Andy Rubin, the engineer leading Google\u2019s efforts to develop robots, seen at his home in Los Altos Hills, Calif., in 2007.\n\nRobots work tirelessly in factories, often around the clock, to churn out cars, computers and pack bags of cookies into boxes. They never complain, ask for breaks or demand bigger paychecks. In fact, robotic technology is advancing so quickly that machines are taking on a growing list of responsibilities once handled exclusively by humans. Over the past few years, they\u2019ve started to help doctors with surgery, fetch products in warehouses and milk dairy cows.\n\nGoogle is hoping to create robots that can take on even more responsibilities. Last week, the company disclosed that it acquired seven start-ups focused on robotics and that it was busy cobbling those pieces into a business, according to the New York Times.\n\nWhy would Google, which first gained fame with its search engine, push in robotics? Co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are big fans of futuristic projects, referred to inside the company as \u201cmoon shots.\u201d After all, they have already taken on the challenge of building self-driving cars, a technology that is closely tied to robotics. But there is also another very big reason to invest in a new robot initiative: A big potential payday.\n\nGlobal sales of robots are expected to grow 10.5 percent annually to $20.2 billion in 2016, according to the Freedonia Group, a market research firm. It\u2019s a huge market with plenty of willing business customers, as long as they\u2019re convinced that the cost of buying robots is cheaper and more efficient than leaving the work to humans.\n\nIndustrial robots have long been the source of most sales in the robotics industry. Their mechanical arms weld cars, assemble circuit boards and put labels on packages of food. Typically, such robots are bolted down and operated from within a protective cage to keep workers nearby from getting injured.\n\nHowever, much of the expected growth in sales is expected to come from outside of factories with what\u2019s known as service robots. They are mobile so that they can be quickly moved to where they\u2019re needed and safe enough to work side-by-side with their human colleagues. Service robots have long been a dream in the robotics field. But improvements in technology have only recently made them feasible.\n\n\u201cThe idea of putting robots and people together collaboratively is starting to become a big trend,\u201d said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation, the umbrella organization for three trade groups focused on different areas of robotics.\n\nService robots are already at doing the grunt work inside biomedical research labs. They\u2019re also helping doctors make more precise incisions during surgery and defusing bombs for the military and law enforcement. Baxter, a robot from Rethink Robotics with a distinctly human-looking design, can pack cans of food off conveyer belts and inspect metal parts on the assembly line for defects. Meanwhile, Roomba, from iRobot, is an automated vacuum cleaner that resembles a metallic Frisbee.\n\nFrank Tobe, publisher of The Robot Report, a news site focused on the robotics industry said a big opportunity for Google or any company lies with small and medium-sized businesses. It\u2019s an area that is largely untapped because of the high cost of today\u2019s robots and the complexities of programming them. \u201cThat\u2019s the huge market and the kind of conceptual talent that Google brings to the table,\u201d Tobe said. \u201cWhat you need is for the robot to be easy enough to teach so that an enthusiastic worker can training it intuitively.\u201d\n\nCheap robots could help the overall economy, as well, he said. No longer would companies have to send their jobs overseas because of cheaper wages. \u201cOne way to bring things back to the manufacturing facilities here is to be able to figure out how to do it with automation cheaply,\u201d Tobe said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s effort to develop robots is led by Andy Rubin, the engineer who created the Android software for smartphones. Early in his career, he worked in robotics and remained keenly interested in the field.\n\nIn an online post last week, Page, Google\u2019s chief executive, said of Rubin: \u201cI am excited about Andy Rubin\u2019s next project. His last big bet, Android, started off as a crazy idea that ended up putting a supercomputer in hundreds of millions of pockets. It is still very early days for this, but I can\u2019t wait to see the progress.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s precise plan for its robot project remains vague, according to the New York Times. Manufacturing and logistics are among the areas of interest. Google could potentially put some of the technology to use in assembling its line of smartphones, tablets and laptop computers. It could also use robots \u2013 as Amazon does \u2013 in its warehouses to fill orders.\n\nBased on the start-ups it acquired, Burnstein, the association president, suspects that Google plans to use robots for loading trucks and handling packages. Google is experimenting with a same-day shopping delivery service around San Francisco and it could use robots to automate parts of the process if it expands into more cities.\n\nOf course, entering the robotics field from scratch has its challenges. A number of big established companies have dipped in their toes over the years only to later pull out or fail to gain much traction. IBM, GE and Microsoft are just a few of the examples. The robotics business simply didn\u2019t develop as quickly as they thought it would.\n\n\u201cA small market for a big company like GM or GE isn\u2019t worth chasing,\u201d Burnstein said.",

Find out where all your favorite villains came from in this dark, tense prequel that doesn\u2019t suffer at all for not featuring any super powers.\n\nPremiere: Wednesday, 24 September, at 9.30pm ET\n\nAnthony Anderson stars as an advertising executive whose son would rather play field hockey and be called Andy than play basketball and use his given name, Andr\u00e9. What exactly does \u201ckeeping it real\u201d look like in the supposed \u201cpost-racial\u201d Obama age? Blackish doesn\u2019t have all the answers, but it is daring enough to ask the question.\n\nPremiere: Thursday, 25 September, at 10pm ET\n\nHow to Get Away with Murder is pure trash and it is amazing. As we come to expect from executive producer Shonda Rhimes, this show about Annalise Keating, a bristly defense attorney and law school professor (the divine Viola Davis), moves faster than The Flash with diarrhea. There are about 10 WTF moments in the pilot alone. But as Keating and her students solve cases and dispose of a body of their own (it\u2019s not a spoiler, it happens in the show\u2019s first two minutes) this is bound to be a twisty, turny whodunit that never lets up on the accelerator. Would we want our pulp trash any other way?\n\nPremiere: All episodes start streaming Friday, 26 September, and the pilot is available now\n\nThere is a great shock at the end of the first episode of Transparent, the second of Amazon\u2019s jillion pilots that has been ordered to series. Creator Jill Soloway shows us a father (Arrested Development\u2019s Jeffrey Tambor) and his three adult children who are all trying to reinvent their stilted lives, and become independent people. This is a show about \u2018first world problems\u2019 with enough feeling that you\u2019ll want to keep watching.\n\nPremiere: Thursday, October 2, at 9.30pm ET or stream it now.\n\nThis season there are a ton of romantic comedy pilots, but this is the only one worth spending your time on. Ostensibly an exhaustive account of the relationship between romantic Andrew (Ben Feldman) and pragmatist Zelda (Cristin Milioti), the show is not only a look at many-splendored love, but a smart and quirky comedy that will wrap you up like a bring pink princess fleece covered in fairy dust. That\u2019s a good thing.\n\nPremiere: Thursday, 2 October, at 9pm ET\n\nFor those of you who watched Broadchurch on BBC America last summer you know about the many qualities of this show, about a small seaside town ravaged by the murder of a young boy. Luckily it seems like Fox hasn\u2019t done much to mess with the formula of the show (even though they claim to have given it a different ending). David Tennant reprises his role as a detective with a dark past and Anna Gunn (from Breaking Bad) takes over as Ellie, his partner who can\u2019t help but get personally involved in the investigation.\n\nPremiere: Sunday, 12 October, at 10pm ET\n\nThe trick of telling a story from a male point of a view and a female point of view has been tried before (in fact, a similar device is used on ABC\u2019s awful Manhattan Love Story), but never has it been done with the amount of insight and intrigue as on this new drama. Both Noah (Dominic West), a conflicted but contented family man, and Allison (Ruth Wilson), the waitress he falls in love with, get to tell the police their side of the story of their relationship. Why are the police there? We\u2019ll have to find out, but this seems like an emotional version of True Detective that will continue to keep us guessing.\n\nPermiere: Tuesday, 14 October, at 9pm ET\n\nWhy should you watch Marry Me? Because you jerks let Happy Endings get cancelled.\n\nLike Happy Endings, it stars Casey Wilson (Kaspe\u2019s wife) and veteran funny man Ken Marino as a couple with a very unconventional relationship. You\u2019ll laugh, you\u2019ll cry, your heart will melt.\n\nPremiere: Thursday, 30 October, 2014, at 9.30pm ET\n\nI have a feeling I might live to regret this advice but, everyone should watch The McCarthys. I know, I know, there is nothing more square than a CBS sitcom \u2013 but this one, about a father (Jack McGee) and his newly-out gay son (Tyler Ritter) who coach a high school basketball together, made me actually LOL more than any other new fall comedy.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because as a gay son of a sports-crazed Irish-Catholic New England family myself I really related to the situation? Maybe it\u2019s because comedic genius Laurie Metcalf plays the passive-aggressive mother? Maybe it\u2019s because Joey McIntyre (yes, that Joey McIntyre) finally has a full-time job in the cast? I don\u2019t know.\n\nYes, the jokes at the expense of the gay characters are pretty awful, but the rest of the writing is shockingly solid.",

    "text": "Image by Getty Images via @daylife\n\nA new release of incriminating e-mail exchanges between leading climate scientists that is now being termed \u201cClimategate II\u201d actually represents but another episode in a continuing scandal that has been taking place for decades. This fraud of massive scope and consequence has served as the basis for arguably the greatest regulatory overreach of all time.\n\nIt has been used to justify the EPA\u2019s demands that restrict carbon dioxide and other \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d emissions from stationary sources they attribute to causing climate change. Included are electrical power generation facilities, iron and steel mills, pulp and paper mills, cement production, and the construction industry.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s \u201cEndangerment Finding\u201d applied to support these actions was based upon politically-manipulated human-caused climate warming conclusions issued by the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that were even at odds with findings of its own internal study on the matter. That EPA report stated \u201cgiven the downward trend in temperatures since 1998 (which some think will continue until at least 2030), there is no particular reason to rush into decisions based upon a scientific hypothesis that does not appear to explain most of the available data.\u201d\n\nAs if the first round of e-mails purloined from the U.K.\u2019s East Anglia University Climate Research Unit (CRU) network weren\u2019t damning enough, the new batch of about 5,000 more obtained through an anonymous source identified as \u201cFOIA\u201d are truly stunning. Many clearly confirm that top IPCC scientists consciously misrepresented and actively withheld important information\u2026then attempted to prevent discovery. Included are CRU\u2019s Director of Research, Phil Jones, the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) climate\u2019s analysis section head, Kevin Trenberth; and beleaguered Penn State University \u201chockey stick\u201d originator, Michael Mann.\n\n\u201cIf there were any doubts remaining after reading the first Climategate e-mails, the new batch of e-mails that appeared on the web today [November 22] make it clear that the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is an organized conspiracy dedicated to tricking the world into believing that global warming is a crisis that requires a drastic response,\u201d said Myron Ebell, Director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2019s Center on Energy and Environment. \u201cSeveral of the new e-mails show that the scientists involved in doctoring the IPCC reports are very aware that the energy-rationing policies that their junk science is meant to support would cost trillions of dollars.\u201d\n\nPhil Jones, who served as a lead author for one of the key chapters in IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report (2007), leaves no doubt of intentions to keep embarrassing and conspiratorial disclosures under tight wraps:\n\nI\u2019ve been told that IPCC is above national FOI Acts. One way to cover yourself and all those working on AR5 would be to delete all e-mails at the end of the process. Any work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get \u2013 and has to be well hidden. I\u2019ve discussed this with the main funder (U.S. Department of Energy) in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data.\n\nIn another e-mail Jones admits that the climate models alarmist claims have been built upon can\u2019t be trusted: \u201cBasic problem is that all models are wrong \u2013 not got enough middle and low level clouds. \u2026what he [Zwiers] has done comes to a different conclusion than Caspar and Gene! I reckon this can be saved by careful wording.\u201d\n\nJones certainly isn\u2019t alone in recognizing serious credibility problems posed by continued use of model-based climate forecasts. Regarding the \u201cfuture of IPCC\u201d, one scientist observes, \u201cIt is inconceivable that policymakers will be willing to make billion-and trillion-dollar decisions for adaptation to the projected regional climate change based on models that do not even describe and simulate the processes that are the building blocks of climate variability.\u201d Another admits: \u201c\u2026clearly, some tuning or very good luck [is] involved. I doubt the modeling world will be able to get away with this much longer.\u201d Tom Wigley of the NCAR complained in still another exchange: \u201cMike, the Figure you sent is very deceptive \u2026 there have been a number of dishonest presentations of model results by individual authors and by IPCC \u2026\u201d\n\nAfter NCAR\u2019s Kevin Trenberth found he couldn\u2019t defend his correlation between global warming and extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes based upon Northern Hemisphere records, he instead advocated shifting IPCC report references to Japan events: \u201c\u2026 opposing some things said by people like Chris Landsea who has said all the stuff going on is natural variability. In addition to the 4 hurricanes hitting Florida, there has been a record number hit Japan 10?? and I saw a report saying Japanese scientists had linked this to global warming \u2026 I am leaning toward the idea of getting a box on changes in hurricanes, perhaps written by a Japanese.\u201d Phil Jones agreed, writing, \u201cWe can put a note in that something will be there in the next draft, or Kevin or I will write something \u2013 it depends on whether and what we get from Japan.\u201d\n\nJones was anxious to get the warming-hurricane connection into the scientific literature. He wrote in another e-mail to Trenberth: \u201cKevin, Seems that this potential Nature [journal] paper may be worth citing, if it does say that GW [global warming] is having an effect on TC [tropical cyclone] activity.\u201d And in another communication Jones wanted to make sure that people who supported this connection be represented in IPCC reviews. \u201cGetting people we know and trust [into IPCC] is vital \u2013 hence my comment about the tornadoes group.\u201d\n\nSeveral exchanges reveal that certain researchers believed well-intentioned ideology trumped objective science. Jonathan Overpeck, a coordinating lead IPCC report author, stated: \u201cThe trick may be to decide on the main message and use that to guid[e] what\u2019s",

    "text": "By Tom Curry, National Affairs Writer, NBC News\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly \u201cmission accomplished\u201d but just over two months ago, President Barack Obama told Americans that while the effort to \u201cdismantle terrorist organizations must continue, this war, like all wars, must end.\u201d\n\nYet the events of this week could complicate Obama\u2019s efforts to decouple his anti-terrorism policies from the language of the \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d\n\nWith the brisk withdrawal of U.S. government personnel from Yemen at dawn Tuesday, the State Department\u2019s warning of an \u201cextremely high\u201d risk of a terrorist attack in that country, and another U.S. drone strike in Yemen overnight, the landscape looks different today than it did on May 23 when Obama delivered his major terrorism address at the National Defense University.\n\nWatch President Barack Obama's full speech to the National Defense University on May 23, 2013.\n\nIn that speech, Obama set out to persuade Americans that they ought to think differently and use updated labels to describe the effort against al Qaeda: \u201cWe must define our effort not as a boundless \u2018global war on terror,\u2019 but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America.\u201d\n\nReporters pressed White House spokesman Jay Carney on Monday about whether Obama had been premature in signaling a ratcheting down of the war on terror back in May, with one reporter asking, \u201cWith nearly two dozen embassies and consulates being closed, is it fair anymore to say that core al Qaeda is on the path to defeat?\u201d\n\nAnother reporter questioned whether the 2012 Obama campaign\u2019s \u201cbin Laden is dead\u201d mantra gave false re-assurance to voters.\n\nUsing phrasing similar to that in Obama\u2019s May 23 speech, Carney explained that \u201cas al Qaeda core has been diminished through the efforts of the United States and our allies, affiliate organizations -- including in particular, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- have strengthened.\u201d\n\nHe also told reporters, \u201cThe president has been clear that the threat from al Qaeda very much remains \u2026 .Nobody should be under any illusion that that threat still exists.\u201d\n\nAnd State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki on Tuesday told reporters that it is \u201cinaccurate\u201d to call the withdrawal of personnel from Yemen an \u201cevacuation.\u201d\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki talks about the closing of American diplomatic posts during Tuesday's press briefing.\n\n\u201cThis is a reduction in staffing,\u201d Psaki said, adding, \u201cwe still have a presence in Yemen, the U.S. government does, the State Department does, we will still be able to provide some services, obviously some limited staff may limit that. And we\u2019ll continue to evaluate.\u201d\n\nIn his May address Obama said, \u201cNot every collection of thugs that labels themselves al Qaeda will pose a credible threat to the United States.\u201d\n\nAnd he very deliberately set the clock back to the era before Sept. 11, 2001: The current threat, he said, is \u201clethal yet less capable al Qaeda affiliates; threats to diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad; homegrown extremists.\u201d And he added, \u201cthe scale of this threat closely resembles the types of attacks we faced before 9/11.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s National Defense University speech wasn\u2019t a declaration of victory. He did not promise a world in which there\u2019d be no terror attacks on Americans. In fact, he included several cautions: \u201cmake no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth.\u201d\n\nAnd, he noted the obvious: \u201cNeither I, nor any president, can promise the total defeat of terror.\u201d\n\nYet despite those disclaimers, Obama argued that not only is \u201cwar\u201d no longer the right term to describe efforts against al Qaeda, but that since the threat is diminishing and since U.S. \u201csuper-max\u201d prisons are secure, it\u2019s finally time to close Guantanamo and put some of the detainees in federal prisons.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government still doesn\u2019t have any criteria for determining what terrorist groups are part of the al Qaeda movement and what ones aren\u2019t, for determining which ones are globally focused in terms of wanting to run operations against the United States and which ones are primarily local,\u201d said Christopher Swift, an adjunct professor of National Security Studies at Georgetown University. \u201cAnd because we still haven\u2019t identified who is and who isn\u2019t the enemy, it\u2019s really hard for the U.S. government to tell the American people exactly what the problem is.\u201d\n\nReaction from leading Republicans to that May 23 address was stinging. Sen. John McCain, R- Ariz., said that \u201cto somehow argue that al Qaeda is \u2018on the run\u2019 comes from a degree of unreality that to me is really incredible.\u201d He argued that al Qaeda is \u201cexpanding all over the Middle East\u201d and in North Africa.\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney piled on, calling Obama \u201cjust dead wrong on the status of the threat\u201d from al Qaeda and disputing Obama\u2019s judgment that the struggle against al Qaeda is winding down. \u201cThe threat is bigger than ever,\u201d Cheney contended.\n\nNo matter how earnest Obama\u2019s hopes were in that May 23 speech for closing Guantanamo and redefining counter-terrorism, the past few days\u2019 events don\u2019t seem to move him and Congress closer to his goal.\n\nThis story was originally published on Tue Aug 6, 2013 4:52 PM EDT",

    "text": "\u201cThis report will generate some attention and discussion, but we don\u2019t know how valid the analysis is,\u201d said Sharon P. Robinson, president of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. \u201cThey ask for a lot of documents, reviewed by people we do not know, against rubrics we are not privileged to see.\u201d\n\nIn some areas, like the length of student-teaching placement, Dr. Robinson said, the council\u2019s standards are less rigorous than what many education schools require. In others, she said, the standards actually go against the current direction of education overhaul.\n\n\u201cA school can lose points for not having absolute control over the selection of the cooperation teacher,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we think these clinical experiences should be crafted in partnership with the schools, not dictated by either the principal or the education school.\u201d\n\nThis year, officials from 35 leading education colleges and graduate schools wrote to the editor of U.S. News, criticizing the council\u2019s methodology, and complaining about the \u201cimplied coercion\u201d in the initial plan to use open-records laws to get information the schools would not supply voluntarily \u2014 or, if the information was unavailable, give the schools an F.\n\nAmong the 134 schools in the report, 12 asked not to be included; the council included them anyway, using public records requests to get information about the public institutions, and indicating with an asterisk institutions for which some information was unavailable.\n\nThe ranking plan is more popular among state education officials. In 10 states, the chief education officer has specifically endorsed the council\u2019s project.\n\n\u201cThis is shaping up to be quite a battle royale, not just between the education schools and us, but between K-12 education and higher ed, since state school officers want this information, but education schools are fighting it,\u201d Ms. Walsh said.\n\nThe pushback might delay the rankings, which were to be published late next year, she said.\n\n\u201cOur schedule was predicated on schools voluntarily complying, as they do with all other U.S. News and World projects,\u201d Ms. Walsh said.\n\nBecause some of the standards on which the education schools were ranked are subjective, some institutions ranked \u201cpoor\u201d said they disagreed with that rating. Ten programs, or 7 percent, were rated as having \u201cmodel\u201d design; 17 percent had \u201cgood\u201d design, and the rest were rated \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cpoor.\u201d\n\nFayneese Miller, dean of the College of Education and Social Services at the University of Vermont, the largest teacher-training school in the state, said she could not understand why her school got a \u201cpoor\u201d \u2014 worse than the other two Vermont schools ranked \u2014 when hers is the only education school in the state that exceeds all state standards, the only one with national accreditation and the one with the longest student-teaching placements.\n\n\u201cWe have no problem about being evaluated, but as you can imagine, I am not at all pleased about the way they conducted the study,\u201d Dr. Miller said. \u201cThis has major implications for us in terms of our ability to attract and place our students.\u201d\n\nThe council, however, said that, like many education schools, the University of Vermont\u2019s did not meet its standards because it left principals too big a role in choosing cooperating teachers, and did not do enough to ensure that they are effective teachers who will be good mentors.\n\nAt New York University, rated \u201cweak\u201d \u2014 along with CUNY Lehman and SUNY Cortland, the other two New York institutions included in the report \u2014 Mary M. Brabeck, dean of the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, also took issue with council\u2019s methodology, saying that she would grade the report \u201cpoor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt relies on standards that appear arbitrary and unsupported by research, and it uses them to draw incorrect conclusions,\u201d Dr. Brabeck said in an e-mail.\n\nFor example, she said, N.Y.U.\u2019s elementary education students must have four different placements, and 15 weeks of student teaching, more than required to meet the council\u2019s standards. But because of the way the placements are structured, they are counted as not meeting the standards.",

The Group of 20, which includes the eight and an array of nations from Argentina to Indonesia to Turkey, has emerged in recent months as a potent forum addressing the global recession.\n\nPresident George W.

Developing countries like China and India agreed to make \u201cmeaningful\u201d reductions in greenhouse gases but refused to accept the specific targets for 2050 sought by the United States and Europe.\n\nMr. Obama cast that as victory enough, until discussions resume at the Group of 20. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a good start,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I am the first one to acknowledge that progress on this issue will not be easy.\u201d\n\nThe developing countries of the Group of 20 say the days of the smaller club are numbered. \u201cThe G-8 is over as a political decision group,\u201d Celso Amorim, Brazil\u2019s foreign minister, said last month at a conference in Paris. It \u201crepresents nothing at all,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cyou simply can\u2019t ignore emerging countries such as Brazil, China or India.\u201d\n\nStill, talk of restructuring or scrapping the Group of 8 invariably runs into resistance from current members. At a news conference on opening night, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, the host, said the summit meeting was \u201cideal for building confidence and cordiality, for creating friendships and deepening friendships.\u201d He added, \u201cWe call each other by our first names and not our last names\u201d and gather \u201cat the same informal table.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt Italy pulled off a tour de force of last-minute organization, spending $75 million to transform a police training complex in an earthquake zone into an Olympic-style village, complete with high-quality espresso bars and wicker lawn sets. Cooks are preparing 25,000 meals over three days, and 3,700 journalists registered to attend.\n\nIt is a far cry from the original meeting outside Paris in 1975, when leaders of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan inaugurated the Group of 6. Canada joined two years later, and it became the Group of 7, an organization without organization \u2014 no headquarters, no bylaws, no staff, just a rotating leadership to hold the annual meeting.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton got Russia admitted in 1997, and others started attending as observers. By this year, there was a regular meeting with China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, now dubbed the Group of 5.\n\nMr. Berlusconi also invited Egypt, so the secondary meeting became known as the G-8 + 5 + 1. Then there was a working lunch with international organizations called the G-8 + 5 + 1 + 5. Given that China\u2019s president, Hu Jintao, abruptly left to deal with rioting at home, perhaps it should have been called the G-8 + 5 + 1 + 5 \u2014 1.\n\nThen there is breakfast on Friday with African leaders. All told, roughly 40 countries representing 90 percent of the world economy sent leaders to L\u2019Aquila. But that has risks of its own; a president never knows whom he might run into. Mr. Obama found himself shaking hands on Thursday with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya.\n\nRobert C. Fauver, who was Mr. Clinton\u2019s sherpa, agreed that the Group of 8 could be redefined, but noted that has complications too. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to negotiate an exchange rate deal with 20 countries or a bailout of Mexico, as in the early Clinton days, with 20 countries that\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you get above 10, it just makes it too darn hard to get things done.\u201d\n\nAttending his 21st summit meeting, John Kirton, director of the Group of 8 Research Group at the University of Toronto, said the group would evolve with additional formats involving more countries. But he said the core eight still represented unrivaled political and economic power and had the duty to weigh in on issues of democracy that others could not.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that the eight can do that the others can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll always need the G-8.\u201d",

Cash, special agent in charge of the Miami Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration. ''He perfected smuggling methods and intricate laundering operations involving many countries around the globe, and this is why it took efforts in so many countries to complete this case.''\n\nAccording to the indictment, Mr. Marks has since 1970 headed a criminal enterprise specializing in marijuana and hashish trafficking from the Orient, initially to Western Europe and from 1973 also to the United States and Canada. According to the indictment, the enterprise spanned the world: it operated in Britain, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, West Germany, the Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Canada and the United States. Mr. Cash said that ''thousands of tons'' of marijuana and hashish had been smuggled into the United States and Canada in the last 15 years by the Marks enterprise. He said more than $9 million in cash had been seized from the group, in addition to other properties, including a 103-feet-long vessel in Vancouver, British Columbia. Jumped Bail in Nevada\n\nMr. Marks is a fugitive from United States justice. In 1976, he was arrested on drug charges in Nevada, jumped bail and left the country before trial. In 1980, he faced narcotics charges in London. He was found not guilty, and part of his defense was his statement that he had been an agent of MI6, the British equivalent of the United States' Central Intelligence Agency. Dexter W. Lehtinen, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, said law-enforcement agencies of 13 countries had collaborated in an ''extremely complex international investigation of a large multinational narcotics enterprise.''\n\nMr. Marks, a 43-year-old graduate of Oxford University, was arrested this morning in Madrid, as was his wife, Judith Margaret, also a British subject, who was also indicted, said Mr. Cash. According to the indictment, undercover agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration played an important role in the investigation.\n\nOther people arrested today were Geoffrey H. Kenion, a British subject, who was apprehended in Spain; Chi Chuen Lo of Thailand, arrested in London, and Patrick Alexander Lane, Mr. Marks's brother-in-law, who was taken into custody in Miami.\n\nMr. Cash said the others suspects are British subjects or citizens of Pakistan, the United States and Thailand and are sought in their respective countries. Subject of a Book\n\nMr. Cash said the United States asked Spain today for the extradition of Mr. Marks and his wife to face trial in Miami. Mr. Cash said proceedings could take from 60 to 90 days.\n\nMr. Marks, born in Wales, was the subject of a book published in 1984 in London under the title ''High Time.'' Its author, David Leigh, calls Mr. Marks ''one of the biggest ever international drug smugglers.'' The book is described as a story of a boy from Wales who rose to the top of the dope trade through his Oxford studies in the 1960's.\n\nThe book depicts Mr. Marks as a man who made and lost millions, dressed in a expensive suits, led a life of a playboy in London and New York, was arrested in the Scottish Highlands and acquitted in a long Old Bailey trial, ''severly embarrassing MI6.''\n\nMr. Cash said Mr. Marks became involved in drug culture while studying for his doctorate in physics.\n\nIf convicted, Mr. Marks could face up to 20 years in prison.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the first week of March, a laid-off person living on $300 a week in unemployment benefits is liable to find a surprise in the mailbox: notification from Uncle Sam that come April the check will be $33 lighter.\n\nRecess at a school in Gallup, N.M., where the local school district would be affected more than most others by federal budget cuts.\n\n\u201cSequestration,\u201d that arcane budget term consuming Washington in recent weeks, is about to move from political abstraction to objective reality for tens of millions of Americans. Barring an extremely unlikely last-minute deal, about $85 billion is set to be cut from military, domestic and certain health care programs beginning Friday.\n\nMuch of the government will be immune, only magnifying the cuts for the rest. If they are not reversed, federal spending at the discretion of Congress will eventually fall to a new five-decade low. Cuts of even larger size are scheduled to take effect every year over the next 10, signaling an era of government austerity.\n\nBy the end of this week, federal agencies will notify governors, private contractors, grant recipients and other stakeholders of the dollars they would be about to lose. As of March 1, the Treasury Department will immediately trim subsidies for clean energy projects, school construction, state and local infrastructure projects and some small-business health insurance subsidies.\n\nNearly two million people who have been out of work for more than six months could see unemployment payments drop by 11 percent in checks that arrive in late March or the first days of April, according to the White House budget office, an average of $132 a month. Doctors who treat Medicare patients will see cuts to their reimbursements.\n\nIf the stalemate in Washington continues, furloughs and layoffs will probably begin in April, starting largely in the 800,000-member civilian work force of the Defense Department and then rippling across the country, from meat inspectors in Iowa to teachers in rural New Mexico.\n\n\u201cIf they hit me with a $3 million cut in March, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d said Raymond R. Arsenault, the superintendent of the Gallup-McKinley County Schools, a district that serves primarily Navajo students on the Arizona-New Mexico border.\n\nMr. Arsenault\u2019s school system would be hit much harder than most because 35 percent of his $100 million annual budget comes from federal education \u201cimpact aid\u201d to offset the large tracts of land that are owned by Washington and therefore not subject to taxation. Of that, $3 million may be about to disappear.\n\nThe sequester involves trimming $85 billion from a $3.6 trillion annual federal budget, or about 2.4 percent. But the cuts will not affect Social Security or Medicaid, and the Medicare cuts total only about $11 billion in the 2013 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, according to calculations by the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nThus, entitlement spending, which poses the biggest long-term challenge to the federal budget, accounts for only a sliver of the cuts. That leaves more than $70 billion in cuts to be applied over the next seven months to the roughly two-fifths of the budget that is devoted to discretionary spending, including the military, education and dozens of other categories.\n\nIn a matter of weeks the cuts would cascade through the government, delaying snow removal on the Tioga Pass in Yosemite National Park, for example, and keeping an aircraft carrier battle group docked in Norfolk, Va., rather than steaming through the Persian Gulf.\n\n\u201cThe cut is so big and over such a short period of time that there\u2019s no way to avoid all the operational and program harms,\u201d said Daniel I. Werfel, controller of the White House budget office.\n\nThese cuts would probably not be confined to 2013. Even if President Obama manages to persuade Congress to raise new revenue, he has said he would replace only half of the spending cuts with tax increases, in essence accepting a half-trillion dollars in cuts over 10 years. That would be on top of more than $1 trillion in cuts already enacted by the Budget Control Act, which created the sequester in 2011 as part of a deal to raise the country\u2019s statutory borrowing limit.\n\nA comprehensive deficit-reduction deal, which is currently moribund but is still both Congress and the White House\u2019s stated goal, might mitigate the impact by including fast-growing programs like Medicare and Medicaid in the cuts. But belt-tightening, for now, appears to be the new normal.",

    "text": "In a speech last month, President Obama brought renewed attention to economic disparities in the United States. The gap between rich and poor is indeed substantial \u00e2\u0080\u0094 much larger than in most developed nations and much larger than it was 40 years ago. So what is the best way to help those struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder?\n\nIf we could figure out a way to do it, the most effective solution would be to increase the skills of those low-wage workers. Many studies have shown that the financial return of education is now high by historical standards. Reforming the education system so that more students graduate from high school and college is thus crucial to a more egalitarian prosperity. But upgrading the skills of the labor force is a decades-long project, not a quick fix. And educational reform is easier said than done.\n\nAs a result, those who are worried about inequality look for more immediate ways to help workers with limited skills. Before turning to President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider two other possibilities. For lack of better terms, call them Plan A and Plan B:\n\nPLAN A The government subsidizes the incomes of low-wage workers. These subsidies are financed by increasing taxes on middle- and upper-income Americans.\n\nPLAN B The government again subsidizes the incomes of low-wage workers. But under this plan, the subsidies are financed by taxing those companies that hire low-wage workers.\n\nStop reading for a moment and consider: Which of these plans would you prefer, and why? If you have a pen or pencil handy, jot down your reasons.\n\nO.K. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and now, here are my answers:\n\nTo me, Plan A is distinctly better than Plan B, which suffers from two problems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one involving fairness, and one involving efficacy.\n\nFirst, fairness: If we decide as a nation that we want to augment the income of low-wage workers, it seems only right that we all share that responsibility. Plan A does that. By contrast, Plan B concentrates the cost of the wage subsidy on a small subset of businesses and their customers. There is no good reason this group has a special obligation to help those in need.\n\nIndeed, one might argue that this group is already doing more than its share. After all, it is providing jobs to the unskilled. Asking it to do even more, while letting everyone else off the hook, seems particularly churlish.\n\nBut even putting fairness aside, there is reason to doubt the efficacy of Plan B. Taxing businesses that hire unskilled workers would alter their behavior in ways that would hurt those we are trying to help.\n\nTo avoid the tax, businesses would have an incentive to hire fewer of these workers. For example, they would have greater incentive to replace workers with labor-saving machines.\n\nIn addition, some of the tax would be passed on to customers in the form of higher prices. These customers, in turn, would have an incentive to spend more of their income elsewhere. Over time, these businesses would shrink, reducing the job opportunities for the unskilled.\n\nAll in all, the Plan B tax-and-subsidy plan sounds like a pretty bad idea. Why, you might wonder, did I bring it up? Because it is the one favored by President Obama. He calls it an increase in the minimum wage.\n\nTo be sure, the minimum wage isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly a system of taxes and subsidies. But its effects are much the same as those of Plan B. Unskilled workers earn more, and the businesses that hire them pay more. The main difference between the minimum wage and Plan B is that, under a minimum wage, the extra compensation is paid directly from the business to the worker, rather than indirectly via the government.\n\nWhen proposing to increase the minimum wage, President Obama said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no solid evidence that a higher minimum wage costs jobs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In fact, many studies suggest that it does precisely that. Mr. Obama is like a physician who prescribes a medicine based on a few studies that find no side effects while ignoring others that report debilitating effects.\n\nWhat is most disappointing about the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal is that the federal government has the option of using the much better Plan A. It is called the earned-income tax credit. Originally passed into law in 1975 and expanded substantially in the 1990s, the credit is a subsidy to low-wage workers paid by the rest of us, not just by the businesses who hire those workers.\n\nAdvocates of a higher minimum wage like to note that the current minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, is low by historical standards. That is true but beside the point. Because the earned-income tax credit has grown over time, the minimum wage is increasingly less relevant. As a nation we have switched from Plan B to the better Plan A. And a good case can be made for eliminating Plan B entirely by repealing the minimum wage.\n\nBecause \u00e2\u0080\u009ctax\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a dirty word in Washington, politicians generally prefer regulations like the minimum wage to accomplish their goals. But many regulations work like hidden taxes. Sometimes, in the process of hiding taxes, lawmakers opt for more damaging alternatives.\n\nIf, as a nation, we decide we want to do more to supplement the incomes of low-wage workers, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine. But let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s do it openly, without artifice, and with broad participation.\n\nN. GREGORY MANKIW is a professor of economics at Harvard.",

Recently, ALEC stepped away from controversial social issues such as gun laws and immigration to concentrate more on federal-state economic issues.\n\nAt ALEC\u2019s recent winter policy meeting in Washington, conservative state legislators met to talk strategy for rolling back the reach of federal agencies, with special emphasis on Environmental Protection Agency pushback. State legislators met with lobbyists for coal, utility, oil and gas firms to discuss and draft model bills, which go to the ALEC board for approval and dissemination.\n\nIn contrast, the SiX meeting featured speeches and workshops from environmental advocates, including representatives of Blue Green Alliance, the American Lung Association and political consultants dissecting new polling on climate and energy issues. Many of the workshops were closed to the press.\n\nOpen sessions included speeches by Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and video presentations from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Vermont Gov.

Buffett\u2019s company also obtained stock warrants that will likely pay out handsomely as Media General works on becoming a full-time broadcasting company.\n\nBut what of the newspapers themselves? Doctor says that Buffett got them for a steal, noting that they sold on average for about $2 million a pop \u2014 or the price of an expensive home in each of the towns where they\u2019re printed.\n\nSmall town papers make money\n\nThe story of the catastrophic decline in newspapers has been driven by metropolitan papers like the Washington Post (on whose board Buffett sat for years) where ad rates plummeted while readers embraced digital alternatives.\n\nThe experience of small towns and counties has been different. In these places, a lack of print and online competition has allowed newspapers to hold onto some of their traditional monopoly power.\n\n\u201cIn these communities, the local paper is the sole source of everyday news \u2014 from high school sports, local events or obituaries,\u201d says Gordon Crovitz, former publisher of the Wall Street Journal and founder of digital subscription service, Press+.\n\nThis lack of competition has not only meant a slower decline in their print operations, but also a longer time period to make the transition to digital. While some metropolitan papers have rushed in a panic from one ill-advised paywall strategy to another in an effort to stay alive, smaller papers have had the luxury of a wait-and-see approach. In the meantime, digital subscription strategies have become more refined.\n\nCrovitz claims that 70 publications have recently jettisoned the \u201cfree online\u201d offer for print subscribers in favor of charging 25 percent and then letting readers opt-out of the digital part of the package. He says that 90 percent of the customers elected to keep paying more.\n\nWhat all this means for Buffett is that he can treat his newspaper fleet as a longer term investment that will pay off in three to five years. Most of the papers will likely deliver a modest profit from print while Berkshire Hathaway coaxes them into a digital strategy in which a growing share of revenue comes from subscription rather than ads (Doctor predicts subscription-based revenue will soon rise from 30 to 50 percent). The company can then cut away many of the printing, distribution and other legacy costs associated with newspapers.\n\n(MORE: Warren Buffett on Succession, Stock Buybacks, and Why He Doesn\u2019t Like Gold)\n\nGoing into the newspaper business is a strange proposition for most investors but not for Buffett. This week\u2019s purchase is consistent with a number of his investment mantras, including sticking to what he knows.\n\nBuffett knows this business well from owning the Buffalo News and sitting on the board of the Washington Post, but also has more personal experience in the industry such as using $5,000 from his savings as a paper-boy to launch Berkshire Hathaway. He also claims to read five newspapers a day.\n\nBuffett also has a history of squeezing value out of traditional or troubled industries that scare off many investors. In recent years, for instance, he has bet big on airlines, autos and railroads.\n\nThere is also the question of scaling. According to Doctor, Berkshire Hathaway has long excelled at finding large scale efficiencies and the company now has enough newspapers (it also has six Nebraska papers in addition to the Omaha World-Herald) to make that happen.\n\nFinally \u2014 and this is only speculation \u2014 some might wonder if Buffett, who has been close to the Obama Administration, might enjoy owning dozens of media outlets in swing states Virginia and North Carolina in an election year.\n\nRepublished with permission from paidContent, which writes about the transformation of the media-and-entertainment industries in the digital era, with a focus on emerging-business models and technologies.\n\nPlayer FM makes podcasts look cool again\n\nPlace your orders: Facebook IPO shares set at $38",

    "text": "Roger Clemens earns 354 career win in baseball and one in court Monday.\n\nRoger Clemens emerged from a federal courthouse in Washington late Monday afternoon acquitted of all counts of perjury, obstruction of justice and making false statements before Congress. It was a throwback of 91 years, to a time when Shoeless Joe Jackson and seven of his Chicago White Sox teammates and co-defendants walked out of the Cook County courthouse in Chicago acquitted of conspiring to fix the 1919 World Series. LUPICA: CLEMENS WALKS AT PERJURY TRIAL, FANS TAKE LOSS Acquitted all of them in the court of law for their crimes against baseball, but not so in the court of public opinion. Clemens himself conceded as much in his testimony at the 2008 congressional hearing when he said: \u201cNo matter what we discuss here, I\u2019m never going to have my name restored.\u201d Nevertheless, Clemens spent millions of dollars in legal fees \u2014 refusing a plea deal \u2014 to do just that: to have his adamant denials of using performance-enhancing drugs validated by a jury of his peers. CLEMENS FOUND NOT GUILTY OF PERJURY He did so because he desperately wants to have his career and all that \u201chard work\u201d that went into those 354 wins, third-most strikeouts (4,672) and record seven Cy Young Awards get validated by being voted into the Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers Association. The problem Clemens is going to have with that, however, is that the crimes for which he was acquitted Monday had nothing to do with whether he did or didn\u2019t use steroids and, despite the court verdict, there is still considerable evidence he was a cheater. CLEMENS JUROR: PROSECUTION FAILED AT TRIAL I suspect a prime reason for the jurors \u2013 many of whom had to jar themselves to stay awake during the tedious nine-week trial \u2014 reaching their verdict so quickly was because they concluded this was a baseball issue and not a federal case. And so they threw it out, like a used baseball, right into the laps of the baseball writers, who will be Clemens\u2019 next judge and jury, beginning in January. That is when he will make his debut on the Hall of Fame ballot along with fellow alleged steroid cheats Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa, and Mike Piazza, the former Met who, though never named in the Mitchell Report, has been tainted. The writers have made a clear statement about how they feel about steroids cheats with their dismissal of Mark McGwire with less than 20% of the vote (with 75% necessary for election) and Rafael Palmeiro with just 12.6% last year. CLEMENS TIMELINE: FROM MITCHELL REPORT TO NOT GUILTY As one fellow voter said to me Monday: \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to get 75% if there is no taint on you.\u201d In that respect, Clemens\u2019 choking up upon mentioning \u201call you media guys who know me and followed my career... I put a lot of hard work into that career\u201d was telling. He wants us to believe those 162 wins and three additional Cy Youngs after the age of 35, after a 10-13 season with the Red Sox in 1996 when Boston GM Dan Duquette dissed him as \u201centering the twilight of his career,\u201d were all the product of \u201chard work.\u201d He wants to dismiss the claims of his personal trainer, Brian McNamee, that he repeatedly shot the righthander up with steroids, as the jury did, just as he wants us to \u201cmisremember\u201d like he claimed his teammate, Andy Pettitte, did of a conversation in which Clemens allegedly told him about taking human growth hormone. If nothing else, the jury\u2019s action further muddies this whole steroids/Hall of Fame controversy. A guilty verdict would have made it a whole lot easier for the baseball writers and would have given some needed credence to the Mitchell Report. Its only value was its recommendation that baseball adopt a comprehensive drug-testing program. For that, you have to credit the commissioner, Bud Selig, who wasn\u2019t interested in whether steroids cheats should or should not be in the Hall of Fame, but rather how to get steroids out of his game.\n\nRoger Clemens is elated with his not guilty verdict, but he may not like what baseball writers have to say. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP) We\u2019ll see, off this acquittal, if Clemens will be able to get past that clause on the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association Hall of Fame ballot about sportsmanship and integrity. I can\u2019t speak for my brethren, but I take that clause seriously and will vote accordingly. It has been my stance that if you want me to vote for all of these guys \u2014 Bonds, Clemens, Sosa, the rest \u2014 sheerly because they have reached Hall of Fame numbers, then take the clause out of the ballot. He can feel justifiably elated by Monday\u2019s verdict, but at the same time, Clemens might want to take a gander back at history and the statement baseball commissioner Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis issued the day after the eight \u201cBlack Sox\u201d were acquitted: \u201cRegardless of the verdict of juries, no player who throws a ballgame, no player that undertakes or promises to throw a ballgame, no player that sits in conference with a bunch of crooked players and gamblers and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball.\u201d Even though Shoeless Joe Jackson, one of the greatest hitters of all time, was acquitted in court, he never played another game in the majors, and there is no plaque for him in the Hall of Fame. Nor \u2014 unless circumstances and criteria are changed by the Hall of Fame \u2014 should there be one for Clemens.",

They are responsible and should respond.\"\n\nHe insisted that the government in Iran has been cooperating with attempts to learn Levinson's fate. The Iranian government has been trying \"to find any clue about Levinson's situation for humanitarian and security reasons, but no success,\" he said.\n\n\"We also provided all possible assistance to his family. Unfortunately this case is another America's type scandal,\" Miryusefi said.\n\nU.S. officials have raised the Levinson case with Iran repeatedly over the years, but until the AP investigation this week it was not known that Levinson was hoping to gather information in his role as an independent contract investigator who expected to be compensated by a group of analysts at the CIA.\n\nThe Iranians have also stirred confusion around the Levinson case.\n\nDuring one meeting between the U.S. and Iran, the Iranians said they were searching for Levinson and were conducting raids in Baluchistan, a mountainous region that includes parts of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan, U.S. officials said. But the U.S. ultimately concluded that there were no raids, and officials determined that the episode was a ruse by the Iranians to learn how U.S. intelligence agencies work.\n\nAfter he vanished, the CIA at first told lawmakers he had previously done contract work for the agency, but he had no current relationship with the agency and there was no connection to Iran. However, in October 2007, Levinson's lawyer discovered emails in which Levinson tells a friend at the CIA he was working to develop a source with access to the Iranian regime. The emails were turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which touched off an internal CIA investigation.\n\nThree veteran analysts were forced out of the CIA and seven others were disciplined as a result of a breach of agency rules.\n\nThe last photos and video of a bearded, emaciated Levinson were released anonymously to his family in 2010 and early 2011, and investigators say his trail has grown cold since.\n\nLevinson, who would be 65, has been missing longer than any other U.S. hostage.",

    "text": "You've heard this before: Theo Walcott looks like he's in the form of his life and ready to become an Arsenal star.\n\nThis statement is usually followed by Walcott getting injured or having his position changed or just a dip in form. That very well may happen again, but it's impossible to deny how good the Arsenal man has looked in recent weeks.\n\nEver since Walcott returned from a week out with a knee injury, he has scored four goals in three matches. He was the Man of the Match against Basel on Wednesday, a constant threat against Chelsea over the weekend and sharp against Hull. Not coincidentally, Arsenal have won those three matches by a combined score of 9-1. As Walcott has surged, so have the Gunners.\n\nIt's not as if Walcott is doing this alone. Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Alex Iwobi have all been great as well, making for a four-man attack that is ravaging opposing defenses. Their speed and ability to constantly interchange makes them difficult to track and nearly impossible to stop when they find space on the counterattack. Their skill on the ball and creativity make them a threat when space closes down, too. But the only way it works is when everyone is clicking and everyone can fit that style of play. That is makes Walcott so valuable -- he rounds out the quartet.\n\nOn Wednesday, Walcott got on the scoresheet simply by running to the goal and waiting for the cross right in front of goal. You can point to Basel's terrible defending (it was definitely very bad), but you can't dismiss how something as simple as Walcott's pace and running from deep can cause problems for defenses. Basel should have picked up Walcott, but he was on them so quickly that they didn't, and they won't be the last team to get burned by it.\n\nThe simplicity of pace and movement causing problems was even more evident on Walcott's second goal. He played a one-two with Sanchez -- a play so basic and simple that you see it in warm-ups before every match. But this time it worked like it came off the training ground because nobody on the Basel back line could keep pace with Walcott. He got in behind the defense then clinically slotted his shot off the inside of the post and in for the goal.\n\nWhat Walcott showed on Wednesday was no different than what he showed in his previous two matches. It was pace, skill and the ability to provide a direct threat even in a system that likes to possess the ball and play with quick interchanges. That also happens to be exactly what people hoped he would be since he was a teenager. Be it Arsenal or England, this was the Theo Walcott that was supposed to be a star.\n\nIt's only been three matches over the course of 12 days. It's hardly proof of a new Walcott. That he was told to prove himself as he and the Gunners discussed a new contract isn't different than the dozens of times we've heard that before, either, only for him to get hurt or spend the next three months toiling away as a center forward. But he has been undeniably great and Arsenal are thriving in part because of Walcott.",

    "text": "oscow swam in color. Hazy floodlights of Red Square mixed with the neon of casinos in Revolution Square. Light wormed its way from the underground mall in the Manezh. Spotlights crowned new towers of glass and polished stone, each tower capped by a spire. Gilded domes still floated around the Garden Ring, but all night earthmovers tore at the old city and dug widening pools of light to raise a modern, vertical Moscow more like Houston or Dubai. It was a Moscow that Pasha Ivanov had helped to create, a shifting landscape of tectonic plates and lava flows and fatal missteps.\n\nSenior Investigator Arkady Renko leaned out a window the better to see Ivanov on the pavement ten floors below. Ivanov was dead but not particularly bloody, arms and legs at odd angles. Two black Mercedeses were at the curb, Ivanov's car and an SUV for his bodyguards. It sometimes seemed to Arkady that every successful businessman and Mafia hood in Moscow had been issued two Nazi-black Mercedeses.\n\nIvanov had arrived at 9:28 p.m., gone directly up to the safest apartment in Moscow and at 9:48 p.m. plunged to the sidewalk. Arkady had measured Ivanov's distance from the building. Homicides generally hit close, having expended their energy in trying not to fall. Suicides were single-minded and landed farther out. Ivanov had almost reached the street.\n\nBehind Arkady, Prosecutor Zurin had brought drinks from the wet bar to a NoviRus senior vice president named Timofeyev and a young blonde in the living room. Zurin was as fussy as a ma\u00eetre d'; he had survived six Kremlin regimes by recognizing his best customers and smoothing out their problems. Timofeyev had the shakes and the girl was drunk. Arkady thought the gathering was a little like a party where the host had suddenly and inexplicably dived through the window. After the shock the guests carried on.\n\nThe odd man out was Bobby Hoffman, Ivanov's American assistant. Although he was worth millions of dollars, his loafers were split, his fingers were smudged with ink and his suede jacket was worn to a shine. Arkady wondered how much more time Hoffman had at NoviRus. An assistant to a dead man? That didn't sound promising.\n\nHoffman joined Arkady at the window. \"Why are there plastic bags around Pasha's hands?\"\n\n\"I was looking for signs of resistance, maybe cuts on the fingers.\"\n\nProsecutor Zurin rocked forward on the sofa. \"There is no investigation. We do not investigate suicides. There are no signs of violence in the apartment. Ivanov came up alone. He left alone. That, my friends, is a suicide in spades.\"\n\nThe girl lifted a dazed expression. Arkady had learned from the file he had on Pasha Ivanov that Rina Shevchenko was his personal interior designer, a twenty-year-old in a red leather pantsuit and high-heeled boots.\n\nTimofeyev was known as a robust sportsman, but he could have been his father, he had shrunk so much within his suit. \"Suicides are a personal tragedy. It's enough to suffer the death of a friend. Colonel Ozhogin - the head of NoviRus Security - is already flying back.\" He added to Arkady, \"Ozhogin wants nothing done until he arrives.\"\n\nArkady said, \"We don't leave a body on the sidewalk like a rug, even for the colonel.\"\n\n\"Pay no attention to Investigator Renko,\" Zurin said. \"He's the office fanatic. He's like a narcotics dog; he sniffs every bag.\"\n\nThere won't be much left to sniff here, Arkady thought. Just out of curiosity, he wondered if he could protect the bloody prints on the windowsill.\n\nTimofeyev pressed a handkerchief against his nose. Arkady saw spots of red.\n\nOpposite Ivanov's apartment was a dark office building. A man walked out of the lobby, waved to Arkady and gave a thumbs-down.\n\n\"One of your men?\" Hoffman asked.\n\n\"A detective, in case someone over there was working late and might have witnessed something.\"\n\n\"I do whatever the prosecutor says.\"\n\n\"So you think it was suicide.\"",

    "text": "The New Yorker's Evan Osnos has been working on a profile about Vice President Biden for months, and it finally published this week -- with a big focus on the vice president's role in the Ukraine crisis. Osnos conducted many interviews with Biden -- and even talked to President Obama. You should read the whole thing -- especially since the New Yorker archives are now open for browsing this summer -- but here's a look at some of the most interesting tidbits.\n\nAs the wars in the Middle East have ended, Biden has shifted to smaller foreign policy priorities, although his relationships in Ukraine have also proved invaluable. Osnos sums up his foreign policy role now as \"big assignments that may not have a huge political upside\" especially for someone who may be eying another presidential bid.\n\nObama adds, \u201cYou know, when I sent him to Ukraine for the recent inauguration of Poroshenko, and he\u2019s there, a world figure that people know, and he\u2019s signifying the importance that we place on the Ukrainian election,\u201d Obama went on. \u201cAnd then world leaders can transmit directly to him their thoughts about how we proceed. That\u2019s not necessarily helping him in Iowa. \u201d\n\nHowever, his political schmoozing skills have proved invaluable in international affairs throughout his career -- and continue to come in handy. Osnos writes, \"After so many years, he has an arsenal of opening lines that he can deploy in Baghdad, Beijing, or Wilmington. One of his favorites: 'If I had hair like yours, I\u2019d be President.'\" George Mitchell, the Maine Senator who helped bring about the Good Friday Agreement, told Osnos that he \"remembers welcoming visiting heads of state to Capitol Hill. 'I\u2019d say, \u2018Here\u2019s Senator Smith, here\u2019s Senator Jones.\u2019 When I got to Joe, the leader would look out and say, 'Hi, Joe.' \"\n\nIn his memoir, \"Duty,\" former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Biden was \"impossible not to like\u201d but he was also \u201cwrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\u201d When Osnos asked Biden about Gates, the vice president called him \u201ca really decent guy,\u201d but ... he went on to add, \"You go back, and everything in the last forty years, there\u2019s nothing that I can think of, major fundamental decisions relative to foreign policy, that I can think he\u2019s been right about!\"\n\nBiden ended his soliloquy on Gates by later saying, \u201cI can hardly wait \u2014 either in a Presidential campaign or when I\u2019m out of here \u2014 to debate Bob Gates. Oh, Jesus.\u201d\n\nAs you might have already noticed. He talks about it a lot.\n\nBut only if Hillary Clinton decides not to start her own campaign. When Osnos \"asked John McCain, who is one of Biden\u2019s close friends, if Biden would run without Clinton in the race, McCain said,'In a New York minute.' \"\n\nObama doesn't get why either Clinton or Biden would ever want to run again.\n\n\u201cI think that, for both Joe and for Hillary, they\u2019ve already accomplished an awful lot in their lives. The question is, do they, at this phase in their lives, want to go through the pretty undignifying process of running all over again.\u201d\n\nThe trials facing the President and the Vice-President, who are separated by nineteen years and a canyon in style, have brought them closer than many expected \u2014 not least of all themselves. John Marttila, one of Biden\u2019s political advisers, told me, \u201cJoe and Barack were having lunch, and Obama said to Biden, \u2018You and I are becoming good friends! I find that very surprising.\u2019 And Joe says, \u2018You\u2019re [f***ing] surprised!\u2019 \u201d\n\nHowever, Biden adds that if he ever had a \"fundamental moral disagreement\" with Obama,\"I\u2019d announce I had prostate cancer and I had to leave.\u201d\n\nBorrowing comedic tactics from \"Arrested Development,\" Biden turned an immortal line from the Bush presidency into a callback.\n\nTo illustrate his emphasis on personality as a factor in foreign affairs, Biden recalled visiting Putin at the Kremlin in 2011: \u201cI had an interpreter, and when he was showing me his office I said, \u2018It\u2019s amazing what capitalism will do, won\u2019t it? A magnificent office!\u2019 And he laughed. As I turned, I was this close to him.\u201d Biden held his hand a few inches from his nose. \u201cI said, \u2018Mr. Prime Minister, I\u2019m looking into your eyes, and I don\u2019t think you have a soul.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cYou said that?\u201d I asked. It sounded like a movie line.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, positively,\u201d Biden said, and continued, \u201cAnd he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said, \u2018We understand one another.\u2019 \u201d Biden sat back, and said, \u201cThis is who this guy is!\u201d\n\nBiden isn't a fan of the more rebellious additions to the Senate.\n\nHe told Osnos, \"I\u2019ll never forget the first time I heard someone on the floor of the Senate refer to the President as Bubba.\" The profile also notes that \"Biden\u2019s friendships were so varied that he was the only senator who was asked to speak at funerals for both Strom Thurmond, the former segregationist, and Frank Lautenberg, the New Jersey Democrat, who called Biden 'the only Catholic Jew.' \"\n\nJaime Fuller reports on national politics for \"The Fix\" and Post Politics.

    "text": "To descend into the Danakil Depression is to step into another world.\n\nThe thick warm air, the hazy sky and the rugged empty mountains that gradually give way to the immensity of a white, shimmering salt desert all leave the traveller in awe of this cruel yet fascinating landscape. Overlapping the Afar region of northeastern Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti, this is the lowest point in Africa and one of the hottest places on Earth.\n\nVenturing deep into this inhospitable land requires a well organized plan. Getting stuck with no back-up vehicle, no satellite communication or simply not enough water could become life threatening within a matter of hours.\n\nI started my trip from the city of Mekele in the northern Tigray region of Ethiopia. I had not come to explore the area as a tourist. Instead, I was there to document the caravans of thousands of camels which for centuries have descended deep into the depression to extract salt. Mekele was the place where I had to find a good 4\u00d74 vehicle, a driver and enough water and food to be on the road for six days. Most importantly, I had to find a reliable fixer, someone who knew the region well and spoke the local language but who also had to be familiar with the salt trade and could maneuver well within complex Afar clan dynamics.\n\nI had briefly met Mohammed on a previous trip some years back, and we stayed in touch ever since. His company for this assignment proved to be invaluable as he translated interviews, and negotiated with government officials and clan elders. After a four-hour ride from Mekele, we arrived in the small but fast expanding desert town of Berahile in the Afar territory in the afternoon. This is where the camel caravans drop their loads of salt after marching for days across the depression.\n\nFrom Berahile, trucks collect the mineral and transport it to the city of Mekele from where it is distributed to the rest of the country.\n\nOn the way, I was astonished at how far the construction of a new paved road had come along. Just a few years back in 2010, most of the journey to Berahile was on a rough steep route, but now I traveled on freshly laid tarmac for half the way. I couldn\u2019t help thinking about how this new road would affect the region. Surely it will bring some much needed development, helping with the transit of goods, businesses and infrastructure. But what about the thousands of Muslim Afar and Christian Tigrayans from the highlands who depend on the old ways of the salt trade? Would trucks one day replace camels, mules and donkeys and be part of a new, more efficient way of transporting salt from the desert to the highland?\n\nAs thoughts became questions, Mohammed explained that he believed this would never happen. All aspects of society in this region come down to clan politics; everything is decided by clan leaders and the local administration. For this reason, Mohammed believed that the community would never allow the caravan trade to disappear, as that would affect the thousands of people who depend on it. After meeting and introducing myself to the clan elders and administrators in the town, it was decided that I would depart by foot with the caravans the next morning.\n\nFor protection against possible bandit attacks and for assistance on the way, I was introduced to Hussein, my guide for the next few days and to Mussa, an armed police reservist who in his younger days was a rebel fighter with the Afar Liberation Front. We walked with countless caravans of camels through the day across vast dried valleys and canyons. Hussein explained the vital importance of the river that we followed through the afternoon, saying it was the lifeline of the region. Once you leave it and head into the salt plains, drinking water is impossible to find.\n\nThat evening we made camp in the company of a caravan by the banks of the river. We shared coffee and a quick dinner of pitta bread and noodles, then were quickly carried off to sleep by our exhaustion. At 6a.m. we were back on the road, taking advantage of the cool temperatures to cover as much distance as possible. Luckily for us, a car was waiting at the end of the valley for the last 20 kilometers (12 miles) of rocky, flat terrain before reaching the great salt plains of the depression.\n\nI felt that having been on the road with the caravans for a day and a half was enough to be able to understand the difficulties of the journey that the salt merchants faced on a daily basis. We reached Hamad-Ile in the afternoon, a small village on the edge of the desert, which is the last outpost for water and food before proceeding east into the depression. This was going to be a comfortable base to spend the night compared to the rocky terrain where we had woken up the previous morning.\n\nAt dusk the next day, we witnessed a spectacular scene of thousands of camels, mules, donkeys, herders, salt merchants, salt shapers and extractors venturing together into the vast, endless plains. They were all trying to reach a suitable spot where the salt was compact enough to be extracted. It was a march of several hours deep in the desert. The sooner they reached the spot, the more time they had to extract as many slabs of salt as possible, load them onto their animals and start the two days\u2019 journey back to the town of Berahile.\n\nThe landscape here was incredibly different from when I had started my trip a couple of days back. It was a shimmering white expanse, with water mirages on the horizon playing tricks with your mind. The white hazy sky melted with the whiteness of the desert, giving a surreal feeling that sky and earth had touched and become one reality, indistinguishable from one another. Amid this feeling of spectacular emptiness, the salt caravans moved in a slow but constant procession, cutting across the whiteness of the cracked desert.\n\nIt was hard to imagine that they would stop somewhere in the desolate plains and work through the day in temperatures sometimes exceeding 50 degrees centigrade (122 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThe price: thousands of slabs of salt to sell and to transport to the four corners of the country in a matter of days. This is the \u201cwhite gold\u201d of Ethiopia, as it used to be called when salt was used as a form of currency throughout the region.",

    "text": "There could soon be changes to the rules that affect U.S.-bound Canadian snowbirds.\n\nA Canada-U.S. agreement is in the works to share information on who's entering each respective country, and when, for example. The Entry Exit Initiative already covers non-citizens of the two countries, but the plan to start covering citizens as well has been delayed.\n\nOnce that's in effect, the U.S. government will be able to easily check whether snowbirds overstay their welcome.\n\nThe Canada Border Services Agency cautions that legislative and regulatory changes need to happen before that can be implemented, and says it will provide additional information about the timing \"in due course.\"\n\nThere have also been initiatives in Congress over the last few years to extend the time some Canadians can spend in the U.S.\n\nWhile those proposals are still being debated by American legislators, Canadian snowbirds continue to head to the U.S. in droves under the current rules, which have been in place for some time.\n\nHere's a short checklist for snowbirds about the rules on visas, taxation, insurance, and so on.\n\nUsually a maximum of 182 days, or about six months during a 12-month period. Those days can be amassed during one trip or they could be the sum of several trips.\n\nPeople from countries other than Canada are allowed to stay a maximum of 90 days.\n\nThe Canadian and U.S. governments have plans to exchange information on when their citizens leave and enter the other country. Before the plan gets implemented, legislative and regulatory changes need to happen. (CBC)\n\nThe American Internal Revenue Service has a complicated way of determining this, and a form that may let snowbirds off the hook.\n\nComplete the form and you can spend the full 182 days in the U.S. without paying U.S. income tax.\n\nIf you want to follow the formula, called the \"substantial presence test,\" here is how to do the calculation.\n\nThe test determines whether you have been in the U.S. long enough to be considered a U.S. resident for tax purposes. The IRS determines this by using an unusual formula that calculates the total number of 'days' you have spent in the U.S. over a three-year span, and that number must add up to 183 or more.\n\nThey calculate the sum as follows:\n\nIf the sum of those three numbers totals 183 or more, the IRS may insist you file a U.S. tax return.\n\nWhen the IRS explains the test on their website, they give an example of someone staying 120 days each year for three years, which would total 180 (by adding 120; 120 divided by 3; plus 120 divided by 6) and mean they are not considered a resident.\n\nHere's another example. If a snowbird spent 180 days in the U.S. in both 2014 and 2013, they should limit their U.S. time to 92 days in 2015 to avoid being classified as a U.S. resident by the IRS.\n\nWhether they own or rent, Canadian snowbirds usually take steps to avoid being considered a U.S. resident for tax purposes, like filing an IRS form that establishes their closer connection to Canada. (Susagna Guardiola)\n\nThere are exemptions available for students, teachers and diplomats, and for someone who is unable to leave because they develop a medical condition while in the U.S., but for serious snowbirds, the best strategy for maintaining non-resident status is filing out that IRS form, the \"Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens,\" better known to snowbirds as Form 8840.\n\nSnowbirds establish their closer connection to Canada through things like having a permanent home, personal belongings, affiliations, family, business, driver's licence and having voted in Canada.\n\nThe form needs to be filed with the IRS every year snowbirds spend time in the U.S.\n\nB.C., Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Nova Scotia require at least five months of residence in the province to continue health insurance coverage. Newfoundland and Labrador requires only four months.\n\nThe good weather, the golf courses and the scenery lure Canadian snowbirds to place like Rancho Mirage, California. But their U.S. stay is limited to 182 days. (Daniel Schwartz/CBC)\n\nThe other provinces and territories require six months' residency, but Quebec does not count trips of less than 21 days as non-residency.\n\nSome provinces will allow longer periods out-of-province if a written request is made by the resident.\n\nTo get provincial health benefits back after losing them usually requires living in the province for three months, at which point coverage begins again.\n\nThat depends on the policy they buy. CBC News has had many horror stories about Canadians who needed medical treatment in the U.S.\n\nThe key things to watch for are issues around pre-existing conditions and the limitations and exclusions of the coverage.\n\nThat also depends on the individual policy, but in general, most require extra measures by a resident away for a long trip.\n\nIf no one is living in the house after the snowbirds fly away, some insurers require someone (a family member or acquaintance) to regularly do a walk-through or check the property.\n\nAt least twice in recent years, legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress, but not passed, to extend the length-of-stay limit to 240 days for Canadian citizens over 50 years old and their spouses.\n\nHowever, that proposal is now caught up in the debate over U.S. immigration laws. Now that the White House is bypassing Congress on the issue, and using executive orders, Canadian snowbirds shouldn't hold their breath.\n\nChecklists for snowbirds about what to do around their home, with their personal finances, for example, abound on the web. Two of the most detailed publications are available free on the Canadian Snowbirds Association website.",

    "text": "Fifa is facing calls to rerun the bidding competition for the 2022 World Cup after allegations that a former top Qatari football official paid $5m (\u00a32.98m) to win support for the nation's campaign to host the event.\n\nLabour said Qatar should lose the 2022 World Cup and urged those involved to resign if the Fifa corruption allegations detailed in the Sunday Times were true. Clive Efford, the shadow sport minister, said the new revelations \"called the governance of football into question\".\n\n\"No one will have any confidence in a Fifa investigation run by Sepp Blatter,\" he said. \"If these allegations are true then those involved should resign.\"\n\nLord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, described Fifa as a \"bit of a cesspit\" and suggested there was evidence of a \"very serious crime\" following the reports.\n\nHe told Sky News's Murnaghan programme: \"The idea of another voting session with all this money sloshing around is almost too much to bear. But on the other hand, if I can pretend to be a prosecutor again for a minute, this is evidence of a very serious crime. And the fact that the allegation is that they used dollars, US dollars, means that the justice department in Washington has jurisdiction over this \u2026 the United States of course are in the World Cup finals. If the justice department started to take an interest in this, I think Fifa would feel the heat very, very quickly.\"\n\nThe Sunday Times said it had obtained millions of emails and other documents relating to alleged payments made by Mohamed bin Hammam, the then Fifa executive member for Qatar. The paper said Bin Hammam, also the former Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president, used slush funds to pay out the cash to top football officials to win a \"groundswell\" of support for Qatar's World Cup bid.\n\nJohn Whittingdale, chairman of the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, called for the bidding competition to be held again and said it would be impossible for Fifa to brush aside the revelations.\n\n\"It is a further demonstration of the need for a complete change in the way that Fifa operates but also that there is now an overwhelming case that the decision as to where the World Cup should be held in 2022 should be run again,\" Whittingdale told the paper.\n\nThe sports minister, Helen Grant, said: \"These appear to be very serious allegations. It is essential that major sporting events are awarded in an open, fair and transparent manner.\"\n\nThe allegations come less than two weeks before the start of the World Cup in Brazil and bring fresh scrutiny on the 2010 vote, which gave football's biggest tournament to the tiny desert state. The process is under investigation by Fifa's independent ethics prosecutor, Michael Garcia.\n\nQatar has also come under fire for its labour laws, in the wake of an international outcry over conditions for migrant workers before the 2022 World Cup, which followed a Guardian investigation into workplace abuse in the Gulf state.\n\nBin Hammam is no longer a committee member of world football's governing body after being caught up in a corruption scandal surrounding his failed campaign for its presidency in 2011. The Sunday Times alleged that he exploited his position as an executive committee member to help to secure votes from key members of its 24-man ruling committee that helped Qatar win the right to host the World Cup. Qatar defeated bids from the US, Japan, South Korea and Australia.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, Bin Hammam used 10 slush funds controlled by his private company and cash handouts to make dozens of payments of up to $200,000 into accounts controlled by the presidents of 30 African football associations who influenced how Africa's four executive members would vote. He also allegedly hosted lavish junkets for these African officials at which he handed out almost $400,000 in cash.\n\nLast month, Blatter said it had been a mistake to choose Qatar for the World Cup, forcing Fifa to try to limit the damage. \"Yes, it was a mistake of course, but one makes lots of mistakes in life,\" said Blatter, Fifa's president, in an interview with the Swiss broadcaster RTS. \"The technical report into Qatar said clearly it was too hot but the executive committee \u2013 with a large majority \u2013 decided all the same to play it in Qatar.\"\n\nBlatter, who is standing for another term as president in 2015, is believed to have voted for the USA to host the 2022 World Cup, while his prospective rival for the presidency, Uefa's Michel Platini, voted for Qatar and has been closely linked with the plans for the 2022 tournament.\n\nThe Fifa inspection team ranked Qatar as the only \"high-risk\" option overall, yet it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 voting members of the executive committee in December 2010. The Fifa president said it was now \"probable\" that it would be played in the winter rather than the summer due to the heat. Blatter insisted, however, that Qatar, which spent huge sums on ambassadors and development programmes, had not \"bought\" the World Cup.\n\nJim Boyce, Fifa vice-president, said he would be in favour of rerunning the vote if allegations that widespread corruption was involved in the bid were proved. Boyce, who was not on the executive committee of the world governing body at the time of the vote, said Garcia, would have to widen his investigation.\n\nBoyce told Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme: \"As a member currently of the Fifa executive committee, we feel that any evidence whatsoever that people involved were bribed to do a certain vote, all that evidence should go to Michael Garcia, whom Fifa have given full authority to.\n\n\"If Garcia's report comes up and his recommendations are that wrongdoing happened for that vote for the 2022 World Cup, I certainly as a member of the executive committee would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation was for a revote.\"\n\nAnna Soubry, minister for defence personnel, welfare and veterans, said: \"Somebody somewhere has got to get a serious grip on Fifa about the way that they run these competitions.\"\n\nJim Murphy, the shadow international development secretary, also called for a rethink if the allegations were found to be true.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics: \"If these allegations and the contents of the emails that the Sunday Times now has turn out to be true there can be no question about this. The thing wasn't done fairly, it wasn't done openly and it would have to be cancelled and rerun entirely. The building that is happening in Qatar should be paused and they should have a fair and open competition.\"\n\nQatar's World Cup officials said the bid committee had \"always upheld the highest standard of ethics and integrity\".\n\nThe country's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said: \"Mohamed bin Hammam played no official or unofficial role in Qatar's 2022 bid committee. As was the case with every other member of Fifa's executive committee, our bid team had to convince Mr Bin Hammam of the merits of our bid.\n\n\"We are cooperating fully with Mr Garcia's ongoing investigation and remain totally confident that any objective inquiry will conclude we won the bid to host the 2022 Fifa World Cup fairly.\n\n\"Following today's newspaper articles, we vehemently deny all allegations of wrongdoing. We will take whatever steps are necessary to defend the integrity of Qatar's bid and our lawyers are looking into this matter. The right to host the tournament was won because it was the best bid and because it is time for the Middle East to host its first Fifa World Cup.\"",

Tuesday night at Town Hall saw the first New York performance of ''Il Corsaro,'' which, along with ''Alzira,'' has generally been dismissed as the composer's weakest work. This concert performance followed the American premiere with the same forces Saturday night at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, L.I.\n\n''Il Corsaro'' will be staged this spring as part of the San Diego Opera's Verdi series.\n\nIt cannot be said that the public shows an insatiable desire for these operas; Town Hall was not full, and many of those present seemed to have come for Carlo Bergonzi, the singer of the title part and the star of the evening.\n\nStill, ''Il Corsaro'' is by no means negligible, as indicated by reports of its revival in the 1960's (it had not been heard for 110 years before a Venetian concert performance in 1963) and a solid new Philips recording. And Tuesday's performance served the music well.\n\nThe opera has been dismissed for several reasons. Verdi himself appeared to have brushed it aside at the time of its premiere, in Trieste in 1848. He had earlier intended to set to music this libretto based on Byron's poem ''The Corsair,'' but then took up other projects. When he returned to it, the circumstances were not ideal and he had grown, musically, beyond this type of libretto. The opera sputtered along for five years and then disappeared, and an orchestral score has still not been published. Thus most scholars who scorned it did so on the basis of its reputation and its vocal score. But letters have recently turned up indicating that Verdi cared at least to some extent for the music.\n\nThe libretto is about a noble pirate who battles the Moslems, is loved by a harem maid but in turn loves another, and who finally kills himself after his true love poisons herself when she thinks he is dead. This was treated with almost laconic concision by Francesco Maria Piave, the librettist, and that concision makes it almost impossible for any real characters to emerge. There are fiercely dramatic confrontations, however, and some positively glorious melodies and ensembles. And Verdi's formal experiments and orchestration are very striking.\n\nTuesday's performance was by the Long Island Opera Society conducted by David Lawton. Mr. Lawton is a Verdi scholar and has a real feeling for the shape, thrust and flow of Verdi's phrasing. Unfortunately his largely student orchestra sounded pretty scrawny, although it played carefully and accurately. The chorus was worse - ludicrous, in fact, in its earnest collegiate articulation of passages meant to be sung with passion and flair. Still, with all the soloists in full cry, the big ensembles made a mighty enough noise, and the orchestra could support the soloists adequately. And the soloists were first-rate.\n\nThe title role never rises above A in exposed music, and apparently the opera's unpopularity precluded a tradition of interpolated higher notes. This meant Mr. Bergonzi's insecure top was not tested, and he sang superbly, with all his innate beauty of voice, scrupulousness of musicianship, idiomatic sensitivity of phrasing and sumptuous clarity of declamation.\n\nThe other singers were less well known, but fully honorable. Most commanding was Sarah Reese as Gulnara, the heroic harem girl. Miss Reese, who looked rather like Billie Holiday without the gardenia, has a gorgeous soprano, brilliant, rich and agile, with only a slightly husky register break to betray her immaturity. It would be interesting to hear her as Odabella in ''Attila.''\n\nCarolyn Val-Schmidt, a clearer, purer soprano, sang the Corsair's love, Medora, and James Dietsch, a New York City Opera baritone, boomed out the wicked Pasha Seid's music with stern authority.",

    "text": "It would be hard to find anyone who doesn't think Paul Newman was a super movie star. It would also be hard to find anyone in the marketing business who doesn't think Paul Newman was a super branding guy.\n\nWhen he launched his line of Newman's Own products in 1982 he understood that clearly defining a brand's purpose would clearly differentiate it in the minds of consumers, especially in categories as commoditized as those in which he competed, like salad dressing, lemonade and pasta sauce.\n\nThis thought came to mind recently when I read about the new ad campaign for Newman's brand, the first initiative since the actor's death two years ago. \"Let the food speak for itself,\" as it's cleverly titled, builds on the company's initial purpose to make stuff that tastes really good, the profits of which are used to do really good things for people, most notably the kids at his Hole in the Wall Camps. While I admit that it certainly helps to have Paul's charming, irreverent countenance on all of the brand packaging, I still maintain that there is a lot we can learn from this master of branding. It's a very strong brand on every level that counts.\n\nTo begin with, Newman's Own is built on a simple, believable promise. The products that Paul concocted with his buddy, author A. E. Hotchner, are old family recipes. In fact, the company got its start after friends suggested that the two fellows market the delicious salad dressing they had been making and bottling at home and giving out as gifts. The products that followed are also in categories that are believable as homemade creations. It's easy to imagine P.L. and A. E., as they billed themselves, hard at it in the kitchen discussing the best recipe for a chocolate chip cookie or a spicy marinara sauce and then donning aprons and getting down to the business at hand. It makes a nifty mental picture.\n\nAlso nifty is the way this simple promise has been executed across all points of customer touch, another of the measures of powerful branding well understood by this company. Everything having to do with the brand has been brought to life in exquisite alignment with its promise, starting with the name: Newman's Own. It is Paul Newman's own, and his signature on every wrapper substantiates this point. The packaging itself looks like someone designed it in the same kitchen in which the food was cooked up--no hint of slickness or artificiality, literal or figurative. Most important of all is that the food tastes great (although our family pet would have to vouch for the dog food!). And when you're selling food, focusing on taste is a given, another basic tenet of the smart branding being followed by the folks who successfully carry on in Paul's stead.\n\nPerhaps most interesting when looking at why the Newman's Own brand is successful, even after its founder's passing, is how ahead of his time the actor-brander was in linking his brand promise to its purpose and making this the hallmark of his endeavor. He understood that he needed a purpose for his organization, beyond the actual food and the shiny name under which it was marketed. While many companies are philanthropic, especially in this uber-socially conscious era, Newman's Own is defined by its philanthropic purpose. Consumers are deeply aware of what the brand stands for, and they care deeply about it, which is central to its continuing success.\n\nEven back in 1982 when the number of product choices and media choices were far fewer, Paul Newman recognized that he couldn't compete on good-tasting products alone. There had to be another way to differentiate his brand of pretzels and coffee and frozen pizza from all the rest. Good food that does good is how most people think about this brand. Given his cheeky humor, Paul, without any false pretense, put it forward as \"Shameless exploitation in pursuit of the common good.\" A tagline that's as on-brand as every other of the company's branding initiatives.\n\nNow, with all due respect, we are talking about Paul Newman. He got the Sundance Kid to jump off a cliff. He conned Doyle Lonnegan into falling for his sting. He would certainly have been able to get a number of consumers to buy whatever goodies he was selling. The point, however, is that he got millions of consumers to buy the products he was selling under the Newman's Own label because he knew he would need more than his baby blues to build and maintain a winning brand. He started with a simple, believable promise that was relevant to people. He made sure this promise was executed brilliantly in all aspects of the branding. And he aligned his promise with a purpose that helped differentiate it in a highly competitive marketplace.\n\nWhile his name and stature as a star might have helped at the beginning of the brand's run, it was adhering to the basic rules of branding that made this company a star on supermarket shelves.\n\nAllen Adamson is managing director of the New York office of Landor Associates, a brand consultancy and design firm. He is also the author of BrandDigital and BrandSimple.",

After more than a decade as the most widely used law enforcement vehicle in the nation, the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Crown Vic, as it has become known \u00e2\u0080\u0094 went out of production in 2011.\n\nAnd this summer, through whatever mysterious karma shapes the police universe, Trooper Randy Elkins was assigned to be the driver and keeper of the last Crown Vic bought by the Washington State Patrol. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of the end of an era,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trooper Elkins said from behind the wheel of Unit 606 on a recent morning during rush-hour patrol here in eastern Washington, near the Idaho border. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy goal is to keep it to the end, right to the last mile.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaw enforcement is a practical, left-brain business of protocol and procedure. But a discussion of the Crown Vic brings out a romantic side. The traditions and symbols of life behind the badge become intertwined with its tools. Two tons of rear-wheel drive and a V-8 engine up front made for a machine that could feel safe at any speed, a reliable nonhuman partner when things got crazy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was a big part of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lt. Dan McCollum, the fleet manager for the Kansas Highway Patrol. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you had any severe crash or a hairy situation with a Crown Vic, you could become real attached to it when it performed well and either saved your life or protected you from great bodily harm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere have been other flings. In the mid-1960s, the Plymouth Belvedere became an iconic police vehicle, stamped into the popular culture by television shows like \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdam-12,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where the whole world, at least in early episodes, was seen from behind the windshield of one. Joe Friday and Bill Gannon of \u00e2\u0080\u009cDragnet\u00e2\u0080\u009d fame cruised in a Ford Fairlane.\n\nFor Trooper Elkins, part of the Crown Vic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appeal is its sheer size, which is one reason, in the era of constricted government budgets, that the Crown Vic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reign came to an end. Compared with lighter and more fuel-efficient newer designs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 notably the Chevrolet Caprice, which the Washington State Patrol is now buying \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Crown Vic increasingly seemed like a relic.\n\nWhat you got in return for 13 or so miles per gallon, though, was legroom, important for a 6-foot-4 officer like Trooper Elkins, and ample space to serve as a rolling locker room of police equipment.\n\nFar more than it ever was in Joe Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s era, or Andy Griffith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for that matter (he and Barney Fife drove around Mayberry in a black and white Ford Galaxie), an officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vehicle is also now an office. Mobile communications technology means there is no need to return to the base or precinct for paperwork.\n\nAnd the office is jammed: the laptop at Trooper Elkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right elbow, with the printer below, is positioned right in front of the unit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and 12-gauge shotgun, locked up between the front seats. Radio, video and radar equipment take up more room. Extra handcuffs are stuffed into door compartments. The trunk is filled with roadside emergency supplies: flares, a shovel, a first-aid kit.\n\nYes, the Caprice is probably peppier, Trooper Elkins conceded. But it is not all about 0 to 60. Like his wide-brimmed trooper hat, which he carefully puts on as he exits the car to approach a vehicle he has pulled over, the Crown Vic, he said, declares his identity. Because Ford stopped making the car for the consumer market, the Police Interceptor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distinctive grille is enough to stir law-abiding impulses when spotted in a speeder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rearview mirror.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of history behind the uniform \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what we wear and the way we wear it, even the way we polish our buttons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Trooper Elkins, the son of a mechanic and a grocery store worker, who grew up here in Spokane, about a four-hour drive east of Seattle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same with the vehicle. It projects an image.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Kansas Highway Patrol so loved its Crown Vics that it sought out and bought the last of the last \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the final police-equipped Interceptor ever to leave the Ford line in 2011. Mr. McCollum, the fleet manager, said the department considered using the vehicle for regular duty, but decided that it deserved an easier road, safe from the risk of damage and mayhem. It is driven, a little, but gently, he said \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mostly to parades, recruitment drives and special occasions when ceremony counts more than horsepower.\n\nBut here in Unit 606, designated by Trooper Elkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s badge number, the road still beckons. The car, which had some down time before Trooper Elkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assignment, covers about 1,000 miles a week and has 27,000 miles logged, some by a previous driver. At that rate, the 140,000-mile fleet-designated retirement cutoff could come within a couple of years, barring damage, which is always a risk in the line of duty.\n\nIn the meantime, the tree-shaped air-freshener hanging in an equipment-free space on the passenger side speaks of hope eternal. It reads, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew car scent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

    "text": "There are two sorts of cholesterol: \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d. High density lipoprotein (HDL) is good cholesterol. It takes cholesterol away from your arteries to the liver to be broken down. So a high level of HDL cholesterol can be good for your heart health.\n\nLow density lipoprotein (LDL) is bad cholesterol. It takes cholesterol from your liver to your body tissues. If your blood is high in bad cholesterol it can build up in the walls of your blood vessels, causing them to narrow.\n\nTo get an accurate reading of your levels it is best to be tested by your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist. When you\u2019re checked, be sure to find out both your HDL and LDL cholesterol levels.\n\nTo keep your heart healthy it\u2019s important your LDL cholesterol remains low and your HDL cholesterol stays high. Guidelines from the Joint British Societies suggest you should aim for a total cholesterol level of under 5 mmol/l and a LDL level of less than 3 mmol/l to keep your heart healthy.\n\nIn fact, statistics from the British Heart Foundation show that the average cholesterol level of men in the UK are 5.3mmol/l, while women have an average level of 5.4 mmol/l; as such, more than 50 per cent of the adult population has cholesterol higher than the recommended.\n\nLower levels are recommended for those that have had a heart attack or have heart problems. Which brings us that second question: \u201cwhy should I care?\u201d.\n\nAs mentioned above, when levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood are too high, fatty deposits can build up in your arteries. In turn, this can narrow those arteries, making it harder for your heart to pump blood around your body. This could lead to heart disease, high blood pressure and other types of cardiovascular problems. All of which are well worth avoiding.\n\nThe most common cause of high cholesterol levels is eating too much saturated fat, but there are several other factors that influence your blood cholesterol levels, including a family history of high cholesterol, diabetes and kidney problems.\n\nThere are various answers if you suffer from any of those medical syndromes, and hopefully your doctor is already keeping a close eye on your heart health and prescribing any appropriate medication. If not, it\u2019s well worth booking a chat with your GP.\n\nOther possible causes of high cholesterol, however, include age, lack of exercise, and being overweight. While there\u2019s not much we can do about ageing (yet\u2026), it can often go hand-in-hand with a general decline in fitness and physical condition, which can certainly be helped by an appropriate diet and exercise regime.\n\nThe second two problems, though, are relatively easy to tackle, given a bit of willpower. Which brings us to a third, hugely important question:\n\nWhat can I do to lower my cholesterol level, and keep it low?\n\nLuckily, this one\u2019s easy to answer without too much scientific terminology. Making some pretty straightforward changes to your diet and lifestyle can improve your heart health and quality of life.\n\nThe first step is your diet. Are you eating a lot of processed foods such as biscuits and cakes? Does your dinner plate contain a lot of fried food? Or your breakfast plate? And do you go weak at the knees over treacle pudding or chips?\n\nWhile nobody wants to spoil your fun, that\u2019s exactly the sort of diet that may well lead to high levels of cholesterol. So the sensible thing to do is cut down on the fatty, sugary stuff and try to introduce more fruit and vegetables and pulses, such as beans, peas and nuts, into your everyday diet.\n\nWholegrain foods are good, too, including cereals, wholemeal or granary bread, oats (in the form of porridge, perhaps) and brown rice. All these are full of essential vitamins and minerals and, importantly, are full of energy and fibre, the latter of which can help lower cholesterol.\n\nMeat is not necessarily a bad thing \u2013 but try to choose lower-fat cuts such as skinless chicken breasts and only eat foods such as lamb chops occasionally, cutting off any fat and leaving it on the side of your plate.\n\nBut one thing that is definitely worth doing is introducing a nice bit of fish, particularly oily fish such as mackerel, fresh tuna or salmon. It\u2019s fantastic for heart health, because it is packed with essential omega 3 oil.\n\nWhat else can you do? Cutting down on salt is a fine idea. Watch out for those salty, savoury snacks and keep an eye on what\u2019s printed on packets and tins \u2014 an adult\u2019s daily recommended dose of salt, for instance, is 6g. If you\u2019re looking at a packet that has almost that much all by itself, put it down and sneak quietly away.\n\nThere\u2019s more you can do to be healthier. You don\u2019t really need to be told that smoking is a bad idea, of course. But it is. There, you\u2019ve been told again. The occasional glass of wine or beer is by no means a bad thing, but if you\u2019re drinking more than a couple of units (that\u2019s the equivalent of a pint of ordinary beer, or a smallish glass of wine) a day, you should think about cutting back a bit.\n\nThe next cholesterol-lowering step, quite literally, is a bit of healthy exercise. You don\u2019t have to join a gym or a special exercise class, simply work more activity into your everyday life.\n\nExperts recommend we should be aiming to be moderately active for 30 minutes a day, most days of the week. That means anything from a short run to walking an extra stop on your normal bus journey. A refreshing regular swim, or a spot of gardening. A dance class or a session of table tennis. A trip to the shops on your bicycle or even simply some vigorous housework.\n\nStuck inside? A stationary bicycle\u2019s not a bad idea at all, and you can even watch television while pedalling in the warm and dry. After all, your heart\u2019s a muscle like any other, and giving it a bit of regular, moderate exercise will get it pumping more strongly and reliably, meaning that there will be less stress on your cardiovascular system as a whole. And you\u2019ll feel fitter and more active too. It\u2019s not all about your cholesterol level \u2014 though that\u2019s well worth thinking about.\n\nOf course, adding foods such as the Flora pro.activ range to your diet will help too; they contain plant sterols, which are scientifically proven to lower cholesterol when eaten every day. There\u2019s more information at www. floraproactiv.co.uk\n\nSo now you know what cholesterol is all about, you can see how vital it is. And how with a few lifestyle changes \u2013 for instance more exercise and a healthy diet \u2013 you can get high cholesterol levels down and keep them that way.

    "text": ", Money Magazine staff reporter\n\n(Money Magazine) -- If you are among the 6.5 million homeowners who took out a low-rate adjustable-rate mortgage during the housing boom, you've probably spent the past couple of years waiting for your day of reckoning to come.\n\nAfter all, you've probably heard repeated warnings that when your ARM resets your payments would spike dramatically: an especially big problem if you used a low-rate ARM to stretch for a home you could barely afford.\n\nThe good news is that scenario hasn't come to pass. Instead, interest rates have fallen to record lows, and when your ARM resets you'll probably see your monthly nut fall, not rise.\n\nBut once the economy stabilizes, the government will start peeling back the policies that are keeping mortgage rates low.\n\n\"Eventually rates are going to go up very significantly,\" says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com. The Mortgage Bankers Association predicts fixed mortgage rates will reach 5.9% by the end of 2010 and 6.3% by the end of 2011.\n\nTo see what could happen to your payments later on, look on your mortgage documents to find the cap, or the number of points your rate can move in any given year after the first reset (one or two is typical), as well as the lifetime cap on your loan. Then figure out if you should refinance now and what kind of mortgage you should get if you do.\n\nYou plan to move in the next three years. In that case, the few thousand dollars you'll pay to refinance is likely to exceed any extra interest you'll pay on the mortgage before you move.\n\nYou have less than 20% equity in your home. If you bought in the past few years and real estate values in your area have taken a big hit, you may not qualify for the best rates. \"That makes refinancing less attractive,\" says Wilton, Conn. mortgage broker Tim Malburg, Homeowners with a jumbo mortgage (more than $417,000 in most areas) are held to an even higher equity standard.\n\nRefi to a 5/1 arm if ...\n\nYou'll be in your home for three to five more years. In mid-September, ARMs that were fixed for the first five years cost about half a percentage point less than 30-year fixed-rate loans. Over a five-year period, that could save you almost $10,000 on a $300,000 mortgage.\n\nYou have a jumbo loan. These large mortgages can feel like a rip-off right now, since rates for 30-year fixed jumbos are about a percentage point higher than those for smaller loans -- an unusually wide spread, says Keith Gumbinger, vice president at HSH Associates.\n\nThat's because the government has been purchasing loans backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which has artificially driven down conventional-mortgage rates.\n\nIf you need a jumbo mortgage you'd knock about three-quarters of a percentage point off your rate by taking a 5/1 ARM. That would save about $3,300 a year for a half-million-dollar loan.\n\nRefi to a fixed-rate loan if ...\n\nYou might be less attractive to a lender later on. If you'll need to take a big loan to pay your kid's college tuition, say, or think you might get laid off -- then it's worth doing the refi while you have the chance.\n\nYou'll be in your home five years from now. While most experts think that rates will stay low for a while, they're not likely to get much lower, and there's no guarantee they won't jump unexpectedly.\n\nIf you're planning to stay longer than five years, go with a 30-year fixed to eliminate any interest-rate risk, since rates on seven- and 10-year ARMs are only a notch lower than those on 30-year loans. And if you have any doubts about your time frame, lock in. After all, you don't want to be in this same predicament five or so years down the road.\n\nYou'll pay more to lock in a fixed-rate mortgage today. But a couple of years from now, holding on to that adjustable-rate loan could get costly.",

    "text": "Don Budreski earlier this year noticed a roughly three-story-tall utility pole pop up across the street from his Baltimore electronics shop.\n\n\u201cIt was just odd,\u201d he said of the slender, steel post. \u201cI thought, \u2018What are they putting that thing there for?\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Budreski had caught a glimpse of a key element of Sprint Corp. S 0.33 % \u2019s plan to improve its network and win back customers: thousands of sidewalk utility poles.\n\nThe Overland Park, Kan., company wants to install low-power cellular antennas in public rights of way, land typically holding utility poles, street lamps and fire hydrants. In places where it can\u2019t strap antennas to existing poles, it wants to erect new poles.\n\nSprint is primarily working with Mobilitie LLC, a Newport Beach, Calif., company to build these cellular antenna systems from California to Massachusetts. Mobilitie has begun installing them, which it says are typically the size of a briefcase and often inside boxes attached to the poles.\n\nBut the rollout has been delayed as communities confront what some consider unsightly installations and authorities wrestle with new regulatory questions. Sprint recently slashed its capital spending plans for the year as it waits for zoning approvals. Mobilitie says it has about 1,000 permits approved and will start large-scale installations once more are in hand.\n\nIn the past, wireless carriers built towers of 200 feet or more that could send signals over large areas to cover as many customers as possible. Now that more people use smartphones to stream videos and surf the Web, carriers want to put lower-power antennas closer to the ground so that fewer people will connect to each one\u2014resulting in less network congestion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new concept,\u201d said John Saw, Sprint\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cAll carriers are trying to \u2018densify\u2019 their networks.\u201d But Sprint\u2019s goal is to be \u201ccheaper and faster and more innovative\u201d than its rivals, he said.\n\nPopping antennas on existing utility poles is something most carriers are hoping to do. But cash-strapped Sprint aims to take the concept further than rivals: It is hoping to install as many as 70,000 antennas in the public right of way over the next few years. By comparison, it has 40,000 traditional antenna sites on towers or rooftops.\n\nIt is a central piece of a strategy devised in early 2015 by Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son to improve service while keeping costs down. Companies can negotiate with a city for one deal that includes various permits. Mobilitie Chief Executive Gary Jabara says building and operating these so-called small cells costs about $190,000 over 10 years, whereas a traditional tower costs $732,000 because of real estate rents, power and other costs.\n\nThe airwaves Sprint owns are ideally suited for this design because their high frequency prevents them from traveling long distances. Rather than string fiber-optic cables to each antenna, Sprint hopes to link them via wireless connections, further bringing down costs and speeding deployment.\n\nAnalyst Jonathan Atkin at RBC Capital Markets is skeptical, saying Sprint may only be able to build a fraction of the sites it wants in public rights-of-way governed by federal, state and local laws.\n\nMobilitie\u2019s practices in some places have faced local resistance. It has filed applications under various corporate names, including the Illinois Utility Pole Authority, NC Technology Relay Networking, and Interstate Transport and Broadband. It has used similar-sounding names in at least 30 states.\n\nJoseph Van Eaton, a lawyer who represents municipalities dealing with the applications, says the names are misleading. \u201cYou may very well end up with some of these applications being granted for exactly the reason why they like these names\u2014it sounds official,\u201d he said.\n\nMobilitie is willing to modify its applications to avoid being disruptive, Mr. Jabara says. \u201cIt\u2019s more important to be a good citizen\u201d than to move quickly, he said. \u201cYou have to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nMr. Jabara says the names also make it easier for local officials to understand the status of his firm. The company is a registered utility and those business names help reflect that status, he says. \u201cIn some states it\u2019s more comprehensible for a jurisdiction to work with an authority,\u201d he said. In the future, the company will most often use the name \u201cMobilitie\u201d in dealings with local officials, he said.\n\nIn Salem, Mass., Mobilitie applied last fall to install antennas on seven poles. After some residents expressed concerns over the look of the antennas, the company withdrew three applications and agreed to camouflage the other four.\n\nIn Baltimore, Mobilitie was fined $5,000 for failing to get proper permits for the temporary pole across from Mr. Budreski\u2019s shop, which was taken down after a few days. The company since has received approval to attach equipment to 14 poles across the city. It will pay Baltimore $70,000 for pole attachment rights in the first year of the deal. Mr. Jabara says that amount is unusually high, and many places charge less than $50 a year per pole.\n\nMr. Jabara says such incidents were inadvertent mistakes. Sprint\u2019s Mr. Saw says his company is committed to being patient and making sure municipalities are comfortable with its plans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised that sometimes you will run into opposition in certain jurisdictions,\u201d Mr. Saw says. \u201c \u2018Not in my backyard\u2019 has been around for a very long time.\u201d\n\nWrite to Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.com",

LOUIS -- The St. Louis Cardinals have signed free-agent right-hander Mike Leake to a five-year, $80 million deal, as first reported by FOX Sports Insider Ken Rosenthal on Tuesday.\n\nSource: #STLCards in agreement with Leake, pending a physical.\n\nSource: Leake deal with #STLCards is for five years with an option and includes a full no-trade clause.\n\nSource: Leake deal is five years, $80M with mutual option that could increase total value to $93M/$94M range.\n\nMinutes after his contract with the Cardinals was announced, Leake was looking ahead to rivalry games against the Chicago Cubs.\n\n\"Honestly,\" he said Tuesday, \"I wouldn't mind taking them down.\"\n\nSt. Louis hopes the addition of Leake will boosts its chances to win a fourth consecutive NL Central title.\n\nDuring his news conference, Leake raised a No. 8 jersey, the number he wore at Arizona State.\n\n\"When we make decisions, it is about performance,\" Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak said. \"We heard nothing but positives.\"\n\nLeake described the Cardinals as a \"dynasty.\" Before last season, St. Louis had been to the NL Championship Series or deeper four consecutive years.\n\n\"When the offseason is unfolding, different options pop up,\" Mozeliak said. \"When this did, we decided it made a lot of sense. I do think it makes the Cardinals stronger.\"\n\nLeake gets $12 million next year, $15 million in 2017, $17 million in 2018, $16 million in 2019 and $15 million in 2020. The deal includes an $18 million mutual option for 2021 with a $5 million buyout. Leake also receives a full no-trade provision.\n\nA 28-year-old right-hander, Leake is 64-52 with a 3.88 ERA in six big-league seasons. He was 11-10 with a 3.70 ERA for Cincinnati and San Francisco last season, totaling 30 starts and 192 innings.\n\nAce Adam Wainwright, who returned late in the season from a torn left Achilles tendon, heads a rotation that includes Carlos Martinez, who was sidelined in September by a shoulder injury but is anticipated to be ready for spring training. Jaime Garcia and Michael Wacha also are expected to start, and lefties Marco Gonzales, Tyler Lyons and Tim Cooney could earn rotation spots.\n\n\"I think we can be the best,\" Leake said. \"If they name me the No. 5 guy, that's fine with me.\"\n\nSt. Louis failed in efforts earlier this osseason to retain right fielder Jason Heyward and add left-handed ace David Price.\n\nMozeliak said talks with Leake began about a week and a half ago. Leake had put a priority on Arizona, where he lives, but the Diamondbacks signed Zack Greinke and acquired Shelby Miller from Atlanta.\n\n\"Honestly, once Arizona got out of the picture I was open to whatever team I felt fit my needs the best,\" Leake said. \"(Arizona) was my No. 1. Coming here has turned into my new No. 1.\"",

    "text": "Every month I coach dozens of young people from around the globe who have no idea what they\u2019re doing with their lives how to better plan their careers. Having found a number of common threads, I\u2019ve put together some guidance for anyone seeking to determine their life\u2019s purpose. Here are the main concepts to consider, distilled into seven key words:\n\nMost of my clients have no idea what they want. Some have a story they tell themselves about what they\u2019re doing or what they\u2019re planning to do next, but they have no idea what they REALLY want.\n\nWhat we really want can usually be identified once we stop censoring ourselves, trying to come up with an answer that sounds prestigious or glamorous or reflects what we think is economically feasible or what our family wants. I tell everyone: get all those things out of your head and then give yourself to the count of three to answer as quickly as possible \u201cWhat do I want in life?\u201d Nine times out of 10, that\u2019s your answer.\n\nUntil you know what you want, no one else can help you get there. The first step starts in ruthlessly identifying what that is\n\nIf you still can\u2019t come up with what you really want out of life, a good place to start is by examining what you\u2019re scared of. I strongly believe that fear tells us what we should be doing and the most successful people proceed directly into what scares them.\n\nLike most humans, everyone I work with is very scared of something \u2013 of many things actually. Instead of backing down in the face of those things, we tackle them head on. We look at it like, this is a lot of good stuff to put on your radar and start learning about how you roll in the fear zone.\n\nGo where you\u2019ll grow, and you\u2019ll grow most when you\u2019re really freaked out about something.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t get the ball rolling, look for opportunities to give. What do you have that you can share with the world, regardless of monetary compensation? What can you teach others? Where might just your physical presence be a gift to someone in need?\n\nMost unhappy people are living selfish lives without looking at the simplest question of all: What can I give to someone else? Today. Now. Whenever you feel lost, give, share, and love.\n\nI find that many people who feel stuck in life are failing to actively and strategically connect with others. Once I identify what someone wants, the next step is to make a list of all the people who can help him or her achieve it and then start methodically connecting with all of those people, personally asking each one for help or otherwise shamelessly putting their talents out there in front of them.\n\nAgain, most people are terrified to do this. And of course we must figure out how to do it appropriately and with a value proposition. We first need to work on our self-confidence to make it a reality. The fear of connecting with important people in a field of interest is precisely what holds us back from reaching the top.\n\nPeople tend to seriously underestimate the value of silence and stillness in their lives. They run around at 100 miles per hour every day, ingesting so much information and stimulation but never giving it time to settle in.\n\nI tell each and every person I work with to sit and be completely still for half an hour every night before bed, a sacred time to turn off all the devices, get into pajamas, prepare the mind for rest, reflect on the day, and let the mind digest how the day shifted things around in its inner chambers. The heart can\u2019t speak while the body is moving and the mind is restless, so we have to take these three steps: still the body, quiet the mind, and listen to the heart. Every day.\n\nMost people are faking it. You have to do the same. You will feel one way \u2013 and most of the time it\u2019s your animal brain screaming out in fear or laziness \u2013 but to go anywhere, you can\u2019t just do what you feel like doing. Act like the person you dream of being, and eventually you\u2019ll get there.\n\nResearchers estimate that the likelihood of YOU being born to your parents, with your set of DNA, in this particular moment in history \u2013 considering all the history of warfare and natural destruction and utter chaos \u2013 is about 1 in 400 trillion. Everything that has ever happened in the universe has brought you to this moment now. Once you wrap your head around that fact, it\u2019s hard to sit back and feel sorry for yourself or let fear stop you from delivering on what you\u2019re very clearly here for a reason to deliver to us. Your life is a miracle. So is mine. Now let\u2019s act accordingly.",

I'm now exposed and I'm screaming and thrashing.\"\n\nFortunately Barker, now 43, was able to get away.\n\n\"I kicked and I actually kicked him in the nuts and he sort of jumped back for a second.

    "text": "With the U.S. confronting an obesity epidemic that shows no signs of abating, some doctors and scientists are divided on just how dangerous extra weight is.\n\nThe debate is a critical one when you consider that about two-thirds of U.S. adults are classified as either overweight or obese, meaning they have a body-mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 25 or higher.\n\nWhile most everyone agrees weight loss is a good goal for those who are heavy, some researchers now believe that fitness is more important than fatness when it comes to long-term health and longevity.\n\nThey cite studies showing that people in the overweight category\u2014or those with a BMI from 25 to 29.9\u2014actually have better survival rates in some situations than their normal-weight counterparts, a finding known as the \u201cobesity paradox.\u201d\n\nOthers say the risks related to obesity are being underestimated. They say most of the studies supporting the obesity paradox are flawed in that they don\u2019t take into account people\u2019s weight history.\n\nCarl J. Lavie, the medical director for cardiac rehabilitation and director of exercise laboratories at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans, says overweight people can be healthy, so fitness should be the goal. Andrew Stokes, assistant professor in the department of global health and Center for Global Health and Development at Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health, disagrees, saying the risks associated with extra weight are being underestimated.\n\nFirst and foremost, I don\u2019t promote overweightness or obesity or suggest that normal-size people gain weight. That said, fat isn\u2019t always the demon it is made out to be when it comes to a person\u2019s long-term health and mortality.\n\nIn a perfect world, everyone would be lean, fit and metabolically healthy, maintaining balanced blood-sugar levels, healthy lipid profiles and good blood pressure throughout life. However, this is far from the case in the U.S., where nearly three out of four adults are classified as either overweight or obese.\n\nThe good news for those who may be struggling to lose weight and keep it off is this: As I explored in my book \u201cThe Obesity Paradox,\u201d there can be surprising benefits to carrying around a few extra pounds. In fact, being out of physical shape and having low overall fitness is actually a far greater danger to health than fat, especially in people who are only slightly overweight.\n\nA major 2013 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and led by Katherine Flegal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that although obesity was associated with much higher risk of death, it was all due to the higher mortality in moderate and severely obese people, or those with body-mass indexes (BMIs) greater than 35 and 40, respectively.\n\nThe mildly obese, or those with BMIs of 30 to 34.9, actually had a 5% lower mortality than did the normal BMI subjects, which wasn\u2019t quite statistically significant. More important, the overweight people, or those with BMIs between 25 and 29.9, had the lowest mortality and a significant 6% lower mortality than the normal BMI subjects, according to the researchers, who analyzed 97 studies involving nearly 2.9 million adults.\n\nAlthough the paper was controversial and harshly criticized by some, many obesity experts around the world applauded the results because it supported their data and observations. Furthermore, it got the conversation moving in a different direction\u2014one that must account for the quality of one\u2019s fitness and metabolism regardless of weight and fatness.\n\nMany overweight or mildly obese individuals can have normal blood glucose levels, lipid profiles and blood pressure, and if these people are physically active and have a good level of fitness, substantial evidence indicates that they can be extremely healthy\u2014more so than lean individuals who are unfit or metabolically unhealthy. So while preventing more severe obesity is indeed a necessary goal, the vital takeaway from the latest scientific literature is: Fitness is more important than fatness for long-term health.\n\nI have emphasized in many of my medical papers that being heavier increases the risk of coronary heart disease, as well as other cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. However, as numerous reports show, the overweight and even the mildly obese have a better short- and medium-term prognosis and survival compared with normal BMI subjects with these same diseases, a phenomenon called the obesity paradox and possibly better termed an overweight paradox.\n\nWhen people gain weight, the majority of weight is in fat pounds, but some muscle weight increases, as well, more so if one is exercising. By contrast, a thin person who is physically inactive and physically weak, with poor fitness and low muscle mass and muscular strength, is actually \u201csicker\u201d than the heavier person who is fitter. And very thin people (BMI in the upper teens and low 20s and especially less than 18.5, which is considered \u201cunderweight\u201d), generally have the worst prognosis and survival for many conditions, partly because they have fewer fat reserves to fall back on when major illness takes a toll on their bodies.\n\nSome critics of the obesity paradox take issue with the fact that many obesity studies don\u2019t differentiate between people who have always been normal weight and people who used to be overweight or obese but lost weight (which could be bad if their weight loss was due to illness). They also suggest that the beverage industry may have influenced results by funding some research. The truth is, the studies supporting the obesity paradox are large, clean and robust and have been published in prestigious journals, something over which the beverage industry has no control.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that preventing obesity at the extreme end is important. But the situation for those who are overweight or mildly obese isn\u2019t \u201cdoomsday,\u201d as they can be very healthy despite the extra pounds. For these people, which represent a large number of adults in the U.S., weight loss is a good goal, but preventing weight gain and maintaining optimal fitness is a more important goal.\n\nDr. Lavie is the medical director for cardiac rehabilitation and director of exercise laboratories at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans. Email him at reports@wsj.com.\n\nIt is almost hard to imagine that in the early 1960s, at the peak of the smoking epidemic, about half of American men and a third of American women smoked cigarettes. Although lung-cancer rates started climbing as early as the 1920s and studies showing a link to smoking began to appear soon thereafter, appreciation of the harms of smoking remained remarkably low for many decades.\n\nNot until the landmark Surgeon General\u2019s report of 1964 declared that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer did public perception start turning. To fight faltering sales, the tobacco industry launched an aggressive campaign to sow doubt about the harms of smoking that would last for many years. This campaign, which enlisted respected physicians and researchers, sought to portray the science on the health effects of smoking as unresolved.\n\nWe find ourselves in a similar situation today even if the culprits may not be as obvious as before. The proportion of the U.S. population that is overweight (defined as having a body-mass index of 25 to 29.9) or obese (BMI of 30 or greater) has increased rapidly in recent decades, and excess weight is a well-established risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Yet, as was the case historically with smoking, the effects of carrying extra weight on the risk of dying apparently remain an open controversy.\n\nSome research in recent years has suggested that being in the overweight range may actually lower a person\u2019s risk of dying prematurely. Some in the food and drink industry have embraced the finding, funding researchers whose work supports the idea that extra weight may be good for you. Other skeptics, both inside and outside of academia, have jumped on board, claiming that the hazards associated with excess weight are overblown.\n\nWhy does it remain unclear after so much research whether being overweight is helpful or harmful for longevity? There is one simple but surprisingly overlooked problem with previous studies examining the effects of being overweight and obese: They fail to account for weight history.\n\nLooking at weight at a single point in time, like almost all obesity studies do, misses the fact that low weight can be a sign that something is wrong\u2014that is, sometimes people are slim because they have a serious illness such as heart disease or cancer. To epidemiologists, this bias is known as confounding by illness or reverse causality.\n\nUsing information on weight history, it is possible to address this seemingly intractable source of bias. Weight history makes it possible to distinguish people who were slim throughout their lives from those who were formerly overweight or obese but lost weight. Again, the importance of this distinction can be seen in a simple analogy to smoking.\n\nIf you study the health effects of smoking by comparing smokers to nonsmokers, you may very well conclude that smoking isn't all that bad for you. However, the reason isn\u2019t that smoking is inconsequential but that the comparison is biased. Nonsmokers include both low-risk people who never smoked and high-risk people who used to smoke but quit\u2014many of them after developing an illness. To deal with this bias, epidemiologists factor in smoking history to divide current nonsmokers into former smokers and never smokers.\n\nIn similar fashion, any study that fails to distinguish never-overweight/obese people from the former overweight/obese will arrive at biased results. This doesn\u2019t mean that all people who maintained normal weight throughout their lives are healthy. Likewise, not all people who were formerly overweight/obese and lost weight are at high risk of dying. Some of them lost weight through healthy lifestyle change, and there is strong evidence that this form of weight loss reduces risk of cardiovascular disease, though science has shown that intentional weight loss is difficult to achieve and even more difficult to sustain.\n\nBut my research with Samuel Preston of the University of Pennsylvania suggests that taken as a whole, people who were formerly overweight/obese and are now of normal weight are a high-risk group because of illness-induced weight loss. Conflating this group with the never-overweight/obese category\u2014as almost all prior studies do\u2014obscures the real health risks associated with excess weight.\n\nFlawed research has helped to create an appearance of much greater uncertainty than actually exists around the science on overweight and obesity. With about two-thirds of Americans currently classified as overweight or obese, it is vital that we don\u2019t become complacent and that we do everything in our capacity, at individual, community and national levels, to aggressively tackle this epidemic in the U.S.\n\nDr. Stokes is an assistant professor in the department of global health and Center for Global Health and Development at Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health.

    "text": "On Sunday night, the streets of Ferguson descended into violent chaos, prompting the governor to deploy the Missouri national guard. Governor Jay Nixon, who acts as commander-in-chief of his state\u2019s national guard, said the troops are needed to restore peace and order in the northern St Louis suburb.\n\nEach state, Washington DC and US territories have a national guard, and serve a dual state and federal mission.\n\nIt is first and foremost a state agency, but units can be mobilised by the US president to assist the country\u2019s armed forces. States\u2019 national guard units often receive federal funding and training.\n\nAll states have an air national guard and an army national guard. The forces are organised by units that can include military, medical, aviation and engineering, among others. The governor serves as commander-in-chief.\n\nIn general, guard soldiers hold civilian jobs and live at home. They have a drill commitment one weekend per month and are required to attend one two-week training each year.\n\nThe governor is not required to notify the US president of the administration before calling the national guard into service.\n\nUnder state law, the national guard may be activated by governors \u2013 as Nixon has done in Missouri \u2013 to respond to domestic emergencies such as natural disasters and civil disturbances.\n\nNational guard forces are most often called in to assist with natural disasters as Missouri did after a catastrophic tornado ripped through the city of Joplin in 2011.\n\nJim Craig, an associate professor of military and veteran studies at the University of Missouri-St Louis, said deploying the state national guard to quell civil unrest is less common.\n\n\u201cCalling out the national guard for a flood is one thing, calling out the national guard for riots and unrest moves way into the extreme,\u201d Craig said.\n\nTexas governor Rick Perry has sent roughly 1,000 army national guard troops to the US-Mexico border where thousands of unaccompanied Central American children are entering the country. The troops will aid the state\u2019s department of public safety with a border-security mission.\n\nNational guard personnel can be ordered to active duty by the federal government to serve in overseas missions. They can be called to duty voluntarily or ordered under other specific circumstances.\n\nFor example, Craig said some Missouri national guard engineers are currently serving in Afghanistan.\n\nThe key differences between national guard troops being ordered to active duty by the state, and their deployment by the federal government, are who foots the bill and who\u2019s in control.\n\nWhen units are called up to serve in overseas combat missions, for example, the personnel are federally funded and under federal command and control.\n\nIn other situations, national guard personnel can be federally funded to perform certain duties but remain under state control. This happened during hurricane Katrina as well as during Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration.\n\nWhen a state deploys the national guard, the state pays and the soldiers report to the governor.\n\nThe national guard has been deployed to maintain control during some key racially fuelled events in US history.\n\nIn 1957 and 1958, the Arkansas governor ordered the state national guard to prevent black enrollments at a public high school.\n\nIn 1965, President Lyndon B Johnson federalized the Alabama national guard after images of state troopers beating peaceful civil rights protestors marching from Selma to Montgomery sparked outrage.\n\nIn 1968, they were deployed during the riots that lit up across the country in wake of the assassination of the civil rights leader, Martin Luther King.\n\nIn 1992 California national guard forces were called in to regain control of Los Angeles after riots erupted when four white officers were acquitted of severely beating a black man, Rodney King. President George HW Bush then declared it a federal disaster area and called the guard into federal service. More than 50 people died and nearly 2,000 people were injured before the troops eventually quelled the situation.\n\nCraig questioned whether the presence of the national guard would be effective in Ferguson. \u201cThe National Guard by design is militarised, and so that doesn\u2019t theoretically de-escalate the situation. It actually may change the dynamic.\u201d",

    "text": "Wachovia Bank settled after it was accused of laundering $378 billion in Mexican drug cartel funds between 2004 and 2007.\n\nEditor's note: Heather A. Lowe is legal counsel and director of government affairs at Global Financial Integrity, a research and advocacy organization in Washington.\n\n(CNN) -- The United States has a strong national interest in economic, political and civil stability in Mexico. Its war against transnational drug cartels has dramatically highlighted Mexico's problems, but the truth is that the nation has had deep, unsolved, structural problems in its economy and an opaque international financial system for decades.\n\nGlobal Financial Integrity's report on Mexico found that $872 billion in illicit finances left the country from 1970 through 2010. Although some laundered drug money may be included in that figure, it overwhelmingly represents tax evasion by both domestic and multinational corporations doing business in Mexico, as well as corruption, kickbacks and bribery from wealthy Mexican public officials and business leaders.\n\nEvidence in the report suggests that much of this illicit money ends up in the United States. Illicit flows, through a phenomenon known as trade mispricing, dramatically increased after the North American Free Trade Agreement was established, and have remained high. Bank deposit data from the Bank of International Settlements show that the United States is the No. 1 destination for Mexican funds. The study reveals that increases in the flow of illicit funds significantly drive Mexico's underground economy, which includes drug smuggling and human trafficking. As a result, Mexico's underground economy has ballooned to more than 30% of its GDP.\n\nBut the United States has the power to help Mexico at little cost to itself. Mexico's tax authorities need easy, automatic, access to bank deposit information on Mexican citizens with accounts in the United States, so that they may track tax evasion and other financial crimes across the border.\n\nUnder an existing treaty, the U.S. government is required to make information about specific Mexican account holders available to Mexico upon request. But the United States does not collect enough information from U.S. banks to meet most requests and must go to the banks and collect it. In practice, that system is too slow and burdensome to generate the volume of information needed to enable the Mexican government to analyze the flow of funds across the border. An automatic system of exchange would allow Mexican authorities to clamp down on illicit funds leaving their country.\n\nThe U.S. and Canada employ such a system. The U.S. Treasury already collects the requisite information on Canadian citizens' accounts in the United States and sends it to Canada automatically, and vice versa. The Canadians have the same form of automatic tax information exchange with Mexico. This means that the only exchange relationship missing between NAFTA countries is between the United States and Mexico.\n\nThe technology is already in place to execute automatic exchange, and all that is needed on the U.S. side is that the government collect a Form 1099 for all Mexican citizens with accounts in the United States. It should be very easy for Treasury to quickly and cheaply expand automatic exchange of tax information to our southern neighbor.\n\nMexico has asked for this information. In 2009, then-Mexican Finance Secrecy Agustin Carstens formally requested that the United States automatically exchange tax information with Mexico, in order to \"help detect and prevent tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing, drug trafficking and organized crime.\" As far as we know, the Treasury has not replied.\n\nMoney is the lifeblood of any criminal organization. Tracking money has proven to be an effective way for law enforcement to catch criminals over countless generations. Al Capone himself was only caught by Eliot Ness through charges of tax evasion. Mexico needs those same tools in its arsenal to combat organized crime. Without U.S. cooperation, this becomes much more difficult.\n\nIf the United States truly wants Mexico to successfully combat the corruption, violence and pervasive influence of organized crime inside its borders, it should help Mexico address the root structural causes of its turmoil. There is no good reason to withhold this information from our neighbors. By virtue of our geographic proximity, Mexico's problems become the United States' problems. There is no excuse to ignore a highly effective, low-cost option available to us in this fight.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Heather Lowe.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Pentagon's top lawyer on Thursday informed the former Navy SEAL who wrote a forthcoming book describing details of the raid that killed Usama bin Laden that he violated agreements to not divulge military secrets and that as a result the Pentagon is considering taking legal action against him.\n\nThe general counsel of the Defense Department, Jeh Johnson, wrote in a letter transmitted to the author that he had signed two nondisclosure agreements with the Navy in 2007 that obliged him to \"never divulge\" classified information.\n\n\"This commitment remains in force even after you left the active duty Navy,\" Johnson wrote. He said the author, Matt Bissonnette, left active duty \"on or about April 20, 2012,\" which was nearly one year after the May 2011 raid.\n\nBy signing the agreements, Bissonnette acknowledged his awareness, Johnson wrote, that \"disclosure of classified information constitutes a violation of federal criminal law.\" He said it also obliged the author to submit his manuscript for a security review by the government before it was published. The Pentagon has said the manuscript was not submitted for review, although it obtained a copy last week.\n\nJohnson said that after reviewing a copy of the book, \"No Easy Day,\" the Pentagon concluded that the author is in \"material breach and violation\" of the agreements.\n\nThe book is to be published next week by Penguin Group (USA)'s Dutton imprint. The Associated Press purchased a copy Tuesday.\n\nJohnson addressed his letter to Mr. \"Mark Owen,\" using quotation marks to signify that that this is the author's pseudonym. His real name is Matt Bissonnette.\n\nBissonnette referred requests for comment about the letter to his publisher, which was not immediately available.\n\n\"I write to formally advise you of your material breach and violation of your agreements, and to inform you that the department is considering pursuing against you, and all those acting in concert with you, all remedies legally available to us in light of this situation,\" Johnson wrote.\n\nThe Pentagon has not revealed how it got a copy of the book.\n\nJohnson noted that \"copies of the book have apparently already been released.\" He added, \"further public dissemination of your book will aggravate your breach and violation of your agreements.\"\n\nThe Pentagon did not release copies of the nondisclosure agreements that it said Bissonnette had signed in 2007. A spokesman, Army Col. Steve Warren, said they were being withheld because they include the author's real name and his signature.\n\nIn his book, Bissonnette wrote that the SEALs spotted bin Laden at the top of a darkened hallway and shot him in the head even though they could not tell whether he was armed. Administration officials have described the SEALs shooting bin Laden only after he ducked back into a bedroom because they assumed he might be reaching for a weapon.\n\nMilitary experts said Wednesday that if Bissonnette's recollection is accurate, the SEALS made the right call to open fire on the terrorist mastermind, who had plenty of time to reach for a weapon or explosives as they made their way up to the third level of the house where he hid.",

Pataki waived the state's sales tax on clothing purchases under $500 during weeks in January and September.\n\nThe one-week reprieves generated a combined $350 million in additional retail sales, state officials have estimated, a pace that New Yorkers including Mayor Giuliani seemed eager to match yesterday.\n\nThe mayor shelled out $44.99 at the Caldor store at Bruckner Blvd. and White Plains Road in the Bronx, but then told reporters, \"I am not going to tell you what I bought, because it is a little embarrassing.\"\n\nAn aide later confided that it was socks and underwear.\n\nThe mayor, who believes the state should make every week sales-tax free, then went around the corner to Old Navy, where he said that abolishing the state's sales tax could generate 20,000 new retail jobs in New York City alone.\n\n\"This is the best jobs program you could possibly do,\" he said.\n\nThe mayor then forked over another $58.97 for three pairs of Old Navy socks, two sweatshirts and a red sweater, bringing his total tally for the day to $103.96. With the sales-tax reprieve, he saved $8.58.\n\nCity economists have long noted that New York loses millions of dollars in clothing sales every year to neighboring states.\n\nFour of New York's neighbors Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts have no sales tax on clothing.\n\nNew York's current giveaway covers almost all clothing and, for the first time this year, almost all shoes. But there are exceptions, and some of them can get fairly complicated.\n\nShoppers won't be charged the additional tax on hiking boots, for example, but \"climbing boots\" are not exempt, according to state officials.\n\nOther specialized footwear, such as ballet slippers and cleats, also are not exempt from the tax.\n\nSome of the items that are tax-free, however, include jogging suits, bathrobes, dress gloves (but not baseball gloves), suits, ties, dresses, boat shoes (but not fishing boots), belts, hats and jeans.\n\nDespite publicity surrounding this week's reprieve including $400,000 in taxpayer-funded radio ads that tout Mayor Giuliani's support for the measure many shoppers said the giveback came as a pleasant surprise yesterday.\n\n\"I didn't know it was tax-free until I looked at the sign [by the cash register],\" Brooklyn resident Alex Khamish, 19, said of the shirt he bought yesterday at Manhattan Mall in Herald Square. \"It's very good.\"",

    "text": "Protestors rallied against the health care law\u2019s contraception mandate in Philadelphia last year. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nMore than half the nation\u2019s attorneys general want the Supreme Court to revisit the Affordable Care Act in the coming months.\n\nAttorneys general in 29 states urged the court in filings this week to review lower-court decisions on the landmark health care law\u2019s contraception mandate, but they were split over which of two cases the court should focus on. Both involve employers who say the law\u2019s contraception mandate violates their freedom of religion.\n\nEleven attorneys general, along with the White House, want the court to review a lower-court opinion that found that the contraception mandate violates a business\u2019s freedom of religion. Eighteen other state attorneys general want the court to review another opinion, which found the opposite. Dozens of lawsuits on that mandate have been filed by nonprofits and corporations nationwide.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t necessarily an easy question with an easy answer,\u201d says South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley, who joined the 17 attorneys general seeking a review of the ruling that upheld the law\u2019s contraception mandate. \u201cIn other words, each side can cite supporting authority for their positions, which is why in and of itself it\u2019s important for the Supreme Court to solve this.\u201d\n\nThose 18 states, led by Ohio and Michigan, want the court to review a Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that upheld the mandate, which covers contraception that includes the morning-after pill. In that case, the Mennonite Hahn family of Pennsylvania, owners of the kitchen cabinet part manufacturer Conestoga Wood Specialties, sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, arguing that the law\u2019s mandate violated their religious beliefs.\n\nBut the case has implications beyond just the mandate, Jackley says.\n\n\u201cAt least from my perspective, it\u2019s bigger than that,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is can a federal mandate force upon an individual or businesses something that is contrary to their religious beliefs? And I believe that is something that the First Amendment protects against.\u201d\n\nAnother case \u2014 in which the court found the mandate did violate a firm\u2019s religious expression\u2014may also have far-reaching implications, California Attorney General Kamala Harris argued in the separate filing with 10 other state attorneys general.\n\nIn that case, the Green family, which owns the nationwide Hobby Lobby arts and crafts chain of stores, sued the government just as the Hahn family had. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the family in June, arguing that the contraception requirement violates the religious rights of the Christian family and its businesses.\n\nCalifornia and the other states see a few big problems with that decision: It grants broad powers to corporations, restricts employee rights and limits states\u2019 power to protect public health and gender equity in health care access. There are also other complications, such as how to determine a corporation\u2019s religious views.\n\n\u201c[H]ow should a court determine the religion of a corporation where a minority of owners or shareholders does not share the religious views of the majority? Or where shareholders disagree on the obligations imposed by their commonly-held religion?\u201d the states ask in their filing.\n\nIf that ruling is upheld, the attorneys general argue, businesses could claim religious exemptions to all sorts of state and federal regulations in the areas of public safety, civil rights, social welfare, land use, housing, employment and public health.\n\nHarris was joined by the attorneys general from Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.\n\nJackley was joined by his counterparts in Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.",

And do we see an experienced leader or sell-out in Hillary Clinton?\n\nIn a widely praised final State of the Union address, President Obama discussed his primary regret as being that he was unable to fix the partisanship that has been plaguing Washington. This theme was echoed in Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley\u2019s rebuttal. It\u2019s clear that both sides see partisanship as a serious issue that is holding our nation back.\n\nAnd this is ultimately the reason why a political revolution won\u2019t save us \u2013 from the left or the right. The system just isn\u2019t built that way.\n\nNo one challenges Bernie Sanders\u2019s authenticity, but there is a very real challenge in getting a candidate elected whose vision is so extreme.\n\nSingle payer health care \u2013 a policy that Hillary Clinton has long championed herself \u2013 could not even get passed with a Democratically-controlled House and Senate and a strong Democrat in the White House. The unabashed demonization of the financial services and pharmaceutical industries alienates key drivers of the American economy. Tuition free college sounds amazing \u2013 especially as someone who spent way too long in graduate school \u2013 but even with a plan to pay for it through raising taxes, it\u2019s a fantasy.\n\nBernie\u2019s vision is compelling. On Sunday night he showed his usual passion and ability to evolve: he has modified his position and now thinks that gun manufacturers can be held responsible in certain cases and he clearly takes the threat of ISIS seriously, something that has been questioned in the past.\n\nBut a compelling vision doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into success in governing a divided populace.\n\nThis is where Hillary\u2019s strength lies.\n\nShe offers the feasible version of Bernie\u2019s political revolution. We should build on the Affordable Care Act, not replace it. We should be dedicated to making higher education more affordable and accessible, but not promising schemes that will never be turned into law. And she leads her Iran policy with the maxim \u201cdistrust but verify,\u201d an embodiment of her muscular approach to foreign policy.\n\nI return to the ACA to most clearly show why Hillary is the one who understands the liberal agenda and how to get things done. On stage in Charleston Sunday night, she recognized that we accomplished a historic milestone for social progress and the imprudence of scrapping it with a hostile congress and a country that is fatigued of the issue. The answer to this isn\u2019t \u201csingle payer or bust.\u201d To Bernie that doesn\u2019t seem to matter. And that\u2019s where Bernie\u2019s political revolution fails us.\n\nPragmatism doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t boldness and a big heart in her own vision. When she spoke of a lifetime of public service fighting for women\u2019s equality, children and a better life for the middle class she means it. And her record shows that.\n\nSo the answer to the question of whether Hillary is a pragmatist or a sell out is that she\u2019s a woman who understands that the prospects for improving the lives of everyday Americans hinges on the ability to champion solutions that those on the right will at least consider.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Bernie Sanders\u2019s vision for America. But that isn\u2019t the issue. The issue is who can we nominate that can win an election and govern in a way that makes progress certain, albeit slow. #ImWithHer.\n\nJessica Tarlov, Ph.D., is a political strategist at Douglas E.

    "text": "A THREE-BEDROOM TRADITIONAL-STYLE HOME IN UBUD\n\nThis house, consisting of two refurbished traditional Javanese structures known as joglos, is in Ubud, the inland city of temples and jungle-covered hills on Bali. Ubud is where the author Elizabeth Gilbert found love in her 2006 book \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d which helped raise international interest in property there.\n\nJoglos are simple, open-air, wood-beam buildings found on the island of Java, hundreds of which have been dismantled and rebuilt as villas on Bali. The wood for this house is more than 120 years old and was originally used for a train station on Java, according to Jared Collins, a marketing consultant with Ubud Homes, which is listing the property.\n\nThe two joglos were rebuilt into this 3,300-square-foot home in 2010. Like most joglos, they are constructed around four wood pillars that form a tall central core, which draws hot air from the small rooms radiating from the center.\n\nThe house, with three bedrooms and four bathrooms, is on 0.22 acres about five and a half miles from the center of town and about 800 feet off a road filled with buzzing motorbikes and small trucks. The land is surrounded by a palm tree plantation and fields of alang-alang, the tall grass used to make thatched roofs.\n\nThe property is entered through a teak door, which leads to a wide pathway. The buildings are surrounded by gardens with traditional Indonesian figurines, and there is a large barbecue pedestal near a rectangular swimming pool, which separates the two joglos.\n\nThe main building features a large open living area, a dining area with a table for eight, two bedrooms and a Western-style kitchen with modern appliances. The floors are teak; the hardwood furniture is included in the price. Each bedroom has its own bathroom with a stone bathtub and separate shower. and a stone sink. There is air-conditioning in the bedrooms, but the living areas have only fans, which is common for modern villas on Bali.\n\nThe second building serves as the master bedroom suite, with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the pool. The king-size bed is on a platform in the center, surrounded by a sitting area, an office, a walk-in closet and a bathroom.\n\nA third structure on the property can serve as staff quarters, including a kitchen and laundry room. The property also has a license to operate as a bed-and-breakfast, Mr. Collins says.\n\nLuxury home prices on Bali rose by 15 percent in 2014, making it the third-fastest growing upscale second-home market in the world, behind New York and Aspen, Colo., and tied with Istanbul, according to data tracked by the real estate firm Knight Frank. International interest is driving the market, spurred by the relatively low prices and widespread media attention, including exposure from the book \u201cEat, Pray, Love\u201d and the 2010 movie version, property agents say.\n\nIn Ubud, foreigners account for as much as 50 percent of transactions, said Terje H. Nilsen, a principal in the Ray White Paradise Property Group, a Bali-based real estate company. \u201cIt\u2019s really taking off,\u201d he said.\n\nWith no multiple listing service and little shared sales data, it is difficult to track real values, agents say. Prices for choice parcels near the center of Ubud have increased from 300 percent to 400 percent in five years, with some properties fetching as much as $1,500 a square meter, or about $140 a square foot, Mr. Collins said.\n\n\u201cThe market is without a doubt overheated,\u201d he said. \u201cPrices are changing every three months.\u201d Despite a construction boom, there is still a limited supply of homes that meet the standards of Western buyers, agents say.\n\nJoglos have been particularly popular with international buyers. \u201cThey are still comparatively cheap to acquire and build out, as opposed to permanent concrete structures,\u201d Mr. Collins said.\n\nBut prices for joglos have skyrocketed in recent years, and the Java government has also moved to limit the export of the structures.\n\n\u201cPrices are high, because many have already been bought and brought to Bali,\u201d said Alejandra Cisneros, a designer based in Bali who has helped restore joglos. \u201cAnd the Javanese are now not as willing to part with those joglos that are left.\u201d\n\nFar removed from the Bali beach-party scene, Ubud is famous as a haven for hippies, spiritualists and healers, who flock to the city seeking a healthy lifestyle as well as enlightenment. The streets are lined with meditation centers, yoga centers and organic restaurants.\n\nBuyers typically range from bargain-hunting backpackers to the very wealthy, who seek the large villas that dot the hills and valleys around the city, Mr. Nilsen said. Australians are among the most active buyers, but Chinese and Korean buyers are becoming increasingly common, he said, and Indonesians have also become more active in recent years.\n\nTraditionally, international buyers have bought homes in Ubud to start a new life on the island or as a second home. But in recent years, many of the foreign buyers have been focused on properties that can be used as short-term rentals for tourists.\n\n\u201cI probably meet a new person every other day who tells me he or she is moving to Bali and would like to build a little something with perhaps a rental property attached,\u201d Ms. Cisneros said.\n\nForeigners cannot directly own freehold land on Bali. For many years, international buyers commonly purchased land through \u201cnominees,\u201d putting the title in the name of an Indonesian citizen or company. But recent comments by a government official signaled a move to crack down on the nominee deals, which have never been endorsed by law.\n\nNominee deals \u201care not allowed,\u201d said Devy Susanti, who works as a private Bali land deal officer, assisting buyers and sellers. She strongly urges international buyers to avoid the nominee process.\n\nBut there are alternatives. Property experts advise foreigners to use one of two systems for buying control of a property. Through one process, the land is transferred to government control and the buyer is given what is known as Hak Pakai, the right to use the property for up to 70 years. Another method is to arrange a long-term lease directly with the owner of the property.\n\n\u201cLong-term leasing is the best and safest way for foreigners to invest here in Bali at this time,\u201d Mr. Collins said.\n\nWhatever the course, experts warn the process can be complex, with many potential hazards. A lawyer and notary can research the land certificate and other official documentation for the property.\n\n\u201cThe land certificate is key,\u201d Ms. Susanti said.\n\nIt is also essential to research the ownership of the property, amid the complicated lineage of Balinese families. \u201cYou need to make sure you are dealing with the right owner,\u201d Ms. Susanti said. \u201cSometimes you are dealing with a member of the family who doesn\u2019t have the right to lease it.\u201d\n\nIndonesian and Balinese, but English is common; Indonesian Rupiah (Rp) (1 Rupiah = $0.000077)\n\nIndonesia typically charges a 10 percent tax on freehold land transactions, based on the value of the land, which is usually split between the buyer and the seller. A foreigner acquiring this property through a long-term lease would likely pay a 5 percent buyer\u2019s tax and a 1 percent notary fee, Mr. Collins said.\n\nJared Collins, Ubud Homes, (011) 62 812 366 41107; ubudhomes.com/p-property",

    "text": "The passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (Enda) in the US Senate yesterday, with the votes of 10 Republican senators, is not the decisive victory civil rights activists might hope for \u2013 the bill still faces a hard slog through the House. More practically, as Senator Elizabeth Warren (Democrat from Massachusetts) pointed out in a typically emphatic floor speech, this single political success does nothing for the thousands of homosexual and transgendered Americans who face employment discrimination today (surveys show that between 15% and 43% of the LGBT community experience some form).\n\nBut especially considering the voting records and public statements of those 10 GOP senators \u2013 most of them had explicitly opposed Enda at some point \u2013 it's impossible not to see the Enda vote as a watershed moment. Taken with Tuesday's election results, it points to another near-abandoned front of the once-lively culture war. Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, a surprise last-minute supporter of the bill, made news last spring when he admitted that it was probably \"inevitable\" that a GOP candidate will support same-sex marriage. And, he generously allowed, \"I think he'll receive Republican support.\"\n\nAt the time \u2013 just six months ago \u2013 that seemed like an acknowledgment that the GOP base would grudgingly accept an outlier (\"I think he'll receive Republican support\"). The political atmosphere has begun to turn inside out; very soon, it will not be question of whether a GOP candidate could be a serious presidential contender and still support marriage equality, but whether a GOP candidate can be a serious presidential contender and not support marriage equality.\n\nI take Senator Warren's reminder about the lived realities of LGBT individuals very seriously. Many thousands of them do not live with the openness and freedom that straight people take for granted. What's more, convincing Republican politicians to ban employment discrimination has proven to be something of an easier sell than marriage equality. Of the \"Enda 10\", only Mark Kirk, Rob Portman and Lisa Murkowski have taken a stand on the side of human decency. But advocating against the basic rights of LGBT Americans is becoming a political liability and not a strength. And, actually, Enda yes voter John McCain (who, along with yes vote Orrin Hatch, voted against the law in 1996) recently became a vocal proponent for LGBT rights internationally. In his strident op-ed response to Vladimir Putin, he criticized the Russian leader and his allies for \"writ[ing] laws to codify bigotry against people whose sexual orientation they condemn\".\n\nSome of the movement toward gay rights on the right is admittedly of the \"less bad\" variety. Chris Christie's victory in New Jersey came even as some conservatives howled over his decision to drop a court contest over a judge's decision to allow same-sex marriage. A poll just this week in South Carolina showed that opposition to government recognition of same-sex marriage has dropped 26pt since the state passed a law against such unions in 2006 and 17pt since 2011. The law passed with 78% of the vote in 2006; in 2011 69% continued to agree with the position. Today, a bare majority, just 52%, agree \u2026 and, again, this is South Carolina, a state that Mitt Romney won by 10pts.\n\nPollsters have found that support for gay marriage trends alongside the number of respondents who say they know a gay person. Support for gay rights among politicians has contained some parallel growth, most dramatically with Rob Portman's decision to support marriage equality after his son came out as gay. (Murkowski also cited personal interactions with gay couples as a reason for her evolution on the issue.) Such one-to-one experiences are how social norms change at a fundamental level, but that kind of change takes time. If it were the only thing driving the GOP's shift, I'd be less optimistic than I am; the reason I think the timeline is far more accelerated than even movement in polls suggest is less about personal evolution than personal greed: politicians will adapt positions to conform to what donors want and more and more donors want conservatives candidates to endorse civil rights for gay people.\n\n2012 saw the beginning of this. Last month, Republican \"mega donor\" Paul Singer poured millions into an advocacy group that's actually the second he's seeded to push the GOP toward the middle (over the last decade he's given $17m to the cause). Singer himself, whose son is gay, sees opposition to LGBT discrimination as a step toward full equality, including recognition of same-sex marriage. He also sees this position as fundamentally conservative, and, ironically, the language he uses in support of gay rights echoes that of unreconstructed culture warrior Ted Cruz's against the Affordable Care Act. He warns that a crack down on gay rights would come if \"America engages in a terrible, terrible retreat from freedom, towards fascism, communism, whatever,\" Singer has said, \"some totalitarian harsh state\".\n\nOpposition to ACA is actually an instructive point for Republicans resisting the momentum of gay rights. In Virginia, Ken Cuccinelli suffered for his association with backwards attitudes toward reproductive rights and personal privacy. That he appears to have profited from his early and vocal zeal to repeal Obamacare \u2013 or, at the very least, that this was less of a disastrous position for him than his anti-gay views \u2013 has rallied the right on that issue. Perhaps just as important, conservatives seem tickled that the tide of popular culture finally seems to be channeled into their side.\n\nPersonally, I believe the ACA will wind up working, and that history will validate it as an improvement over the tragic state of healthcare coverage prior to its passage. But as someone who believes in the value of a robust two-party system, I hope that the positive feedback loop that's heartened conservatives means a return to economic conservatism as its defining principle. I mean, I still think a lot of those conservative policies won't work, but to leave behind the ugliness and personal indignities of legislated inequality would mean immeasurable progress.\n\nWe're one of the few stable democracies in the world where the dominant conservative cohort rejects social moderates out of hand. Put another way, what do you call a fiscal conservative who wants to dismantle government involvement in national healthcare but who stays out of the gay marriage debate, the pro-life debate and rejects attempts to relax gun laws? The Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nCanadian politics, at the moment, doesn't seem like the place to be picking role models. But one can hope for a future in which the response to an anti-equality Republican running for president elicits the response a Canadian might have: \"What, are you on crack?\"",

    "text": "Consumers who use the clinics are often \u201cexactly the customers that hospitals want \u2014 women of child-bearing age,\u201d said Margaret Laws, a policy expert at the California Health Care Foundation. \u201cThe hospitals want to deliver babies,\u201d she said.\n\nThe idea of retail clinics took root about four years ago, and more than 1,000 are now operating around the country in drugstores, supermarkets and big-box discounters. But in the early going, few were linked to hospitals or medical centers. Now, though, about 1 in 10 has a hospital connection, according to Merchant Medicine News, an online newsletter for the clinic industry. And many more are planned.\n\nWal-Mart, for instance, which opened its 26th hospital-connected clinic last week in Republic, Mo., in the Ozarks, says it will add dozens more in the coming months. Its hospital partners include the Christus Medical Group, in Texas; the Aurora Health System, in Wisconsin, and CoxHealth in Missouri.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic, the largest private employer in Minnesota, says it opened its clinics after hearing employees and patients say they wanted more convenient treatment for minor medical problems.\n\n\u201cWe think of ourselves as a new model of care; we meet our patients at least halfway,\u201d said Dr. David Herman, a Mayo executive who supervises the two retail clinics \u2014 along with six Mayo primary-care doctors\u2019 offices that are now open late and on weekends.\n\nHe said hospital and health care systems like Mayo should consider demand for walk-in clinics a sign that \u201cmaybe our primary-care practices in general are not as convenient and transparent as our patients want them to be.\u201d\n\nTypically staffed by physician assistants or nurse practitioners, often supervised remotely by doctors, the hospital retail clinics can operate at relatively low cost compared with primary-care doctors\u2019 offices or emergency rooms. The lower fees make them especially attractive right now, as an estimated 45 million to 50 million people in this country lack insurance, and the ranks of the unemployed are growing by the month.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by Harris Interactive, 11 percent of adults said they or someone in their immediate family had used a store clinic in the last 10 months, up from 7 percent a year earlier.\n\n\u201cThe economics in the health system are broken,\u201d said Dr. Brian Nester, a senior vice president at the Lehigh Valley Health Network, part of a three-hospital system in Allentown, Pa., and nearby Bethlehem. \u201cWe need to find out how clinics with nurse practitioners and physicians assistants will fit in.\u201d\n\nLehigh Valley Health, in a collaboration with a big regional medical provider, Geisinger Clinic, operates retail clinics in two supermarkets.\n\nOne recent afternoon, Melissa Marrero, 33, a social worker, and her husband Magdiel, 32, a security guard, walked in without an appointment to the King\u2019s Market clinic in an Allentown mall. The Marreros, who are uninsured, needed physicals for their application to become foster parents. The clinic charges $30 for a physical.\n\n\u201cIt was great \u2014 fast service and real convenient,\u201d Ms. Marrero said afterward.\n\nJanelle Sharma, the nurse practitioner in charge, said that more than one-third of the clinic\u2019s patients were uninsured.\n\nFor several years the doctors affiliated with Lehigh Valley Health opposed the hospital\u2019s plan to start a supermarket clinic. The physicians relented after the Geisinger version showed up on their turf and Lehigh Valley Health promised that patients treated in stores would be urged to follow up with a local doctor.\n\nDr. Will Miller, the chairman of family medicine doctors with practicing privileges at Lehigh Valley Health\u2019s hospital in Allentown, said he still opposed the clinics. They work against the ideal of a primary-care doctor\u2019s office that gets to know a patient\u2019s medical needs and condition over time and coordinates his or her care, he said.\n\nDr. John VanBrakle, the hospital\u2019s chairman of pediatrics, noted that the American Academy of Pediatrics, a professional organization, opposed the clinics for the same reason.\n\nIn some ways, the resistance of primary-care doctors might be more about principle than practice. As policy makers in Washington bemoan the shortage of such physicians, it may be difficult for doctors in many parts of the country to persuasively argue that the retail clinics pose serious competition.\n\nDr. VanBrakle said local pediatricians in the Lehigh Valley had not, in fact, noticed the retail clinic\u2019s having any impact on their practices. \u201cThe vast majority don\u2019t feel very strongly about it one way or the other,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Herman, of Mayo, says that rather than buck the trend, primary-care doctors should learn from it. He predicts that small groups of primary-care doctors around the country will begin working with hospitals to offer some of the same inducements as store clinics \u2014 like convenient locations and more consumer-friendly office hours, including periods of walk-in care requiring no appointment.\n\nThe primary-care doctors, he said, should try to beat the store clinics at their own game. As for the ones that lack a hospital connection, \"It will make it more difficult for them,\" Dr. Herman said.",

    "text": "It has been getting a little warm lately. In November 2015, Brits experienced the hottest November days ever recorded in the UK. That was shortly followed by news from the World Meteorological Organization that 2015 is likely to be the hottest year since records began.\n\nGlobal temperatures are now set to reach 1 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. That is halfway to the politically-agreed upper limit of 2 \u00b0C, which was set by world leaders in 2009.\n\nFor now at least, it seems the world\u2019s temperature is going to go up and up. So how hot could the Earth really get? Is there any limit to the amount of warming humans could eventually cause?\n\nClimate change is not a new experience for Earth. The planet has gone through countless temperature fluctuations over its 4.6-billion-year history, from frozen snowball to blazing tropical heat.\n\nWithout the greenhouse effect, the Earth would have an average temperature of -18 \u00b0C\n\nBut despite all these changes, Earth always swings back into roughly the same temperature range. That is because it has mechanisms in place to control its own temperature.\n\nA key one is the greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases in the air, mainly carbon dioxide, methane and water vapour, trap radiation from the Sun and act like a thermal blanket around the planet.\n\nWithout the greenhouse effect, the Earth would have an average temperature of -18 \u00b0C and be covered in ice. Life as we know it would not be able to survive. The greenhouse effect is clearly a good thing, but like all good things, it is possible to have too much.\n\nHumans have only been here for a relatively short time, yet we have managed to become the most significant driver of climate change on the planet. By burning fossil fuels and cutting down trees, we are releasing more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and that has caused temperatures to rise.\n\nBy the end of this century the world will be at least 4 \u00b0C warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, our rates of emissions more than quadrupled from the previous decade, and so far there is little sign of this upwards trend reversing. The question is, how much will all these extra greenhouse gases heat the planet over the coming decades and centuries?\n\nTo predict the state of the planet in the future, scientists build computer models that simulate what will happen to the Earth\u2019s climate. These models are vastly complicated, but they ultimately rely on basic physics such as how air and water behave. By incorporating both man-made and natural changes, the models can estimate how the climate will change when a given amount of greenhouse gases is emitted.\n\nThese predictions are compiled into reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), most recently in 2013-2014. They suggest that, if our greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase as they have been over the last 50 years, then by the end of this century the world will be at least 4 \u00b0C warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the warming will not stop at the end of this century.\n\nThe further forward we go in time, the harder it is to predict what will happen.\n\nModels currently suggest that we will reach 7 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2200, but that temperatures will then stabilise, provided we have stopped emitting greenhouse gases.\n\nClimate models can only make predictions based on what we know\n\nHowever, we cannot be certain of this, because the Earth\u2019s climate is a complex system. As the climate warms, several processes operate that can cause even more warming.\n\nFor instance, snow and ice melt away in a warmer world, exposing dark ground that absorbs the Sun\u2019s heat rather than reflecting it. Similarly, more water vapour evaporates from the surface, and since water vapour is a greenhouse gas this traps even more heat.\n\nThe oceans actually slow climate change, because carbon dioxide dissolves into them from the air. But warmer oceans can hold less carbon dioxide, leaving ever more in the atmosphere.\n\nThese feedbacks are relatively well understood, but others are harder to unravel: for example, how changing cloud cover will affect the climate, or when methane locked up in permafrost at the poles will be released. Climate models can only make predictions based on what we know, so as temperatures rise further beyond anything humans have experienced, their predictions become less reliable.\n\nSo rather than trying to predict what the climate will do from first principles, we can take another approach: we can look at what has happened in the past.\n\nAbout 55 million years ago, the Earth experienced one of the fastest temperature rises in its history.\n\nDuring the \u201cPalaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum\u201d (PETM), average sea surface temperatures reached up to 10 \u00b0C at the poles, compared to -2 \u00b0C today. It was a time when there were palm trees as far north as the Arctic Circle, with absolutely no ice at the poles. Some species flourished in the sweltering heat, while others were wiped out.\n\nThose gases warmed the planet by at least 5 \u00b0C and maybe as much as 8 \u00b0C\n\nIt is clear that greenhouse gases were the main driver. In particular, a massive amount of methane escaped from the seabed into the atmosphere, boosting the greenhouse effect.\n\nIt is not clear how the methane escaped. Volcanic eruptions or a comet impact have both been proposed, but the most likely explanation is that the Earth was already gradually warming for some other reason. When it reached a certain temperature, the methane stores under the seabed became unstable.\n\nThe PETM shows clear parallels to today\u2019s world. In particular, the pulse of greenhouse gases that set it in motion seems to have been roughly equivalent to what humans could release if we burnt all recoverable fossil fuels. Those gases warmed the planet by at least 5 \u00b0C and maybe as much as 8 \u00b0C, probably over a few thousand years.\n\nHow climate change will affect us\n\nSea level: predicted to rise by up to 1m by 2100\n\nExtreme weather: intense hurricanes may become more frequent\n\nDrought: more likely in mid-latitude regions, due to a combination of higher temperatures and 30% less rainfall\n\nFlooding: rainfall is predicted to increase in the tropics and at high latitudes, causing more frequent floods\n\nFood production: global crop yields predicted to decrease by over 30% by 2050\n\nExtinctions: species extinctions will become more likely, with 40% of ecosystems affected this century\n\nHuman health: increased instances of respiratory problems and infectious diseases\n\nSource: Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report, IPCC\n\nIs that the limit, or could the planet get even hotter than it was during the PETM?\n\nThere is a theoretical mechanism that could massively overheat the Earth: a \u201crunaway greenhouse effect\u201d.\n\nWe have already seen that heating the planet releases more greenhouse gases, causing yet more warming. In theory this self-feeding mechanism could become unstoppable, warming the planet by hundreds of degrees.\n\nThis has never happened on Earth: we would not be here if it had. But scientists believe that it happened to the nearest planet, Venus, 3-4 billion years ago.\n\nVenus is closer to the Sun than Earth, so it was hotter to begin with. On the surface, temperatures increased so much that all of its liquid water evaporated into the air. This water vapour trapped even more heat, and with no water on the surface there was nowhere to store carbon dioxide.\n\nThis led to extreme greenhouse conditions. Eventually all the water vapour was lost to space, leaving Venus with an atmosphere that is 96% carbon dioxide.\n\nThe planet now has a global temperature of 462 \u00b0C. That is hot enough to melt lead, and makes Venus the hottest planet in the solar system: even beating out Mercury, which is closer to the Sun.\n\nIt is almost certain that Earth will succumb to such a catastrophe in a few billion years\u2019 time.\n\nAs the Sun gets older, it will slowly run out of fuel and swell up into a red giant star. Eventually it will become so bright that the Earth will no longer be able to dissipate the extra heat out into space. The planet\u2019s surface temperature will increase, boiling the oceans and triggering a runaway greenhouse effect that will end all life as we know it, leaving Earth baking under a thick shroud of carbon dioxide.\n\nIt seems that the likelihood of us being steam-cooked is pretty low\n\nHowever, these changes to the Sun will happen over billions of years, so they are not a pressing problem. The question is, could we trigger a runaway greenhouse effect ourselves?\n\nA study published in 2013 suggests that it is possible, but we would have to release a truly staggering amount of carbon dioxide. This gas currently makes up almost 400 parts per million of the air, up from 280ppm before the Industrial Revolution. To trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, we would have to get the level up to 30,000ppm.\n\nThat would take about 10 times more carbon dioxide than could be released if we burned all known fossil fuels. There are other sources of greenhouse gases, like the seabed methane that escaped during the PETM, so we cannot absolutely rule it out. But it seems that the likelihood of us being steam-cooked is pretty low.\n\nClearly, that does not mean heating up the planet is a safe thing to do. A temperature rise of just a few \u00b0C will have all sorts of unwelcome impacts (see \"Climate impacts\"). In particular, parts of the planet could still get too hot for humans to survive.\n\nIn the hottest places on Earth today, like California\u2019s Death Valley, temperatures can reach well over 50 \u00b0C. Such heat is dangerous, but with proper care it is survivable. That is because the air is dry, so we can cool ourselves by sweating.\n\nA 12 \u00b0C rise in temperature would render half of the Earth\u2019s land area uninhabitable\n\nIt can be trickier if the air is both hot and humid, as in tropical jungles. The moisture in the air means our sweat evaporates more slowly, so it is harder to cool down.\n\nThe best way to assess the combination of heat and humidity is to measure the \u201cwet-bulb temperature\u201d. This is the temperature a thermometer reads if the bulb is wrapped in a damp cloth and a fan is blowing air over it. If you are sweating, this is the lowest temperature that you could cool your skin to.\n\nHumans have to maintain a core body temperature of 37 \u00b0C. To ensure that we can always cool off, we keep our skin at around 35 \u00b0C. This implies that a wet-bulb temperature of 35 \u00b0C or above, if it was sustained for more than a few hours, would be fatal. Even if we could survive it, we would have to sit still.\n\nEven in the most sweltering tropical rainforests, the maximum wet-bulb temperatures recorded have never exceeded 31 \u00b0C. This is because hot and humid air is unstable. It rises and cooler air sweeps in beneath, which is what causes tropical thunderstorms.\n\nAir can only rise if the air around it is cooler and denser. So if climate change heats up the tropics, the air will have to be even hotter and more humid before it starts to rise. A study published in 2010 estimated that, with each 1 \u00b0C rise in average global temperature, the maximum wet-bulb temperature will rise by 0.75 \u00b0C.\n\nThat leads to some intimidating conclusions. A 7 \u00b0C rise in global temperatures, which we might well hit by 2200, will render some parts of the globe inhospitable to human life. A 12 \u00b0C rise in temperature would render half of the Earth\u2019s land area uninhabitable.\n\nOf course, we might try to adapt by installing huge amounts of air-conditioning equipment. But apart from being colossally expensive, this would imprison people inside buildings for days or weeks at a time.\n\nEven if this never comes to pass, on current trends it is likely that Earth will be 4 \u00b0C warmer by the end of this century than it was before the Industrial Revolution, and 3 \u00b0C warmer than it is now. That would not directly kill us or render parts of the planet uninhabitable, but it will still create enormous upheaval.\n\n20,000 years ago, the Earth was about 4 \u00b0C cooler than it is now. This period is known as the \u201cLast Glacial Maximum\u201d. Ice sheets covered most of Canada and northern Europe, including all of the British Isles.\n\nSince then Earth has warmed up by 4 \u00b0C. That was enough to remove the ice sheets from Europe and North America. The meltwater from the retreating ice raised sea levels by tens of metres, drowning shallow lands beneath the waves.\n\nWhen you consider that, it is easy to imagine what another 4 \u00b0C rise in temperature could do to the world around us.",

Residents were ordered to immediately evacuate and given one day to correct the violations, the report shows.\n\nTogether, the Mastrine twins said they\u2019ve heard of about a dozen inspections throughout the Bay Area and one eviction in San Francisco. Seven inhabitants of a converted warehouse in Bernal Heights last week received an eviction notice from their landlord.\n\nThe Bernal Heights warehouse underwent its scheduled city inspection around 10 a.m. Tuesday, said resident Nathan Cottam \u2014 about the same time as the Building Inspection Commission meeting. While results of the inspection will take some time, Cottam said it went \u201cas well as it could have.\u201d He said he supports the goal of the petition to give residents more notice, considering they only got the word about a weekahead of their inspection.\n\n\u201cThe unnecessary stress of it, of someone coming into your space, and hearing that other warehouses were evicted, was very unnecessarily stressful, and all it brought was added trauma to an already traumatic situation,\u201d Amy Mastrine said.\n\nEven before the Oakland fire, San Francisco\u2019s building and planning departments had joined with the Fire Department to establish a prevention task force that seeks to bring spaces \u2014 often illegal ones \u2014 up to code before inspections, said Tom Hui, director of the city Department of Building Inspection.\n\nSafety is the first concern of city officials, he said, adding that there were no plans to halt inspections forthright. That outreach matters, Hui said, because once inspectors \u201cgo in, we cannot do selective code enforcement,\u201d meaning they can\u2019t ignore clear-cut violations.\n\n\u201cOur community is important to us,\u201d Hui said. \u201cWe love the community. But fire safety is the No. 1 concern for us.\u201d\n\nAmy Mastrine \u2014 who has lived in the Potrero Hill warehouse since October, paying $1,000 a month for a space where she can paint \u2014 contended that she and her \u201cradical artist sentiments\u201d started taking fire safety more seriously after the Oakland fire.\n\nResidents held a fire safety meeting, she said, pointing out exits, to which the building\u2019s manager later painted large arrows on the floor. The building\u2019s manager also installed a new exit door and ordered a fire escape ladder to the roof, as well as a \u201cwhole bunch\u201d of fire extinguishers, she said.\n\nMany artists who live in such spaces resent the government interfering in their do-it-yourself makeshift homes, and Amy Mastrine\u2019s warehouse \u2014 with its massive mirrors, panel-style art, bike storage nook and plants growing in the sun \u2014 is no exception.\n\n\u201cMy space is safe,\u201d Amy Mastrine said. \u201cWe took the fire seriously, without any bullying. ... My strongest point, I think, is that we can take care of our own, and we really don\u2019t need to be policed in this way.\u201d\n\nLt. Jonathan Baxter, a spokesman for the San Francisco Fire Department, said that if inspectors give a notice of violation to a living or working space, its occupants are usually given 72 hours to fix things. But that can be extended, he said, as long as there are clear signs of progress, so \u201cwe don\u2019t basically have to vacate individuals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going out and saying, \u2018Here\u2019s your violation. Fix it. If it\u2019s not fixed within this certain parameter of time, we\u2019re going to go to the next step.\u2019 We\u2019re very open to working with all members of the community, as long as we\u2019re moving forward toward that safety goal.\u201d\n\nMichael Bodley is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Imagine you walk into a room, and the room is dynamic. And with your permission and all of that, you are interacting with the things going on in the room.\u201d\n\nThat's definitely something that we've heard before, from a lot of people.

Whether consumers are interested in all of them is a different matter, but there's no doubt there's a movement to get just about everything online.\n\nAnd that's all Schmidt is saying here. It's not that the Internet is going away, just that it will quite literally be less visible. Eventually, you won't even think about whether you're on the Internet or not -- you'll just assume you are, all the time.\n\nHayley Tsukayama covers consumer technology for The Washington Post.",

    "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 In a move that stunned Hollywood, the television industry\u2019s most powerful woman, Anne M. Sweeney, said on Tuesday that she would step down as president of the Disney-ABC Television Group to become a TV director.\n\nExecutives of the Walt Disney Company and Ms. Sweeney, 56, emphasized in interviews that she made a voluntary decision to leave an empire that includes ABC, hundreds of cable channels around the world, a chain of eight local TV stations, Radio Disney and a portion of Hulu and A & E Networks. She turned down a new three-year contract, instead signing a one-year extension that lasts until late January.\n\nBut Hollywood instantly read her decision as an acknowledgment that her 18-year rise at the world\u2019s largest entertainment company had ended. In recent years, Disney has positioned other senior executives as likelier candidates to succeed Robert A. Iger as chief executive when he steps down in July 2016.\n\nAlthough Mr. Iger has not commented publicly on his succession, it is well known within Disney that two other executives are the leading contenders: James A. Rasulo, chief financial officer, and Thomas O. Staggs, chairman of Disney\u2019s theme park unit. (Disney has repeatedly and aggressively rejected rumors that Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer and a Disney board member, is also in the mix.)\n\nMs. Sweeney, who also holds the title of co-chairwoman of Disney Media Networks, a division that includes ESPN, said in an interview that she had made it clear to Disney that she did not want Mr. Iger\u2019s post. \u201cI appreciate the fact that so many people have wanted it for me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want Bob\u2019s job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you sit behind these big desks, you don\u2019t truly get to touch the creative process, and that is an opportunity I wanted to give myself,\u201d she continued. \u201cOnce Bob lifted his jaw off his desk, we had a very robust, fun, happy conversation about it.\u201d\n\nWhile Ms. Sweeney spoke in an interview of routinely visiting sets and poring over scripts, she was not widely seen as a hands-on creative executive at any of the channels she oversaw, which is one reason her announced intention to become a director flabbergasted the industry. She is also leaving one of the biggest jobs in entertainment: The Hollywood Reporter trade magazine has ranked her as the industry\u2019s most powerful female executive for five years.\n\nOne of the oldest jokes in the entertainment business is the actor declaring that what he or she really wants to do is direct, but Ms. Sweeney had apparently never made this desire known to colleagues, nor had she taken steps to prepare. \u201cI\u2019m going to shadow some directors,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people have already reached out.\u201d\n\nWhile it is possible that Ms. Sweeney could find employment directing TV programs for Disney, either in the children\u2019s arena or for ABC, she said it was too soon to say exactly how she might make her new career debut.\n\nIn a separate interview, Mr. Iger declined to say who might take over for Ms. Sweeney, although he said it would be an internal hire. He said an announcement would come sooner than later. \u201cAnne runs a sprawling, important, global division, parts of which are seeing fast-paced change and a fair amount of challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fortunately have a deep bench of talented, smart, experienced people.\u201d\n\nRegarding Ms. Sweeney\u2019s decision to leave Disney to pursue directing, Mr. Iger said: \u201cThere is nothing below the surface here. I offered her a new multiyear contract, and she came back and said she wanted to do this instead.\u201d He added: \u201cI was somewhat incredulous. I didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d\n\nMs. Sweeney, who spent 12 years at Nickelodeon and three years at FX before joining Disney, is known as a highly polished executive with substantial skills in the art of corporate politics. Analysts estimate that her divisions generated $11.9 billion in revenue and $2.6 billion in profit last year.\n\nHer r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which is larded with awards, includes helping Disney become the first major TV supplier to join iTunes and building Disney Channel into a juggernaut. She is also credited with turning around ABC\u2019s news division by hiring Ben Sherwood to take it over in 2010. Among other feats, Mr. Sherwood ended the morning dominance that NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show had for 16 years. ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d is now the top morning show, raking in the profits that go with that status.\n\nMr. Sherwood is prominent on the list of possible successors to Ms. Sweeney, along with Nancy Dubuc, the president of the hugely successful A & E Networks. Gary Marsh, president of Disney Channels Worldwide, and Benjamin N. Pyne, president of global distribution for Disney Media Networks, have also been mentioned as contenders.\n\nABC\u2019s program lineup has not achieved nearly as much success under Ms. Sweeney\u2019s watch as the cable channels, though the network had a period of success starting a decade ago when it introduced three hit shows in one season, \u201cDesperate Housewives,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cLost.\u201d\n\nThat success became somewhat fraught for Ms. Sweeney because of a long-term conflict with the network\u2019s top program executive at the time, Stephen McPherson. ABC executives reported at the time that Mr. McPherson eventually refused to report to Ms. Sweeney or even often to speak to her. After the network endured several fallow seasons, Ms. Sweeney managed to prevail in the standoff and Mr. McPherson was fired in 2010.\n\nMs. Sweeney has a much better relationship with her choice to replace him, Paul Lee, though ABC has continued to struggle, partly because it is the only network without any significant sports programming, and thus heavily dependent on female viewers.\n\nPerhaps demonstrating her political acumen \u2014 or directing skill, depending on your point of view \u2014 Ms. Sweeney chose to disclose her departure in a carefully orchestrated cover article in The Hollywood Reporter. Disney executives said Ms. Sweeney chose that outlet to send a specific message: I\u2019m done being a business leader; I now want to be seen as a member of the creative trenches.\n\nStill, one Disney executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Ms. Sweeney will continue to oversee his division for a time, said the overall internal reaction \u2014 which mirrored the reaction of others in the industry \u2014 was bemusement at Ms. Sweeney\u2019s planned career change.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe best line I have heard is: \u2018Disney makes fairy tales, don\u2019t they?\u2019 \u201d",

    "text": "Director of the University of Southern California's Unruh Institute of Politics; communications director for John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign\n\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan famously said that we are all entitled to our own opinions but not our own facts. He did not address whether we are each entitled to our own view of history. On that answer rests the outcome of the November elections.\n\nThe basic underpinnings of the economy will not change over the next eight weeks, nor will voters' feelings about their own economic prospects. Public opinion on Afghanistan and Iraq, health care, immigration, and climate change have all hardened as well. The outcome now rests solely on which party's explanation of recent American history voters find more credible and, more specifically, who they believe has occupied the White House in the years since Bill Clinton left office.\n\nThe Democratic alternative suggests that Barack Obama became president approximately 45 minutes ago. Since then, he has repaired U.S. relationships with the rest of the world and reformed Wall Street. But he will require more time to fix George Bush's economy.\n\nThe Republican version says that Bush was never president, except for a few days in 2001 to cut taxes and rally the country after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He then disappeared for six years and returned briefly to authorize the troop surge in Iraq.\n\nThis historical tug of war is grounded in the broader finger-pointing exercise of determining who is to blame for the state of the economy. If the Democrats are to reverse the trend lines, they will have to find a way to convince unhappy voters that the party in power should not bear the brunt of their anger.\n\nDirector of survey research at the Pew Research Center\n\nNeither party has much incentive to reach across the aisle this fall.\n\nFor Democrats, motivating their base is critical, but they're unlikely to achieve that through bipartisanship. And their sizable legislative accomplishments -- which they hoped would appeal both to their base and to independents -- have not gotten a very positive public reaction, given the continuing economic troubles. In fact, a July Pew Research poll found far more people thinking the government's policies have benefited the wealthy and large corporations than the middle class. Passing more legislation this fall is not apt to change public perceptions about the Democrats' record, at least before Election Day.\n\nFor their part, Republicans have little incentive to cooperate with Democrats, given how negative public opinion is about the Democratic Congress. But the GOP is poorly regarded as well -- in part because of its successful efforts to block major parts of the Democratic legislative agenda. Unlike in 1994, the public now dislikes the GOP as much or more than it does the Democrats. Polls notwithstanding, that makes the outcome in November less certain than it might otherwise be.\n\nOne thing many members of both parties agree on is the value of sending money home to their constituents, despite the fact that leaders of both parties have vowed to reduce or eliminate earmarks and pork-barrel spending. The public dislikes pork in theory but not in practice: 68 percent of Americans told CBS in March that \"earmarks\" or \"pork\" are \"not acceptable.\" But an August Pew Research poll found 53 percent saying they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who has a record \"of bringing government projects and money\" to their district. So support for more of this kind of spending is potentially the only significant legislating we will see this fall.\n\nSenior vice president for communications at Center for American Progress; deputy press secretary in the Clinton White House\n\nRepublicans will be loath to do anything to upset the current political dynamic, and I suspect Rep. John Boehner's promised \"Contract With America\" will either never see the light of day or be completely devoid of substance. This is probably good for Republicans and bad for Democrats.\n\nThe Republicans' 1994 Contract With America was the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal fall for those of us who were then on the Clinton White House staff. Finally, we had a means of defining the midterms as a choice between two agendas as opposed to a referendum on President Bill Clinton. The contract came out too late for the '94 Democrats to turn around that election. But the spending cuts proposed in the contract proved to be congressional Republicans' undoing in their subsequent budget battles with the president and helped define the choice for voters between Clinton and Bob Dole in 1996.\n\nIf Republicans won't cooperate, congressional Democrats will have to define the choice on their own. They can highlight key issues. Many are focusing on Rep. Paul Ryan's economic plan, which supports privatization of Social Security. Democrats in the House could force a series of votes on the expiring Bush tax cuts that would show the Democrats as being on the side of the middle class and the Republicans on the side of corporations and the wealthiest. Arguing that Democrats want to go forward and Republicans want to go back is a good frame -- but candidates need some substance that demonstrates what the Republicans would actually do if they are going to turn that message-frame into a meaningful choice for voters.\n\nPolitical analyst for ABC News; columnist for National Journal; chief strategist for George W. Bush's 2004 presidential campaign\n\nVoters' perceptions of Congress are toxic. In most polls, trust in the federal government, and Congress in particular, is at an all-time low. Thus Republican candidates have a significant advantage over most years even though the public doesn't have a particularly favorable perception of them, either. So over the next 60 days both parties will relentlessly attack each other in very negative ways, as they have been doing over the past month. There are no winners in this political conversation, and it is unlikely that any significant legislation will be passed before the election.\n\nRepublicans will take advantage of the negative environment by trying to pile on. Democrats will try to deflect these attacks by going negative on Republican candidates with messages such as \"you might not like us, but you surely will like the alternative less.\" Republican attacks will probably be more effective because they reflect current attitudes, while Democrats will have to reach back to the past and try to cast President George W. Bush as responsible for the current situation. This won't work well since voters respond more to recent history rather than an older version of problems.\n\nIn the end, Democrats should hope and pray and work at improving President Obama's image, since his approval rating will be the factor with the greatest impact on the election. But Democrats are unlikely to do that, and voters will face a constant barrage of negative messaging from both sides.\n\nChairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 1995 to 1998; representative from Texas from 1979 to 2005\n\nThe press, which travels in a pack, has been overstating the Republican chances for taking control of the House. That doesn't mean the GOP can't win the House, but it is far from a foregone conclusion. Democrats must make it clear externally and internally that they are competitive. This means recasting their races, drawing sharp contrasts between themselves and their opponents. Republicans will try to make the election a referendum on the Democratic Party, so Democrats must make the campaign a contest between the two individuals on the ballot.\n\nFor example, Republicans will try to run away from the crazy pronouncements by some of their Tea Party nominees and party leaders about privatizing Social Security and Medicare; Democrats need to press their GOP opponents on these issues. Democrats also must pound their GOP opponents on the near-unanimous Republican congressional vote against providing funding for states and local governments to keep teachers, police officers and firefighters working this fall. Democrats can retain both the House and the Senate if they make it abundantly clear this election is about a choice between responsible mainstream Democrats and fringe Republican nominees who would take the country in a dangerous direction.\n\nChair of the Republican Leadership Council; governor of New Jersey from 1994 to 2001\n\nBoth parties in Congress will continue to hammer their base issues until Election Day.\n\nRepublicans will focus on President Obama and the ways his administration has failed to tackle the economic problems we faced in 2008, and still face, and they will critique the rampant spending that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Obama have overseen. As part of this fiscal message, Republicans will no doubt highlight President George W. Bush's middle-class tax cuts, which Obama might allow to expire. I suspect Republicans will also hammer immigration, a topic that preys on economic fears and highlights an issue on which Obama has not acted enough.\n\nThe Democrats will probably try to take the tax issue away from Republicans with a payroll-tax holiday, by reinstating the research and development tax credit or something similar. They will tout Obama's legislative achievements and kept promises, including health-care and financial industry reforms.\n\nThe continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- despite Obama's withdrawal plans -- are a double-edged sword for both parties. How these conflicts play politically this fall will depend on how much terrorist activity we see in the coming weeks.\n\nFinally, both parties will be watching Tea Party voters, who have the momentum right now -- and how they will affect the November outcome is still unknown.",

    "text": "BUENOS AIRES, April 1 (AP)\u2014Alejandro Lavorante, for\u00admer Argentine heavyweight champion, died today in Mendoza as the result of ring injuries suffered a year and a half ago. He was 27 years old.\n\nLavorante was the third well\u00adknown boxer to die from injuries in recent years.\n\nBenny Paret of New York the welterweight champion, died April 3, 1962, after having been knocked out by Emile Griffith of New York in the 12th round of a fight at Madison Square Garden on March 24, 1962.\n\nDavey Moore of Los Angeles, the featherweight titleholder, died March 25, 1963, after hav\u00ading been knocked out by Urti\u00adminio (Sugar) Ramos of Cuba in the 10th round of a title bout in Los Angeles on March 21, 1963.\n\nLavorante never fully recov\u00adered consciousness after a freak\u00adish knockout by Johnny Riggins in Los Angeles on Sept. 21,1962. He underwent three brain oper\u00adations, the first only hours after the knockout.\n\nIn time he learned to speak a few words, to walk from a wheelchair to his bed and to eat his food unassisted\n\nHe was taken home to Ro\u00adsario, Argentina, after eight months in a Los Angeles hos\u00adpital and seemed to understand where he was going. But doc\u00adtors never held out hope for his complete recovery\n\n\u201cI just kept hoping and pray\u00ading he would come through. He was a good fighter and could have gone up.\u201d said Riggins to\u00adday in San Francisco when he heard of Lavorante's death.\n\n3 Knockouts in 6 Months\n\nThe knockout by Riggins, a little\u2010known heavyweight, was the third suffered by Lavorante in six months. He had been stopped by the former light\u00adheavyweight champion, Archie Moore, in 10 rounds on March 30, 1962. Cassius Clay, now world heavyweight champion, knocked him out in the fifth round on July 20, 1962.\n\nBefore his first knockout de\u00adfeat, by Moore, Lavorante had beaten such fighters as Zora Folley, Willi Besmanoff, Alonzo Johnson and Von Clay in 1961\n\nEarly in 1963 the boxer's father, Alejandro Lavorante Sr., obtained a court order per\u00admitting him to take his son back to Argentina. The journey was made on June 30, after the fighter's parents had set\u00adtled a claim for $9,878 in unpaid income taxes.\n\nThe California Boxers and Wrestlers Fund paid part of Lavorante's Los Angeles hospi\u00adtal expenses. California Luth\u00aderan Hospital dropped an at\u00adtempt to collect the remainder of the bill before Lavorante was taken home.\n\nAfter his return, he under\u00adwent therapeutic treatment at a Rosario clinic and later was taken home. Doctors said he showed some signs of improve\u00adment there, although he never fully regained consciousness and his weight dropped to 165 pounds.\n\nIn Des Moines, Iowa, Lavo\u00adrante's manager, Paul L. (Pink\u00adie) George, said he thought it was a mistake to return Lay\u00adorante to Argentina. He said he thought the boxer would have received better care in the U nited States.\n\nThe funeral will be at Men\u00addoza tomorrow.\n\nThis article can be viewed in its original form.

    "text": "Chinese and Angolan workers in Luanda, Angola, in March.\n\nThe people that the Chinese are often most worried about are other Chinese.\n\nChinese living and working abroad have played an enormous role in the country's economic boom. For years, they have sent money back and offered hope to those at home during periods of calamity and chaos.\n\nPhoto of performance work by artist Ji Shengli, who was born in China in 1967 in Xining, Qinghai province.\n\nYet holding a foreign passport doesn't make these expatriates any less Chinese. Of all people, they are expected to be most attuned to the complex realities of life in China. When they fall short, they are treated with official suspicion and individual disdain.\n\nWhen I first studied in Beijing in 1974 I had a Canadian classmate who was classified as a \"Patriotic Overseas Chinese.\" The status afforded her special access to people and her ethnicity meant that otherwise distant Chinese students embraced her. She always made the point that her background gave her insights into China and its revolution, things beyond the ken of Caucasians like me.\n\n\"You simply don't understand China's unique national conditions.\" This common refrain is still chimed with certainty, and stridency, by average citizens, just as leaders of the party-state employ it when addressing foreigners. Unless you appreciate, and accept unequivocally, China's \"unique national conditions\" you betray yourself as lacking insight into and empathy with the mysteries of that country's tortured history and complex present realities.\n\nThis kind of talk allows for a kind of \"Chinese exceptionalism.\" People employ it whether they are rejecting well-intentioned observations on social mores or staring down the incredulity of outsiders confronted by egregious political and mercantile behavior. Not only can the criticism of outsiders be deflected in this fashion, even those with intimate ties to the country are frequently derided for failing to appreciate China's conditions. Sometimes, individuals are taught a lesson about the country's peculiarities by means of a long stint in jail.\n\nIn the past few months there have been two cases of Chinese insiders who have been tried and jailed in murky circumstances. The Australian businessman Stern Hu was sentenced in March, accused of taking bribes, and earlier this month the U.S. citizen and geologist Xue Feng, reportedly tortured during a long pre-trial ordeal, was jailed for eight years on charges of espionage. Both men were involved in the resources industry and there is speculation that the severity of their sentences reflects the sensitivities of the Chinese in all matters related to resource security. However, it was presumed that both Messrs. Hu and Xue might have been treated more leniently because they are foreign nationals who were offered open consular support by their adoptive countries.\n\nBoth men are members of China's new-era globalized citizens. They are post-modern overseas Chinese. That is, like many previous generations of Chinese, for reasons of family, fate or personal fortune they sought a life outside the country of their birth. However, due to the economic boom of recent years and the extraordinary opportunities it has offered, they choose to work for foreign companies back in China.\n\nThe 20 countries with the largest ethnic Chinese populations, born inside or outside of China, in 2005.\n\nHistorically, overseas Chinese have been men and women who although identifying as Chinese, or only even partially Chinese, elect to reside primarily overseas. In recent years, however, the category of sojourning Chinese has broadened to incorporate those former citizens of the People's Republic who went overseas in search of a better education, jobs and lifestyle. Presuming that their foreign passports and international connections provide them with a measure of protection, they shuttle freely between China and global commercial centers, partaking in the migratory existence of the international business elite. They can maintain a pride in China while enjoying the benefits of being foreign citizens.\n\nA diaspora of overseas Chinese developed during the 19th century as the Qing Empire went into economic and social decline. Since then generations of Chinese have contributed to societies and cultures all over the world. They became important members of communities throughout Southeast Asia, North America, Australia and the Pacific long before modern China found a role for them.\n\nFamilies and communities might benefit from those connections, but in a world in which local clan ties and narrow loyalties were paramount, the sojourners were frequently derided for being \"pseudo-foreign Devils,\" tainted by the untoward manners and ideas of foreign climes.\n\nDuring China's reform era starting in 1978, and in particular in the past two decades, countless overseas Chinese have been playing a crucial role in China's economic reform. They have also contributed in a myriad of ways to the integration of their homeland in the global economy. To be Chinese by birth, or even to enjoy Chinese ancestry, there is an all-too-often stated expectation that you understand the overt rules as well as the unspoken codes of your native land. Intuitively you are supposed to understand and be vigilant about China's particular situation and conditions.\n\nAustralian businessman Stern Hu, above, and U.S. citizen and geologist Xue Feng, below, were both recently tried and jailed in China.\n\nWhen things go well and there are opportunities to be grasped, the overseas Chinese, with their inside-track appreciation of the distinctive modus operandi in the People's Republic, ride high. When the complex nexus of national interest, party-family ties, local power brokers and influence peddlers is antagonized, however, these intuitive insiders, the commercial compradors with local knowledge, are particularly vulnerable. The protective sheath of foreign citizenship proves to be little more than a gossamer.\n\nSome Chinese were studying overseas during the heady months of the mass protest movement of 1989, and large numbers decided to keep away following the brutal repression of June 4. It seemed as though the economic and social changes allowed by the Communist Party until then would be stalled. Eventually, the economic reforms continued and transformed the country in unexpected ways, but the lessons of 1989 were not lost on China's leaders. They instituted a vast educational and media campaign to instruct young and old alike in China's unique realities.\n\nPhotograph by Tseng Kwong Chi, from the Expeditionary Self-Portrait Series 1979-1989/Muna Tseng Dance Projects.\n\nThose conditions, hard to define at the best of times, include an official menu of factoids and attitudes: China has an unbroken recorded history of 5,000 years; it is a multi-ethnic nation incorporating peoples as varied as the Han, Tibetans, Uighurs and Dai; historical necessity and contemporary realities determine that only the unified leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can maintain stability and pursue China's unique path to modernity ensuring economic prosperity for all. It also includes such nebulous claims that there is a particular \"Chinese\" way of doing things, that Chinese people have a unique purchase on the world of the spirit, and that although China is a global culture only Chinese can really understand it.\n\nSaturating textbooks, films, TV programs and the news media, awareness has become part of the fabric of contemporary Chinese life and thought. The success of the two-decade-long campaign is evident, for example, in the patriotic demagoguery of the Chinese Internet, as well as in everyday nationalistic fervor. Chinese living overseas as well as foreign Chinese working in China are equally expected to get with the program.\n\nNonetheless, overseas Chinese will remain profoundly enmeshed in the story of China in the 21st century. The fate of individuals like Stern Hu and Xue Feng elicit comment and concern, but on a far greater scale new populations in Africa and Latin America, as well as throughout the Pacific and in towns and cities in Europe and Russia, will provide other dimensions to the global Chinese presence. In turn complex new dynamics are developing, not only for foreign communities, but for China itself.\n\nIt is here that the Chinese party-state's treatment of individual figures like Messrs. Hu and Xue is instructive. Following the detention of each of these individuals their cases remained shrouded in secrecy, their treatment at times arbitrary and cruel. Falling victim to Chinese-style due process their families, as well as the diplomatic representatives of their new countries, were aghast and dismayed. If the Chinese authorities were using the jailing and sentencing of these two men to offer a cautionary tale, the lessons they broadcast not only to the world, but to the broader overseas Chinese community, are profoundly disturbing.\n\nWhile many commentators have remarked on the revived and invented traditions popular in China today, it was in the early years of the Republic of China in the 1910s and '20s that the modern transposition of traditional ethical and moral categories began. Along with more benign values such as \"humanness\" and \"rightness,\" the concept of \"loyalty\" was instilled with a new meaning. Fealty to the ruling monarch was replaced with loyalty to the state and the nation.\n\nLao Chen, the protagonist in the controversial 2009 novel \"In an Age of Prosperity: China 2013\" by Chan Koon-chung (also known as \"The Gilded Age\" in English), is a Hong Kong resident of Beijing. He lives in a near-future utopia. The year is 2013 and China is the dominant economic power in the world, the society is stable and its citizens enjoy boundless consumer wealth. Harmony, the one-word slogan promoted by Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, reigns supreme. So what if the ever-vigilant and paternalistic government exacts a heavy price for social order and individual quiescence?\n\nBut Lao Chen senses something is wrong. He knows people are happy enough with \"90% freedom,\" but he wonders what is really missing. There is an inexplicable gap in everyone's memories, a lost month, and vagueness surrounds it. It is as though the society itself has been anaesthetized. Smug satisfaction disguises an unmistakable putrescence. Whenever he voices his unease, Lao Chen comes up against a brick wall. People tell him that, despite his long years in Beijing, he still doesn't understand China's realities.\n\nSurely the situation cannot continue in this political stasis for long? Political reform, a government more open to oversight and criticism, a free media and independent judiciary\u2014perhaps these are all part of the next stage in the Chinese story? But such hopes fly in the face of China's \"unique national conditions.\" Late in the novel a 40-page justification for the repressive harmony of China today is offered by a fictional Politburo member, He Dongsheng. To quote Linda Jaivin's translation of a passage from He's speech:\n\n\"Let's just keep the situation as is; after another 20 years of stable development we can reopen the discussion about reform. For the moment, at most, we could try to reform a few things here and there, as part of a gradual move towards benevolent government\u2026 Political reform? Is it that simple? In the end, you'll emerge from the transition, not with the commonwealth you desire, not the European style of social democracy or the American style of a free, democratic constitutional government, but rather a Chinese-style fascist dictatorship that's a compendium of nationalism, cultural traditionalism, patriotism and national racial purity.\"\n\nThe book's author, Mr. Chan, is a publisher from Hong Kong who has been living in Beijing since the 1990s. He has knowingly created a fictional account of Chinese reality. In discussing his work Mr. Chan has observed that dealing with China today demands a talent similar to that of the famous Tang-dynasty singer Jiang Shu. She was an artist who could sing two songs at once: one in the back of her throat and the other through her nose. \"Two-song Jiang Shu\" lived over a millennium ago, but today her talent enmeshes Chinese people, regardless of what passport they happen to hold.\n\nThe Chinese authorities claim a monopoly right to define and interpret the nation's unique conditions. In reality, social change, evolving attitudes and widespread aspirations continue to challenge the status quo. Mao Zedong honed his revolutionary instincts on Chinese soil rather than studying overseas, yet it was his foreign-education colleagues who were directly responsible for the opening up and reform of China that is changing the world.",

You won\u2019t regret it!\u201d\n\nMr. Netanyahu placed Kaia in quarantine for 10 days beginning Thursday while her behavior is assessed.

    "text": "One of the vehicles that made its North American debut at the Javits Center this past spring was the 2014 Toyota Highlander. This crossover, which has incrementally gained in size over its previous two generations, remains the brand's mass market mid-sized offering, largely pushing the truck based 4Runner into an off road capable niche that most drivers don't require.\n\nThe most obvious change coming for 2014 is a totally redone exterior. The wheelbase wrapped by this new sheet metal also ensures the available third row seating that will accommodate up to eight passengers is not the shoehorned afterthought of the second generation Highlander. In the previous generation, third row access was best performed by acrobatic children and when the third row was deployed the cargo room was too severely compromised. The new Highlander has reset the balance on passenger comfort and cargo room. The second row now offers either 40/60 bench style seating for three passengers or two captain\u2019s seats with a stowaway tray with cup holders between them. Access to the third row has been made easier by the addition of one step forward sliding tip up chair in the second row. The revised second row access affords a critical three inches more opening to the third row. Now adults can scramble back there too.\n\nThe third row itself sees an interior width increase of over four inches and features a recline ability that provides for decent seating for as many as three passengers. As in the second row, the third splits 40/60 for minivan style cargo convenience. An increase of the Highlander's rear overhang by three inches also provides the cargo area behind the third row with an added one-third volume increase over the previous generation. Making the new Highlander's accessibility even better is a one touch power open and close rear lift gate.\n\nSuch thoughtful details abound throughout the new Highlander. The chassis has been stiffened with an increased use of high tensile steel. Toyota claims that the Highlander's noise, vibration, and harshness measurements are improved by the use of an acoustical glass windshield and a 30 percent increase in the use of sound deadening materials in the floor. Vibrations are subdued through relocation of the three hydraulic engine mounts, relocation of the exhaust mounts, and an increase in the coverage of the dashboard silencer.\n\nAs before, the Highlander will be coming with three drivetrain options. A 2.7L four-cylinder engine with variable valve timing mated to six-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission appears in the base models equipped with front wheel drive. Most Highlanders will come equipped in an all wheel drive format, powered by a 3.5L V6, also sporting variable valve timing and coupled to an electronically controlled six speed transmission. Finally, that same engine is teamed with a electrical motor to create the hybrid version of the vehicle.\n\nThe refined AWD system on Highlanders so equipped features the ability to divert available torque in power configurations of 100% front wheel drive to a true 50/50 split.\n\nDid you find this article helpful?

For that matter, the country may not know who has won a Senate majority at any time in November.\n\nThat\u2019s because Louisiana, one of the central races in this year\u2019s midterm elections, holds its Senate elections in an unusual way. On Nov. 4, it will hold what\u2019s known as a jungle primary, with multiple Republicans running against Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat. If no one receives more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two candidates face each other in a runoff, which will not be held until Dec. 6.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019s newly released forecast model for the Senate \u2014 part of the introduction of The Upshot, a website covering politics and other subjects \u2014 currently assigns a one-in-12 chance that Senate control will come down to a runoff in Louisiana. And one in 12 is a real chance: It\u2019s about the same odds that a major league at-bat will result in an extra-base hit (a double, triple or home run).\n\nNationwide, the Republicans are all but guaranteed to pick up seats this year. The president\u2019s party tends to lose seats in midterm elections, and several Democratic incumbents are running for re-election in states that lean Republican.\n\nBut the Republicans\u2019 odds of picking up the six seats they need to gain control of the Senate have fallen in recent weeks, as a result of some unfavorable polls in Arkansas and Iowa. On April 1, our model gave the Republicans a 54 percent chance of taking control. As of Tuesday, those odds had dropped to 49 percent.\n\nWe realize some people will read that number to mean we\u2019re predicting the Democrats will hold the Senate, but we would advise against that. Either 49 percent or 54 percent is essentially a coin flip. One of our goals at The Upshot will be to help people understand that a number like 54 percent does not mean winning. It\u2019s tempting to interpret it as a flipped switch, but even events with a 10 percent chance happen all the time. (Well, 10 percent of the time.)\n\nAbove all, it\u2019s clear that this year\u2019s campaign is likely to be close. The odds have already changed in the last few weeks. They\u2019re sure to change again.",

(Dave Cleaveland/ Maineimaging.com)\n\nThe U.S. Navy's brand new $4.3 billion stealth destroyer, the Zumwalt, came to the rescue of a fisherman suffering chest pains early Saturday off the coast of Maine.\n\nIt was only Monday that the Zumwalt, the largest destroyer ever built for the Navy, headed out to sea for the first time.\n\nCoast Guard officials reported receiving a distress call at about 3 a.m., saying the 46-year-old captain of the fishing boat Danny Boy was suffering chest pains about 40 miles southeast of Portland.\n\nThe Zumwalt was conducting sea trials in the area and responded to the scene, the Portland Press Herald reported.\n\nA Coast Guard Jayhawk helicopter had responded from Air Station Cape Cod but the crew determined a hoist of the stricken fisherman would be too dangerous due to the configuration of the fishing boat's deck.\n\nOfficials said a crew and small boat from the Zumwalt transferred the man to the destroyer's deck. The helicopter crew then hoisted the patient and transported him to shore, where he was taken to Maine Medical Center for care.\n\n\"Our main concern with this type of medical emergency is to recover the patient safely and transport them to a higher level care as quickly as possible,\u201d said Lt. David Bourbeau, public affairs officer at Sector Northern New England. \u201cFortunately the Zumwalt was operating in the area and was able to provide valuable assistance.\u201d\n\nTwo days ago the Press Herald reported that the Zumwalt caught Maine\u2019s largest city by surprise when it emerged from the fog just off Cape Elizabeth and slipped unannounced into Portland Harbor.\n\nThe 610-foot ship is the first of a new class of high-tech destroyers, the paper reported. Its deckhouse is entirely enclosed atop the angular ship, which sits low in the water, like the iron-hulled steamship the USS Monitor, the first ironclad warship commissioned by the Union Navy.\n\nOn radar, the ship looks more like a small fishing boat than a 600-foot warship.\n\nThe ship has electric propulsion, new radar and sonar, powerful missiles and guns, and a stealthy design to reduce its radar signature. Advanced automation will allow the warship to operate with a much smaller crew size than current destroyers.\n\nAll of that innovation has led to construction delays and a growing price tag.\n\nAfter departing from shipbuilder Bath Iron Works, the vessel had to carefully navigate the winding Kennebec River before reaching the open ocean.\n\nMore than 200 shipbuilders, sailors and residents gathered to watch as the futuristic 15,000-ton ship glided past Fort Popham, accompanied by tugboats.\n\nBath Iron Works will be testing the ship's performance and making tweaks this winter. The goal is to deliver it to the Navy sometime next year.\n\nThe Associated Press contribute to this report.",

    "text": "Nov. 5, 2013: Virginia Democrat gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe and his wife Dorothy depart after voting at Spring Hill Elementary School in McLean, Virginia .reuters\n\nDemocrat Terry McAuliffe won the Virginia governor\u2019s race on Tuesday, in a surprisingly close victory over Republican rival Ken Cuccinelli -- who was heavily outspent and trailed in the polls for much of the race.\n\nWith nearly all precincts reporting, McAuliffe was ahead with just 48 percent of the vote, to Cuccinelli\u2019s 45 percent. Though McAuliffe previously held a double-digit lead, exit polls showed voters opposed to the federal health care law overwhelmingly backed Cuccinelli, helping him narrow the gap on Tuesday.\n\n\"Despite being outspent by an unprecedented $15 million, this race came down to the wire because of ObamaCare,\" Cuccinelli said in his concession speech. \"That message will go out to the entire country tonight.\"\n\n\"I know this has been a hard fought race,\" said McAuliffe in a victory speech that included a call for bipartisanship. \"While the attorney general and I had a lot of differences, he is a principled man who spent a lot of time away from his family. I thank Ken Cuccinelli for his service to Virginia.\"\n\nMcAuliffe vowed to reach out to state Republican lawmakers and continue the efforts of outgoing GOP Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and previous governors to create jobs and improve transportation\n\nMcAuliffe -- the prolific Clinton family fundraiser and former Democratic National Committee chairman \u2013 brought the firepower of his party establishment connections to the closely watched race. He hauled in $34.4 million in campaign contributions, roughly $14 million more than Cuccinelli, including $8.1 million in the final month.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s victory could have ramifications in the 2016 presidential race, especially if Hillary Clinton runs, because it gives her an influential ally in a key swing state.\n\nBut whether it serves as a bellwether for Democrats\u2019 popularity in 2014 remains unclear. That McAuliffe\u2019s lead narrowed in the final days -- due in part, it appears, to voters\u2019 early dissatisfaction with ObamaCare -- could throw a scare into some Democrats up for re-election in red states in 2014.\n\nMcAuliffe called upon the Clintons and President Obama to join him in Virginia in the closing weeks to help him close a campaign marked for its negative attacks, including ads that hammered Cuccinelli for his anti-abortion policies.\n\nMcAuliffe also got a boost from the partial government shutdown, which helped him open up a double-digit lead over Cuccinelli in public polling.\n\nHowever, Cuccinelli managed to narrow the margin in recent days as he sought the make the election a referendum on the botched rollout of ObamaCare.\n\n\"I'm scared to death about what ObamaCare is doing to Virginians, and Terry McAuliffe is scared to death what ObamaCare is doing to Terry McAuliffe,\u201d Cuccinelli, who has tried to make the election into a referendum on the law that McAuliffe supports, repeatedly said.\n\nMcAuliffe fared well among women voters and in the Washington, D.C., suburbs in Northern Virginia, according to early exit polls.\n\nLibertarian candidate Robert Sarvis was projected to finish a distant third, though he was garnering a fair amount of votes from young people.\n\n\u201cObamaCare has been a big part of why this race is a horse race at this point,\u201d Cuccinelli said after casting his vote Tuesday morning.\n\nCuccinelli, the state\u2019s attorney general, made several final-hour campaign stops in hopes his conservative supporters would give him a come-from-behind win.\n\nHe told reporters after voting in Northern Virginia that a strong GOP turnout would be \u201cabsolutely critical.\u201d\n\nTurnout was expected to be low -- 40 percent was the figure both sides were using. And both candidates were mustering their campaign organizations to find every last supporter. The negative tilt of the campaigns turned many voters off, and strategists in both parties predicted the outcome would be decided by just a few thousand votes.\n\nMcAuliffe, flush with cash, bombarded voters with a series of commercials that attempted to tie Cuccinelli to restricting abortions.\n\nCuccinelli also got help from marquee Republicans, including visits from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Sens. Marco Rubio, of Florida, and Rand Paul, of Kentucky -- all potential presidential contenders in 2016.\n\nThe 56-year-old McAuliffe succeeds term-limited Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, for a four-year term starting in January. He is now the state\u2019s 72nd governor.\n\nObama won the state in 2008 and 2012.\n\nRepublicans bet a deeply conservative candidate would be their best shot, passing over a lieutenant governor for Cuccinelli, an early crusader against ObamaCare.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "text": "At 8 a.m. every day, a collection of officials from the parish, the state, the National Guard, the Coast Guard and BP gather for a staff meeting. On a recent morning, the group sat, waiting, surrounded by television screens, a buffet counter of walkie-talkies and placards emblazoned with serious-looking acronyms that hang from the ceiling over a long conference table.\n\nThey were waiting for Billy Nungesser. When he marched in, he had already been up for hours, as usual, appearing on the morning TV news shows. He sat down and yanked an eyedropper out of a paper bag \u2014 a bug had flown into his eye during an interview with Anderson Cooper of CNN. He squeezed out some drops, then got down to business.\n\nMr. Nungesser, a native Louisianan, is president of Plaquemines Parish, an elongated rural jurisdiction that runs southeast from New Orleans and escorts the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWithin hours of the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, Mr. Nungesser, 51, became a go-to guy for the news media. In the ensuing weeks, he has turned into the angry everyman of the oil spill, whether delivering a broadside against the government and BP\u2019s response efforts on CNN or standing in the gymnasium of Boothville-Venice Elementary School (Home of the Oilers!) before an anxious crowd of shrimpers and fishermen.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s going to be rough,\u201d he said to the crowd in a speech that sounded at times like a locker room pep talk. \u201cI know everything\u2019s not going to go our way. But they\u2019re not going to beat us.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo get \u2019em, Billy,\u201d someone shouted from the bleachers.\n\nTo hear Mr. Nungesser tell it, the big boys \u2014 BP, the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers \u2014 have all been better at pointing fingers than solving problems.\n\nAlong with Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Mr. Nungesser has been a dogged advocate for a plan to build barrier islands out of dredged material to keep the oil off the shores.\n\nThere are a number of experts, including the Army Corps of Engineers, who think this is a bad idea, citing cost, time and environmental impact. In Mr. Nungesser\u2019s gospel, that kind of response, even if it turns out to be true, is only half an answer. Come up with a better idea, he tells critics, or keep your reservations to yourself.\n\n\u201cThese guys have no clue and no ability to think outside the box,\u201d he said at the morning staff meeting.\n\nDespite an affinity for the spotlight, Mr. Nungesser is a hard man to pin down. Between a cellphone that buzzes like an angry wasp, an unending string of interview requests, a visit by the president and the actual work of managing the parish, it is nearly impossible to slow him down long enough to confirm some basic biographical facts.\n\nFor example: How did Mr. Nungesser come to own an elk ranch in the parish?\n\nThe elk, he said late Thursday night over a 10-minute dinner of Sun Chips and soda, were bought from a man in Nebraska with the money he got from selling his house to his sister when he went to live in a shipping container.\n\nMr. Nungesser throws out sentences like that, and before one has a chance to ask him to elaborate, he is back on the phone, talking to a state trooper or a parish official or his fianc\u00e9e, who needs to know that a television camera crew was following him home that night.\n\nBack to the shipping container.\n\n\u201cI had a Jacuzzi,\u201d he clarified. \u201cIt was nice.\u201d\n\nIn his 20s and early 30s, Mr. Nungesser worked for his father\u2019s business, a catering company that served offshore drilling rigs. In 1991, before he got involved with the elk (he sells the velvet off the antlers for arthritis medicine), Mr. Nungesser realized that metal shipping containers could be modified and used as living quarters for workers on offshore rigs.\n\nHe had a hard time at first selling the idea to investors, mainly friends and friends of friends, and so he moved into a container himself. The company, General Marine Leasing, eventually reached $20 million in sales, and now, instead of a shipping container, he lives on a palatial estate built on a man-made hill in front of an artificial lake.\n\nMr. Nungesser rode out Hurricane Katrina on this estate and decided to run for parish president as a Republican in 2006, he said, out of frustration over the local response to the recovery.\n\nIt was a big decision. A run for state representative in his early 20s had left him cynical about politics, despite his pedigree: his father was the chairman of the State Republican Party when there was not much of one to speak of, and he was the chief of staff for Gov. David C. Treen, the state\u2019s first Republican governor since Reconstruction, in the early 1980s.\n\nMr. Nungesser\u2019s preparations for public office had come from running a business, an experience that made him good at laying into uncooperative oil companies but not always agile when it came to the give and take of a democracy.\n\n\u201cIn private business, Billy was, in essence, the chief cook and bottle washer,\u201d said Anthony Buras, a member of the parish council. \u201cIn the private business mentality, you move forward the minute you make a decision. Sometimes in government that isn\u2019t always doable. There have been some times where there\u2019s been some conflict with that.\u201d\n\nMr. Nungesser\u2019s impatience with the parish council is not something he takes pains to hide, railing against \u201cthe egos and the jealousy\u201d of his political opponents with the same irritation he displays when criticizing the response to the oil spill.\n\nThat is the mode he seems to enjoy most, and one he was fully engaged in late Thursday night on the front porch of the Myrtle Grove Marina.\n\nHe had just taken a regiment of journalists out in boats to see oiled pelicans, and now, his clothes drenched from a sudden downpour, he was balancing a flurry of phone calls with the demands of the news media.\n\nStanding in white shrimp boots that he called his Cajun Reeboks, he kept up the phone conversation while hooking up his microphone for a CNN interview like a seasoned correspondent.\n\nThen there was a moment of quiet as the cameraman counted down to the broadcast, a calmness that was striking. Mr. Nungesser was still for a full minute.\n\nThen he heard something in his earpiece, and he began telling Mr. Cooper why things just were not working right.",

An exhibition is also being staged at Shandy Hall, Sterne's former home in the North Yorkshire village of Coxwold.\n\n\"Sterne's marbled page is pretty clever and the 169 contributors have produced some wonderful interpretations of the meaning of the 'emblem of my work',\" said Patrick Wildgust, curator of the show and of Shandy Hall. \"There are a number of practising marblers whose work is included too.\"\n\nWriters Frank Cottrell Boyce, Iain Sinclair, Jonathan Meades and Graham Swift and poets Lavinia Greenlaw and Craig Raine have also contributed unattributed pieces. \"Hopefully people will bid because they like the work they see before them and not because it is directly associated with a particular name. Keeping the identity of the maker hidden makes it into more of a game \u2013 and one that everyone can enjoy,\" explained Wildgust.\n\nThe original marbled page was hand-produced, so unique to each volume. This, Wildgust believes, was the point. Sterne was underlining the element of chance in his story and in life: \"Things very rarely turn out as we plan so it is often best to just let things develop naturally. The true Shandean way.\"\n\n\"Motley\" was the term traditionally used to describe the outfits worn by court jesters and students of Sterne link the marbled page to the author's fictional alter ego, Yorick, also the name of the jester in Hamlet. Earlier in Tristram Shandy Sterne had pulled off another literary stunt by printing an entirely black page to mark the death of Yorick, prefaced by the Shakespearean quote, \"Alas! Poor Yorick\".\n\nIn Volume III Sterne's narrator says, \"You will no more be able to penetrate the moral of the next marbled page (motly emblem of my work!) than the world with all its sagacity has been able to unravel the many opinions, transactions and truths which still lie mystically hid under the dark veil of the black one.\"\n\nIn 2009 Shandy Hall invited artists to donate black pages to help the trust find matching funding to repair the lead valleys in the building's roof. Sterne wrote some of Tristram Shandy and his later work, A Sentimental Journey, while he lived there. \"The fact that Sterne wrote Tristram Shandy over a number of years means that different aspects of the book can provide stimulus for new work,\" said Wildgust.\n\nModern editions of the novel have identical printed marbled pages, usually in black and white, so the impact of the multi-coloured marbling is lost.\n\nWildgust does not have funding yet for a catalogue of the show \u2013 anyone who successfully bids for a work at auction will be told who created it. The money raised will go towards weatherproofing the gallery's roof.\n\nPlace your bid by telephone (01347 868465), by email (shandyhall@dsl.pipex.com), or in person at the gallery in Coxwold. Bids start at \u00a350, with a second bid at \u00a375, a third at \u00a3100 and a fourth bid at \u00a3150. Subsequent bids must rise in \u00a350 increments.",

The company also saw a 1.4% boost Tuesday on the Tokyo markets where it\u2019s primarily traded, but the news came after markets closed there.\n\nThe Nintendo NTDOY announcement was an unexpected departure from its past refusal to make titles for iPhones and other similar devices. The company is working with Japanese mobile game developer DeNA on the project, Fortune reported earlier:\n\nNintendo President Satoru Iwata told reporters that the alliance \u201cwill allow us to build a bridge between smart devices and gaming consoles.\u201d\n\nIwata had consistently refused to acknowledge a trend that has been undeniable for most industry observers in recent years. While online gaming through smartphones and other mobile devices has exploded, demand for console-based games has withered. Nintendo recorded three straight years of operating losses before its last fiscal year and delivered another profit warning in January after a near 40% year-on-year drop in sales of its 3DS console.\n\nThe deal doesn\u2019t mean every game in Nintendo\u2019s arsenal will immediately become available for iPhone or Android. But all of Nintendo\u2019s intellectual property from Mario to Donkey Kong is on the table.\n\nThe move could be a major step for Nintendo, whose Wii U console has consistently come in third behind Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One and Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4. The company has also seen its stock fall 80% since 2007, as Fortune wrote earlier.\n\nMoving into mobile gaming seems to be an acknowledgement that if gamers aren\u2019t coming to Nintendo, it has to meet them where they are \u2014 on their phones. The NDP Group found that people spent around 3 hours a day playing games on smartphones and tablets in 2014, up from 2 hours, 20 minutes two years earlier. Mobile gaming is currently a $25 billion market.",

    "text": "In a little over five years, Tokyo will host the world\u2019s greatest athletes for the first time in half a century. But before a single foundation stone has been laid, the Japanese capital, host of the 2020 Olympics, has become the arena for a verbal duel over what will be, or should be, the Games\u2019 defining monument.\n\nThe celebrations that greeted the city\u2019s selection as host almost two years ago \u2013 it last hosted the summer Olympics in 1964 \u2013 have given way to public bickering over the size and design of the event\u2019s showpiece: the sleek, futuristic main stadium designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid.\n\nFar from embracing her blueprint, some of Hadid\u2019s fellow architects have denounced the 80,000-seat structure as a monstrosity that stands out only because of its incongruity with its surroundings.\n\nThe most withering criticism has come from the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, who designed the Palau Sant Jordi used in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. In a long open letter sent to the Japan Sports Council (JSC) in November, the 83-year-old said Hadid\u2019s design looked like \u201ca turtle waiting for Japan to sink so that it can swim away\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe sight left me in despair,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf the stadium gets built the way it is, Tokyo will surely be burdened with a gigantic white elephant.\u201d\n\nIsozaki\u2019s reproof came after Japanese officials said they would scale back the building\u2019s size, bowing to growing criticism that it was too big and costly. The venue will now be 70 metres (230 feet) in height, five metres lower than envisaged, and will cost about $1.7bn, compared with the previous estimate of $3bn.\n\nUnfortunately for Hadid, a Pritzker prizewinner, Japan\u2019s modern history has played into the hands of her detractors. The 1964 Games coincided with the start of Japan\u2019s economic miracle and heralded its acceptance as a member of the international community after the country\u2019s disastrous military adventures in Asia. Half a century on, the 2020 organisers are struggling to find a unifying theme and the absence of a grand vision makes Hadid\u2019s stadium an easy target.\n\nThe stadium\u2019s size and location, rather than its cost, is what really riles many Tokyoites. It will be in the outer garden of the Meiji shrine, built in the early 1900s to honour the emperor of that name. The structure will dwarf nearby buildings, including the Meiji Memorial Picture Gallery, an officially recognised cultural asset built in 1926 to honour the emperor and empress dowager Shoken.\n\nFor all its energy and charm, Tokyo is in most parts a sprawling collection of modern buildings that are at best aesthetically challenged and, in many cases, downright ugly.\n\nThe new stadium, critics say, will deprive the city\u2019s people of one of the few remaining green spaces in an area of historical value.\n\nBuilding the stadium in such an important historical setting would also insult the memory of those who donated money to buy the land after the emperor\u2019s death in 1912, said Nobuko Shimizu, co-chairwoman of the pressure group Custodians of the National Stadium.\n\n\u201cThe present national stadium is still usable, with renovations, while the new one will cause huge damage to the environment and landscape of the Jingu outer garden, which is an oasis for Tokyo residents,\u201d said Shimizu.\n\nShe conceded that the national stadium in its current form would not offer much comfort to spectators, but noted that successful refurbishments had been made to the Olympiastadion in Berlin, host of the 1936 Games, and to the Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, Olympic host in 1932 and 1984.\n\nThere are mounting calls for the JSC, which is overseeing construction, to scrap Hadid\u2019s design and instead refurbish the 54,000-seat national stadium, which hosted athletics and the football final at the 1964 Olympics.\n\nRising costs have already forced Tokyo\u2019s governor, Yoichi Masuzoe, to scrap three new venues \u2013 for basketball, badminton and sailing \u2013 but officials say that a similar fate does not await Hadid\u2019s stadium.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that there are various opinions, but we would like to implement the current plan for building a world-class stadium,\u201d said Tomoko Mashimo, a spokeswoman for the JSC, which is responsible for the stadium project.\n\n\u201cWe do not think the design will damage the landscape of the stadium\u2019s surroundings,\u201d Mashimo added.\n\nEnvironmental concerns aside, campaigners say that replacing the existing stadium with Hadid\u2019s behemoth will mean evicting 300 households from the nearby Kasumigaoka apartments, as well as a handful of homeless men who sleep in the park. Campaigners accuse the Tokyo metropolitan government, which has arranged new accommodation for the residents, of threatening to destroy a long-established community.\n\n\u201cLots of elderly people live in the apartment blocks, and the stress of moving to a new place will be too much for them,\u201d said Tetsuo Ogawa, a member of pressure group People Against the Olympics. \u201cThere is a real sense of community where they are now, but that will be destroyed when they move out.\u201d\n\nSatoshi Ohashi, a senior associate at Zaha Hadid Architects, defended the stadium\u2019s design. \u201cWe have been developing the design in various stages and optimising the design and responding to various requirements,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs architects we\u2019re often in this situation. When something is very public and attention gathering, you always have people with criticisms, and in this case there\u2019s been criticism that has maybe clouded the process. But what is important is that as design architects we take this project though from beginning to end, and we\u2019re capable of doing that.\u201d\n\nAs contractors prepare to demolish the national stadium, already shorn of its seats, later this month, a major rethink of the stadium plans is unlikely. In the aftermath of Isozaki\u2019s letter, however, it is still open season on its controversial replacement.\n\nThe Japan Times said the structure would \u201cdrastically alter the landscape in an abhorrent manner\u201d. The paper noted that building regulations had been altered to accommodate the 70-metre stadium, even though other buildings in the area must not exceed 20 metres.\n\n\u201cThe stadium\u2019s supporters do not have the right to leave the nation with a legacy that will be a blight on Japan\u2019s first officially designated scenic area,\u201d it said in a recent editorial. \u201cThe design should be reviewed and downsized in a manner that addresses financial, safety and aesthetic concerns.\u201d\n\nWith demolition work imminent, campaigners are seeking a compromise that would allow two of the 10 ageing apartment blocks to remain for residents who want to stay.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of talk about how much good the Olympics will do Tokyo, but the only people who will really benefit are the big Japanese construction companies,\u201d said Ogawa. \u201cTo go through all this trouble for an event that lasts only two weeks is clearly wrong.\u201d",

    "text": "Georgia mayor grapples with new law\n\nUvalda, Georgia (CNN) -- Paul Bridges leans toward his desk, picks up the phone and punches in a number with the fast, laser focus of a man on a mission. The mayor of this tiny town in South Georgia is ready for battle -- and looking for a new weapon.\n\n\"I need some help getting a website,\" he said, spelling out the words of the domain name he wants for a site promoting immigration reform.\n\nThe man on the other end says he'll try to help. But that isn't enough for Bridges.\n\n\"I really don't know what your beliefs are on this issue,\" he said, \"but I'm going to persuade you.\"\n\nBridges wants the federal government to come up with a solution that gives the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States a chance to work here legally.\n\n\"You get me an invite to that Tea Party meeting and I'm going ... I'd like to give the contrary viewpoints. Surely one person in the audience is going to be sympathetic.\"\n\nBridges is an unlikely soldier on the front lines of the nation's immigration debate. The 58-year-old native Southerner describes himself as a conservative Republican. For years, he knew little about immigrants but didn't lack strong opinions about them: \"They were just low-class people,\" he recalled. \"They weren't even able to speak English.\"\n\nBridges' English is laced with a folksy drawl; he tosses out phrases such as \"heck no\" and \"that just flew all over me.\" But he can switch into the singsongy Spanish of a Mexican farmworker. And he counts immigrants among his closest friends.\n\nBridges is one of more than a dozen plaintiffs suing Georgia and its governor, trying to stop the state's new immigration law. They won a reprieve Monday when a federal judge temporarily blocked parts of the law scheduled to go into effect July 1.\n\nJudge blocks key parts of Georgia immigration law\n\nOne of those sections would criminalize exactly what the mayor of Uvalda does almost every day: knowingly driving a car with illegal immigrants as passengers. The judge also put on hold parts of the law that allow police to ask about immigration status during investigations of criminal violations.\n\nBut the legal fight is far from over. It could drag on for months and reach the chambers of the nation's highest court. It's a struggle that pits Bridges against many members of his own party and could hurt his political future. But that doesn't stop the mayor.\n\nCommon thread present in challenges to immigration law\n\nIn public speeches and opinion articles, he slams state lawmakers for creating an unfunded mandate that he says will burden police and devastate farmers who depend on immigrant labor in their onion fields and berry groves.\n\nBridges: Why I'm suing Georgia over immigration law\n\nHis words are more than just political talking points. The potentially crippling economic blow to the region is only one part of his rallying cry.\n\nBridges is waging a deeply personal battle.\n\nEnforcement of the Georgia law could put him in prison and tear apart the families of some of his closest friends.\n\nIn his City Hall office, just a few feet away from a handbook for Georgia mayors and council members, he keeps a glass paperweight engraved with a Bible verse.\n\nA family of illegal immigrants gave it to him for Christmas.\n\n'I decided I was going to be the mayor for everybody'\n\nBridges is used to facing a tough crowd.\n\nCritics called him an \"outsider\" two years ago when he decided to run for mayor of Uvalda, a one-stoplight town surrounded by onion fields and pine forests. Never mind that he grew up only 26 miles away. In Uvalda, population 600, everyone knows everyone.\n\nHis opponent's family had ties to the town that went back generations -- in fact, you might say Martin Moses was undefeatable in the category of name recognition: His kin founded Uvalda, and his grandfather once was its mayor.\n\nBut Bridges met the challenge by knocking on every door in town, asking residents to share their concerns and telling them he wanted the top job.\n\nUvalda, population 600, is a one-stoplight town surrounded by onion fields and the pine forests of South Georgia.\n\nThese days, he seems to know everyone who lives inside Uvalda's 1.9 square miles. His cell phone rings when their cable goes out, when their water bills go up or when they've locked their keys inside their cars.\n\nIt takes about two minutes to drive from one side of Uvalda to the other. A little more if you stop for watermelons and peaches at the farm stands set up on the corner by the town's single, blinking-red stoplight. Mostly, people pass through Uvalda on their way to somewhere else. But Bridges is planning to stay.\n\nAnd given the chance, he believes he can sway the staunchest supporters of the state's immigration law -- just as he won Uvalda over, one person at a time.\n\nThe law, known as House Bill 87, gained steam quickly in the halls of Georgia's Capitol. Its backers argued that illegal immigrants were sucking away state resources, and that the U.S. government wasn't doing enough to enforce existing laws.\n\n\"This legislation is a responsible step forward in the absence of federal action. Illegal immigration places an incredible burden on Georgia taxpayers,\" Gov. Nathan Deal said after signing the bill last month.\n\nBridges says Deal is \"fanning anti-immigrant sentiment without facts.\"\n\n\"The immigrant community is a big part of the economy of Georgia,\" he says. \"These people earn money and pay taxes just like the rest of us.\"\n\nOn a white board in his office at City Hall, Bridges has the kind of lengthy to-do list one would expect of a small-town mayor. He's collecting back taxes and trying to convince people to open businesses in the city's dilapidated downtown.\n\nBut he sees his responsibility -- to serve the town's \"citizens\" -- a little differently than most mayors. For him, that term has nothing to do with passports or residency papers.\n\n\"When I became mayor, I decided I was going to be the mayor for everybody, including people who have no voice otherwise.\"\n\nImmigrants are no longer strangers\n\nBridges knew immigrants were a growing labor force on South Georgia's farms, but he never heard or saw them.\n\nThat changed one afternoon in 1999 when he was looking for lasagna ingredients at a Soperton grocery store.\n\nA brown-skinned couple caught his eye. From the way they leaned toward each other, he knew they were deeply in love. Words tumbled from their mouths -- a series of sounds without meaning for Bridges. He listened anyway, wishing he could understand.\n\nHe spotted them walking outside the store, plastic grocery bags in hand. \"Do ya'll wanna lift?\" he asked. They looked at him quizzically, so he tried again, \"Do ya'll wanna ride?\"\n\nThe couple and another man piled into his car, pointing the way to their destination a few miles away: two rundown trailers in the middle of a cotton field. Bridges dropped them off and went home to make dinner.\n\nBut he couldn't get what he'd seen out of his mind. Nearly 30 people lived in the two trailers.\n\nA few hours later, Bridges went back to the cotton field, carrying lasagna and his daughter's Spanish-English dictionary. It was the beginning of a whirlwind journey into a new world that would change his life.\n\nPeople he had never noticed embraced him. They taught him new words, served him soup and showed him the pictures of their children taped to the trailer's walls.\n\n\"It made me realize that I need to take another look at myself. ... It really brought out the 'me' in me,\" he said.\n\nHe spent New Year's Eve that year with a family in Mexico. When he returned to Georgia, he started teaching English as a Second Language classes to immigrants. He introduced himself to his students as \"Pablo Puentes,\" a literal, Spanish translation of his name.\n\nSome people didn't understand his transformation. When Bridges first introduced an immigrant friend to his family, his brother-in-law turned around and walked away.\n\nBridges refused to close his social circle.\n\n\"I thought, 'Well, he just doesn't know him,' \" he said.\n\nImmigrants had been strangers in his eyes, too. Then many of those strangers became friends. And eventually, they became family.\n\nPanic about new law as rumors spread On a Friday afternoon at the height of onion season, workers stream into a South Georgia convenience store, eager to cash their paychecks from a week's work in the nearby fields.\n\nThe smell of fresh fruit and the sound of Spanish small talk fill the air.\n\nBridges greets customers from behind the counter, his words punctuated by the cash register's steady ring.\n\n\"Buenas tardes,\" he said. \"Pasenle.\" Come in.\n\nOccasionally tourists stop to snap a photo of this store in Santa Claus, Georgia, a tiny town near Uvalda founded in the 1940s by a farmer hoping to boost pecan sales. But store owner Chris Wiggins says the influx of immigrants has been a far greater boon for his business.\n\nHe operates the kind of gas station convenience store that only sold beer, potato chips and beef jerky a decade ago. Now limes, corn husks and dried chili peppers are part of the inventory. Calling cards behind the counter bear pictures of the Mexican flag.\n\n\"I arranged for him to get some tortillas,\" said Bridges, who volunteers at the store on Friday afternoons. It gives him a chance to practice different Spanish vocabulary, he says, and chat with friends.\n\n\"Gracias a usted,\" he told one customer after ringing up his purchases. \"Nada mas firma tu nombre abajo\" -- just sign your name below -- he tells a man waiting to cash a check.\n\nSome people make a point of stopping by when they hear he's working. They are old friends or former English students who know him as \"Don Pablo.\"\n\nBridges banters with them in Spanish as they make their way to the front of the line. When one man places a 12-pack of beer on the counter, Bridges tells him that he wants half.\n\nBut as rumors spread about the immigration law, conversations at the store have taken on a more serious slant.\n\n\"They ask, 'Let us know what the law says,' \" Wiggins said. \"They don't really understand. ... We hear them panicking.\"\n\nGeorgia's agricultural economy will suffer as farmworkers go elsewhere, critics of the immigration law say.\n\nA lack of information about the new measure breeds rumors of immigration raids. Illegal parents with U.S.-born children debate whether to leave Georgia. Some migrant workers who normally pass through Georgia have decided to stay out of the state, preferring to pick crops in Michigan or North Carolina.\n\nBridges takes a break from behind the register to check out the situation at the onion farm next door.\n\nAbout 20 workers stand beside a conveyer belt on a warehouse assembly line, packing onions into bags for shipment. Staffing is short. Fewer migrant workers showed up this season as word of the law crossed state lines.\n\nBridges asks the men who run the operation what they think of the new law, and warns them that the consequences could be dire.\n\n\"If we don't stop it in Georgia, all the other states are going to follow suit,\" he said.\n\nWarehouse manager Ruben Arizmendi suggests creating a work permit system for workers already living in the country.\n\n\"Would you consider writing a letter to the editor of The Vidalia Advance?\" Bridges asked.\n\n\"If someone will type it up for me,\" Arizmendi said.\n\n'I think he ought to keep out of that business'\n\nOne e-mail called him an \"evil American.\" One labeled him a communist.\n\nAnother -- with the subject line of \"the real price of onions\" -- criticized him for driving illegal immigrants to doctors' offices, saying U.S. citizens were being forced to pay the medical bills of onion workers.\n\nAs word spread about the lawsuit, messages from people Bridges has never met started appearing in his inbox at City Hall. But critics of the mayor's involvement in the suit can be found on the streets of Uvalda as well.\n\n\"I knew somebody was going to raise a fuss about it. I just didn't think it would be this local,\" said Leland Adams, who owns a hardware store a few blocks from Bridges' home on Main Street.\n\nImmigrants are good customers, he says, but they need to follow the law.\n\n\"I think he ought to keep out of that business, leave the law alone. I think everybody ought to be here legally and show their ID when they need to show it.\"\n\nBridges doesn't shy away from defending his views. One man asked what he would do if someone broke into his home, raping and killing a family member.\n\n\"I would like to know if you would want this person prosecuted to the full extent of the law. If you answer this question yes, why would you not want other people breaking our laws prosecuted?\" he wrote. \"Mr. Bridges, you can and must apply the laws of the land equally.\"\n\n\"Are you comfortable with a law that tells you who can or cannot visit you in your own home? One that tells you who can and cannot ride in your car? One that makes an otherwise law-abiding citizen a criminal?\"\n\nBridges has been trying to choose his words carefully ever since a woman from the Southern Poverty Law Center asked him to join the class-action lawsuit against Georgia's immigration law.\n\nHe is a divorced father of three, and the warnings of his friends and family weigh on him. Many tried to convince him not to get involved in the case, fearing it would draw too much attention. He worries that expressing what he believes may harm those he loves.\n\nAnd he knows his participation in the lawsuit could affect him politically if he chooses to run for mayor again in 2013.\n\nBut for Bridges, backing down is not an option.\n\nDespite the immigration law, he will continue shuttling immigrants to soccer games and shopping malls. He will still let his friend's undocumented family members stay in his home during berry-picking season. And he will keep fighting the law, even though none of the people he's fighting for can vote for him on election day.\n\n\"I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing,\" he says, \"because I can't run scared of something that is so basically and blatantly wrong.\"\n\nHelping friends is worth the risk\n\nBridges climbs into the driver's seat of his friend's van and revs up the engine for a Friday night shopping trip.\n\nA 5-year-old sitting in the back seat calls him \"Grandpa.\" She is the daughter of one of his closest friends -- a Mexican immigrant he first met outside the trailers in the cotton field in 1999.\n\nLike Bridges, the 5-year-old was born in the \"Sweet Onion City\" of Vidalia, Georgia. But her parents, brother and sister came to the United States illegally.\n\nBridges tries to drive them wherever they need to go. A broken taillight or a wrong turn could tear their family apart. If authorities stop them and find out they're in the United States illegally, they could be jailed or deported.\n\nUnder House Bill 87, Bridges could go to prison or face steep fines for driving them. But he says it's worth the risk.\n\nThey are his family, too.\n\nTogether, they stop at several stores, ending the night at Wal-Mart, where the family plans to find a gift for a wedding the next day.\n\nBridges runs into someone he knows in almost every aisle. And he mentions the immigration law every chance he gets.\n\nOne man he meets -- a citizen who just married an undocumented immigrant -- says he learned about the law a few days before when he picked up a Spanish-language newspaper at a local restaurant. Now he can't stop thinking about how a simple trip to buy groceries could ruin the life he and his wife are building together.\n\n\"I can't sleep. I don't know what I'm going to do. She gets deported, and I go to jail, for what? For going to Wal-Mart and getting some milk?\"\n\nBridges tells him he should call his local lawmakers -- before it's too late.\n\nThe man shrugged and said, \"What is a 22-year-old Hispanic man gonna do?\"\n\nHe says he's been stopped more times than he can remember by a police officer in a nearby town who repeats the same refrain: \"You have that dark-haired, dark-skinned complexion. I assume you don't have a license.\"\n\nBridges implores him to speak out.\n\n\"You might be that last drop,\" he said. \"You might be the one that does it. I can't stress to you enough how important it is.\"\n\nThe man shrugged again. \"What do I tell them?\" he asked. \"Help?\"\n\nBridges shakes his head. He believes minds can be changed, just as his was.\n\n\"Just tell them, 'I want you to hear me out. I'm a real person. Listen to me.' \"\n\nUvalda Mayor Paul Bridges calls the tough immigration law \"unconscionable\" and \"un-Christian.\"\n\nFight now in court's hands Bridges sits on a wood bench in the front row of a courtroom in Atlanta, clutching a notebook. The atmosphere is tense, quiet. He is nauseous and alone.\n\nFriends are waiting in a van in a nearby parking deck. The family has lived in Georgia for more than a decade, but now they are afraid to walk outside.\n\nBridges is fighting for them, and for countless other friends and former students. His decision to be \"the mayor for everybody\" led him here.\n\nThe family is willing to sit for hours in the heat so he can drive them to a shopping mall after the hearing. Uncertain how the law will affect them, they have canceled plans for the 14-year-old's coming-of-age quincea\u00f1era party in case they have to leave the country. They hope to get their deposit back on a dress.\n\n\"All rise. Court is now in session,\" the bailiff said.\n\nOmar Jadwat, an attorney from the American Civil Liberties Union, mentions Bridges in his opening argument, describing him as \"Mayor Bridges, who on occasion helps undocumented friends come from Florida to Georgia.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash Jr. grills the attorney representing the state.\n\nHe asks what would happen if police pulled over an 18-year-old citizen for speeding while he was on the way to the grocery store with his illegal immigrant mother.\n\nAs the judge speaks, Bridges nods so intensely that his whole body rocks back and forth. He is encouraged by the questioning. The judge seems to see what he does: a law that makes criminals out of good citizens and tears families apart.\n\nBut he grimaces at the attorney's answer.\n\n\"It would be no different than if his mother had pockets full of cocaine, and he was knowingly transporting her to go sell it,\" said Devon Orland, senior assistant attorney general for the state.\n\nThe judge does not make a decision on this day -- but promises to rule before July 1, when the law is scheduled to take effect.\n\nOutside, on the courthouse steps, Bridges is among a handful of plaintiffs who speak to reporters. After a morning spent on the sidelines, for a few minutes, he is leading the charge.\n\n\"This law has placed a target on the backs of these workers and their families,\" he said. \"It's un-American, it's unconscionable and it's also un-Christian.\"\n\nHis voice rises. \"It does not carry the values of my Republican Party.\"\n\nA few onlookers clap. Reporters swarm around him, peppering him with questions. But they lose interest as another plaintiff starts talking.\n\nBridges walks away from the courthouse alone.\n\nHe is a small man swimming in a sea of unfamiliar skyscrapers. The vast, flat fields of South Georgia are hundreds of miles away. His face is flushed. His eyes wet. He wipes his hand across his forehead.\n\n\"It's just more emotional than I can explain,\" he said.\n\nAs he rounds the corner into a parking deck, the 5-year-old who calls him Grandpa bounds toward him and throws her arms around his legs. He kisses her on the head.\n\n\"It's over, my princess. I've done it,\" he said.\n\nShe looks up at him with a satisfied grin. But her older sister, who was born in Mexico and has spent most of her life in America, looks anxious.\n\nThis is the 14-year-old whose quincea\u00f1era party has been canceled. She is terrified that the law will force her family to return to a country she barely remembers.\n\nThe judge didn't decide, Bridges explains, but he did ask a lot of questions.\n\nThe many faces of immigration in America\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Bridges couldn't stop grinning. The judge's ruling was a glimmer of hope that the judicial system he believes in can deliver justice.\n\nBut he has already begun preparing for the next round of battle. The state is appealing the ruling, and eventually, both sides will return to the courtroom to present their arguments in the case.\n\nAt a future hearing, Bridges says he hopes he'll have a chance to testify.\n\nWhen he got the news Monday, he called the Mexican immigrant who has become one of his closest friends -- the man his brother-in-law once spurned but is now a welcome guest at Bridges' family reunions.\n\nThe worst parts of the law have been stopped, for now, he told him.\n\nThen, he called his priest, who said the judge's decision was an answer to his prayers.\n\nA few minutes later, Bridges' cell phone rang. His friend's 14-year-old daughter wanted to know more about the ruling.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" she asked.\n\nTo anyone who will listen, the mayor of Uvalda will say this: The girl with the anxious question is one of the many faces of immigration in America, someone whom supporters of laws such as HB 87 do not notice, but need to see.\n\nShe is a straight-A student whose parents are working hard to give her a better life.\n\nShe knows America as her country.\n\nAnd like any teenager, she does not want to leave friends, teachers and a school she loves behind.\n\nOn Monday, she asked the mayor for the exact wording she should use to describe the judge's ruling.\n\nShe wanted to post the news on Facebook.",

    "text": "Mr. Kelley says it wasn't his goal to become one of the country's biggest landowners. 'I grew up on a farm and that's about as good an explanation as there is,' he said in an interview. 'Land is something I know. It's something I have an affinity for. It becomes part of your DNA.'\n\nHe's from Kentucky, makes his own bourbon, drives a Ford pickup\u2014and flies in a private plane.\n\nNancy Keates on Lunch Break introduces us to the unlikely fourth-largest landowner in the U.S., a reclusive and eccentric gentleman who owns 1.7 million acres of land in Florida, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nReclusive billionaire Brad Kelley is hardly ever photographed. He doesn't use email. And he owns more land than the state of Rhode Island.\n\nThese are some of the few details that have emerged about Brad Kelley, 55, a deeply private billionaire who made his fortune in the discount cigarette business. Mr. Kelley, whose hobbies include breeding rare, exotic animals, very rarely gives interviews. He doesn't tweet or use email.\n\nHe is also one of the largest private landowners in the country, spending by his own account hundreds of millions of dollars on about a million acres\u2014or about 1,600 square miles. The state of Rhode Island, by comparison, has a land area of 1,215 square miles. According to the Land Report 100, which tracks land ownership, Mr. Kelley is the fourth-largest private landowner by acres in the U.S., just behind Liberty Media Chairman John Malone, media mogul Ted Turner and the Emmerson family, headed by timber magnate Archie Aldis Emmerson.\n\nMr. Kelley says it wasn't his goal to become one of the country's biggest landowners. \"I grew up on a farm and that's about as good an explanation as there is,\" he says in an interview. \"Land is something I know. It's something I have an affinity for. It becomes part of your DNA.\"\n\nIt has also become an increasingly popular investment in uncertain financial times. Some investors see land as a hedge against inflation, and low global interest rates have made land cheaper to buy. Higher world food prices and an anticipation of a recovery in the housing market have bankers pitching land as one of the few places to get real returns on an asset whose underlying value continues to rise. \"It's a nonperishable commodity and it's as good a place as any to put my money,\" Mr. Kelley says. \"It's better than derivatives.\"\n\nDennis Moon, head of the Specialty Asset Management team at U.S. Trust, the private-banking division of Bank of America, says land appeals to people as an investment they can easily understand. His clients have more than doubled their direct investments in irrigated farmland\u2014land that produces crops like corn, soybean and wheat\u2014over the past year to about $175 million, earning a net yield of some 4% a year. Others are more cautious, warning that the high rate of growth could mean the market is in a bubble, the risks being volatility in agricultural commodity prices, farmland values and farm production costs.\n\nRanches, which are Mr. Kelley's specialty, don't tend to yield much of an annual return. Instead, their value is in the underlying appreciation of the land: According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the national average value of U.S. ranchland rose 12% compared with five years earlier; in Texas, it is up 30% compared with five years ago. Investors make cash on ranches when they are subdivided and sold to developers or as \"trophy ranches,\" where the wealthy can fish and hunt.\n\nThe properties of Brad Kelley include Iron Mountain Ranch, shown here, about 30,000 acres northwest of Marathon, Texas.\n\nTexas oil baron T. Boone Pickens describes his strategy with ranches as \"simple: Change the use of the land.\" He recently joined six other investors in a new ranch fund called Sporting Ranch Capital. The plan, says the fund's manager Jay Ellis, is to buy 12 to 15 premier ranches in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Oregon and Idaho, fix them up and then resell them as \"trophy sporting ranches.\" In August, the fund made its first purchase\u2014a 760-acre ranch in Colorado with a 2.6-mile fishing stream and five lakes\u2014for about $6 million in cash; the fund hopes to put it back on the market in 2014 for over $10 million.\n\nMr. Turner first got into buying ranches in 1987 for the fly fishing and stress relief. \"I fell in love with the West; the wide-open spaces, the wildlife and beautiful landscapes. I knew immediately that I wanted more land\u2014and lots of it,\" he says in an email. But he also tries to make his ranch operations\u2014most often raising bison\u2014profitable. \"We always consider investment value in addition to opportunities for recreation and conservation when we look at property,\" he says.\n\nMr. Kelley's ranch strategy is different. He looks for good deals on cattle ranches in out-of-the-way places he thinks are undervalued, and holds on to them. He likes to buy adjoining parcels because it's more efficient to operate a ranch in large blocks and because it tends to be easier to buy property when it's right next door: He already knows what he's buying and what the seller is like. And he doesn't develop the land he buys: \"We don't try to inject our way of doing things on other folks,\" he says. In this way, he has pieced together existing cattle ranches in remote parts of Texas, Florida and New Mexico.\n\nOnce he has bought the land, Mr. Kelley does what some ranchers call \"resting.\" He keeps the cattle operations running, almost always leasing the land back to the previous owner, who already knows how to run the existing operation. Mr. Kelley says his operations break even. Several farmers and ranchers who work on land owned by Mr. Kelley didn't respond to requests for interviews.\n\nThe value of Mr. Kelley's land investments is difficult to calculate. \"When he started buying ranches here, we all thought he was crazy,\" says Johnny Carpenter, an Alpine, Texas, real-estate agent who sold Mr. Kelley about half a dozen ranches in West Texas over a five-year period. Since then, the value of the land Mr. Kelley owns in those areas, known to be scenic with views of mountains, has doubled, Mr. Carpenter says. Chip Cole, a ranch broker in San Angelo, Texas, who was involved in the sale of about 15 ranches to Mr. Kelley, says prices doubled in 2005 and 2006. In 2008, sales volume dried up, making estimating current values more difficult, though Mr. Cole suspects values have softened.\n\nFew things make Mr. Kelley bristle more than being called a land speculator. He argues that he has sold about 15% of his total holdings over the past three decades; combined with the land he has bought, that's an aggregate turnover of less than half a percent, most of it for management reasons. \"We take great pride in improving our property,\" he says, adding that he replaces and upgrades dozens of miles of fences annually and keeps water and wells running.\n\nPeople who have worked for Mr. Kelley recall him showing up at his ranches with groups of friends and family for occasional hunting and fishing weekends. At night, the group played cards and drank bourbon.\n\nBrad Kelley's Iron Mountain Ranch\n\nHomer Mills, who started working for Mr. Kelley in West Texas in 1999 and helped him manage the dozen or so ranches he bought over the next five years, describes Mr. Kelley as a \"good old boy from Kentucky.\" He recalls that Mr. Kelley sometimes wore a kilt (\"they're comfortable,\" says Mr. Kelley when asked), liked cooking (he made a \"mean cornbread,\" says Mr. Mills) and didn't hunt, though he did fish. At one point Mr. Kelley sported a long red beard, earning him the nickname \"ZZ Top.\"\n\nColorful eccentricities aside, Mr. Kelley is also a shrewd businessman who avoids the limelight. Much of Mr. Kelley's land is listed under LLCs with names like Spanish Trail Land & Cattle Co. and Texas Mountain Cattle Co. Brokers say they often deal with his business manager, an attorney named Greg Betterton, who works out of an office in Venice, Fla. \"You don't call Brad Kelley. He calls you. People all over the South try to get land in front of him. He's been one of the most effective people at flying below the radar in this space,\" says Joe Taggart, a managing director with LandVest, a real-estate and timberland-consulting firm based in Boston.\n\nMr. Kelley grew up in Franklin, Ky., near the Tennessee border, on a tobacco farm that also had livestock and a little grain. He always assumed he would become a farmer, he says. He bought his first piece of land\u2014a farm with cattle near his childhood house\u2014in 1974 when he was 17, shortly after graduating from high school. He dropped out of Western Kentucky University four times and never graduated.\n\nAs the tobacco industry shifted in the 1980s and the business of preliminary tobacco processing began to decline, there were a number of old warehouses around Kentucky that were no longer being used. Mr. Kelley got into the business of buying them and converting them for other uses, leasing them out to businesses like furniture and paper processing. One day, in the process of removing old equipment from a warehouse, Mr. Kelley came across some old cigarette-making equipment that still worked. He had wanted to get into manufacturing consumer products, so he seized the opportunity.\n\nHe started Commonwealth Brands, a small cigarette manufacturer based in Bowling Green, Ky., with discounted brands like USA Gold, Sonoma, Commonwealth, Country Value and a cigar called Brahman in 1991. He sold Commonwealth in 2001 to Houchens Industries, a Bowling Green, Ky.-based conglomerate, for about $1 billion.\n\nMr. Kelley doesn't smoke. \"I never defended it,\" he says of his old business. \"Hopefully it will be phased out of society.\"\n\nMr. Kelley began investing in land outside Kentucky in 1997. He was drawn to West Texas, where he says he now has about 850,000 acres, because prices were good and he found the land beautiful and out of the way, he says. Once he bought something, brokers started contacting him about buying more land.\n\nMr. Kelley's foray into Florida began in 1997 with the purchase of a house in Boca Grande for about $1 million. He sold that and bought his current three-bedroom, 5,923-square-foot house, also in Boca Grande, in 2000 for $5.5 million. He was looking for property to set up a place for his animal breeding operations\u2014a hobby that started with rare breeds of cattle, he says. That led to the acquisition in 2004 and 2005 of some 40,000 acres in De Soto County, in the western part of the state for a reported $50 million.\n\nMr. Kelley now has a breeding operation on some of that acreage, known as Rum Creek Ranch, that's dedicated to a range of endangered species including tapirs, anoas (small buffalos), hippos, rhinos, bongos (antelopes), bentang (wild cattle) and a host of others. He works with zoos and conservation groups, with the ultimate goal of reintroducing the animals back to their native habitat.\n\nHis primary home is in Franklin, Tenn., where he lives with his wife, Susan, and his three daughters. He bought his 8,176-square-foot house with a swimming pool and a tennis court on 26 acres in 2003 for $1.9 million.\n\nHe frequently travels to his different properties, he says.He owns about 60 properties in Simpson County, Ky., where he grew up, as well as land in New Mexico, Wyoming and Colorado.\n\nThough he is still buying large pieces of land\u2014mostly in Texas, where he purchased about 44,000 acres in adjoining cattle ranches over the summer, and Kentucky, where he bought the 800-acre Calumet Farm this spring\u2014land only represents about a quarter of his businesjs interests. He owns some land in Chile and has looked at Argentina, but says there were too many transactional hurdles there. His other business investments are in venture capital in companies that range from telecommunications to construction materials, beer and energy technology.\n\nMr. Kelley says he just takes opportunities as they come. \"There's never been a grand plan. Life takes you a lot of places. Every day you adjust your compass,\" he says.\n\nInvestors often turn to land as a hedge against inflation or as an alternative when other markets are volatile. Some economists warn that a land bubble could be building, however, especially in cropland, which has seen annual growth rates soar over the past seven years. Below, a look at three land markets.\n\nCropland: According to a USDA report published in August, the value of U.S. cropland increased 14.5% in 2012 compared with the prior year and has shown double-digit growth almost every year since 2005\u2014which has sparked some concerns about a bubble. The Specialty Asset Management team at U.S. Trust, the privatebanking division of Bank of America, says that given drought conditions and world-wide demand for food, it makes most sense to invest in irrigated land and to diversify by buying land that produces a range of crops.\n\nTimberland: Over the last 25 years, the annualized return on timberland properties has averaged 13% compared with a return of 9.2% for the Standard Poor's 500-stock index, according to a study published by the Hancock Natural Resource Group. The most expensive timberland is in the West, where bigger and fastergrowing trees mean a higher volume; Northeast timberland is more in reach for individual buyers.\n\nRanchland/Pastureland: Investment banks are currently shying away from looking at ranchland for profit: Banks say it's too difficult given the current drought that has sent livestock feed prices soaring. Still, the underlying value of the land has continued to increase: According to the USDA report, the average value of U.S. pasture rose to $1,150 per acre in 2012, a 4.5% increase over 2011.\n\nAllegany, N.Y., timberland, about 2,377 acres\n\nAllegany, N.Y., timberland, about 2,377 acres\n\nThe land has such species as red maple, white ash, sugar maple and black cherry. The seller also says there's a possibility the property could generate wind energy: a feasibility study has been completed and layout of potential turbines is available for review.

Yes!ALSO ONLINE: Follow BarbDeLollis on Twitter\n\nMost striking is the prominence of voices from social media sites outside of Four Seasons' control. For instance, if you're browsing one of the chain's 86 hotels such as the Four Seasons Los Angeles at Beverly Hills, you'll be able to see what people are saying about it on Facebook, Twitter and TripAdvisor.\n\nThe \"Reviews at a Glance\" box contains bright red letters that you can click on to go directly to TripAdvisor's site for a particular hotel, the hotel's Twitter account page or its Facebook account page.\n\nSharing all reviews: Risky move?\n\nFour Seasons marketing chief Susan Helstab, who last March during an interview at the Four Seasons London at Park Lane told me about the vision for the site, says sharing all reviews is a risk that luxury brands in particularly have been reluctant to take.\n\n\"You take your chance with the good and the bad,\" she says.\n\nBut the company's of the mindset that it's less of a risk for its hotels, where on-site staff over the last year have been individually trained to monitor and follow-up with all reviews.\n\n\"It really does require that incredible sense of confidence that says we deliver our promise,\" Helstab says.\n\nSharing all reviews - the good, bad and ugly - also requires confidence in customers, she says. If they see a negative review or Twitter message, they will likely first determine whether it has any relevance to them before letting it sway their booking decision.\n\n\"If you find that not every experience is equally positive, you will understand the framework for that experience. Maybe it was from a traveler who wasn't quite like you,\" she says. \"Maybe you want an active kids' pool with lots of amenities (unlike the writer of a particular review that complains about the pool scene).\n\nIn a Four Seasons survey, 33% of guests rate TripAdvisor \"very to extremely influential\" in their selection of a luxury hotel. In its research, the Toronto-based hotel operator also cites these stats from consulting firm e-tailing group: 92% of internet users read product reviews and 89% say that reviews influence their booking decision.\n\nPlaying up Facebook, TripAdvisor and Twitter also reflects the company's belief that social networking has completely redefined how consumers engage with brand.\n\n\"Now, it matters less what a brand says about itself; what matters is what people say about a brand,\" Four Seasons' research paper says. \"There's no room for smoke and mirrors in today's socially networked world.\"\n\nIn addition to social media usage, Four Seasons cites research showing its customers are tech-savvy. Stats from the Affluence Collaborative: 57% of wealthy consumers say they like to have the latest gadgets vs. only 18% of the general population.\n\nOther changes you'll see on the new site:\n\nFour Seasons hotels are typically among the most expensive hotels in a given destination. They compete with other luxury chains including Starwood's St. Regis, Hilton's Waldorf-Astoria and Marriott's Ritz-Carlton, as well as foreign such as Mandarin Oriental and Peninsula.",

    "text": "A warning to men considering a pricey new treatment for prostate cancer called proton therapy: Research suggests it might have more side effects than traditional radiation does.\n\nA study of Medicare records found that men treated with proton beams later had one-third more bowel problems, such as bleeding and blockages, than similar men given conventional radiation.\n\nThis is an observational study so it is not definitive, but it is one of the largest to compare these treatments. Proton therapy is rapidly growing in use \u2014 Medicare covers it \u2014 even though no rigorous studies have tested whether it is as safe or effective as usual care.\n\nIt costs around $48,000 \u2014 at least twice as much as other prostate radiation treatments. Hospitals are rushing to build proton centers, and nine are operating now \u2014 sites include Boston, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Jacksonville, Fla., and Loma Linda, Calif., east of Los Angeles. Promoters often claim it is less likely to cause complications.\n\n\"There's no clear evidence that proton therapy is better\" for prostate cancer, and the new results suggest it may cause more complications, said Dr. Ronald Chen, a radiation specialist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\nHe led the study and will give results at a medical meeting in San Francisco later this week. They were discussed Tuesday in a telephone news conference sponsored by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and two other cancer groups.\n\nProton therapy uses proton particles instead of X-rays. In theory, it targets radiation more directly to tumors and spares healthy tissue, which should lead to fewer side effects. Its value is established for treating eye and certain pediatric tumors. But it often is marketed for prostate cancer \u2014 a far more common condition.\n\nResearchers checked Medicare records on more than 12,000 men treated for early-stage prostate cancers from 2002 through 2007. Follow-up information was available for four years on average.\n\nFirst they compared an older version of external beam radiation to a newer form that now dominates the field \u2014 intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT. It, too, targets radiation more precisely to the prostate, and this is the first large study to show it was better than the older method \u2014 even though it came into use a decade ago.\n\n\"We found that patients who were treated with IMRT required fewer additional treatments after radiation which indicates better cancer control,\" Chen said. There also were slightly fewer bowel problems, although there also were slightly more sexual problems among men treated with IMRT.\n\nA second part of the study compared 684 men with proton therapy to a similar group treated with IMRT. There were 18 cases of bowel problems for every 100 proton therapy patients per each year of follow-up versus 12 such problems for those treated with IMRT.\n\n\"That's a red flag,\" said Dr. Bruce Roth, a cancer specialist at Washington University in St. Louis who is involved with the cancer conference but had no role in the study.\n\nIt's too soon to know whether proton therapy will prove more effective to justify higher side effects, but seeing this difference so soon in its use is troubling, he said. Doctors don't want a repeat of the IMRT experience, \"where it becomes the new standard of care without that comparative data,\" he said.\n\nThe federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality paid for the study, which included researchers from the National Cancer Institute. The government also is paying for a definitive study to compare proton therapy to other types.\n\nIt \"clearly is a promising therapy,\" but it has not yet shown an advantage for treating prostate cancer, said Dr. Jason Efstathiou of Massachusetts General Hospital, who will lead the new study.\n\nEarly results from patients at his hospital suggests there are fewer complications in the first six months after proton therapy, but \"maybe this is a short-term advantage\" that disappears or does not occur at every hospital using it, he said.\n\nOnly a rigorous study will tell. It starts this summer and will give results in three to five years.\n\nFollow Marilynn Marchione at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP",

Speculation abounds over which DPJ officials will take the strategy bureau job and other posts. Mr. Hatoyama said Sunday it was too early to talk about his cabinet lineup.\n\nGiven the party's agenda to increase spending for families and consumers, revamping the national budget to find funds is a crucial task.\n\nDPJ Secretary-General Katsuya Okada said Monday that when government ministries submitted budgets at the end of August as scheduled for the fiscal year beginning in April, party officials immediately began scrutinizing them. For the next fiscal year alone, the DPJ must find 7.1 trillion yen, or about $76 billion, to cover its social-spending program that includes a child allowance and elimination of highway tolls.\n\n\"This is the first hurdle we have to overcome,\" Mr. Okada said on public broadcaster NHK.\n\nThe party is also reviewing the 14-trillion-yen supplementary budget that departing Prime Minister Taro Aso has already implemented to cover his economic-stimulus plan with an eye toward revising it by canceling some projects.\n\nThe DPJ trounced the Liberal Democratic Party in the election for the Japanese parliament's lower house, giving it broad sway to remake the government. Final voting statistics Monday showed 72 million people, or 69% of eligible voters, participated, the highest percentage since the current voting system was enacted 13 years ago.\n\nTrace the recent history of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nTake a look at key indicators for Japan.\n\nThe finance and strategy-bureau positions might be the most important for a future Hatoyama administration as it looks for ways to pay for its social-spending program, which could cost 16.8 trillion yen a year by the fiscal year beginning in 2013.\n\nThe DPJ campaigned on a promise it could pay for the package in part by cutting and shaking up Japan's ranks of powerful bureaucrats. \"The ministries have too much power. They are more powerful than bureaucracies in other countries generally,\" said Kan Suzuki, vice chairman of DPJ's policy committee, in an interview.\n\nStill, paring the bureaucracy could be a difficult task. \"Politicians have been keen to cut back big government before,\" said one midranking bureaucrat in Kasumigaseki, the nexus of cabinet ministries in Tokyo. \"I don't think there will be a revolution,\" the person added.\n\nThe DPJ, which has never held power in its 12-year existence, may need bureaucrats' institutional knowledge to get things done. \"You're going to have a lot of new politicians who don't know their way from the prime minister's office to their own ministry making policy,\" said Gerald Curtis, professor of Japanese politics at Columbia University.\n\nJapan is heavily regulated, with red tape damping all kinds of activity from setting up a business to parking a bicycle. DPJ politicians say an \"iron triangle\" has developed among bureaucrats, big business and the LDP, which is stifling innovation. To break up these relationships, the DPJ proposes to decentralize the bureaucracy and fill high-ranking civil-service posts with political appointments. The DPJ also has promised to outlaw the practice of \"amakudari,\" meaning \"descent from heaven,\" whereby government officials after retirement take up senior positions in the companies they oversaw.\n\nAn effort by former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi to centralize power recorded initial success but faltered when successive administrations lost interest.\n\n\"The DPJ needs to make sure they have the right expertise as quickly as possible because the expectations of Japanese citizens are high,\" said Paige Cottingham-Streater, deputy executive director of the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation, a Washington-based policy organization focused on U.S.-Asia relations.\n\nWrite to Alison Tudor at alison.tudor@wsj.com and Yuka Hayashi at yuka.hayashi@wsj.com",

The corruption eruption in New York is reaching new heights \u2014 and depths.\n\nFrom City Hall to Albany, the sewer runneth over. It is no longer adequate to talk of a few bad apples. We are suffering through a bumper crop of rottenness.\n\nIn normal times, the fall of Sheldon Silver, sentenced yesterday to 12 years in federal prison, would be drama enough. Yet the former Democratic leader of the Assembly is joined in infamy by Dean Skelos, the former Republican leader of the state Senate, whose sentencing comes up next week on the con- man calendar.\n\nThe comeuppance of the bosses of both legislative houses and both parties in the same year is, as far as I can tell, unprecedented in modern times. Even the legendary thieves of Tammany tended to leave space between dramatic downfalls.\n\nYet the Silver-Skelos scandal is just part of the worst of times.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio is in a serious jam, as both state and federal prosecutors have his fundraising-and-favors operation in their cross hairs. Another sordid chapter would be written if the mayor himself is hit with criminal charges.\n\nThen there\u2019s Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who looked as if he had escaped a federal probe only to see a close friend and former aide suddenly land in very hot water about money paid to him by companies with state business. There\u2019s no telling where the case will lead.\n\nHow did all this happen? How did New York become such a swirling cesspool?\n\nFor answers, it is fitting that we turn to a cartoon character. It was Pogo who declared, \u201cWe have met the enemy and he is us.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds like I\u2019m blaming the victims, I plead half-guilty. We the people certainly are victims \u2014 of our own stupidity and cupidity.\n\nFirst, we have developed the very bad habit of electing people of low moral character.\n\nHaving foolishly decided that integrity is not a necessary virtue in politics, we are reaping the results. If we don\u2019t care about integrity, why should the pols?\n\nThe Legislature is especially a comfort zone for crooks. The dozens of lawmakers hauled out in handcuffs in recent years would make a bipartisan diversity specialist proud.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, blacks, whites and Latinos, upstate and down, the Convicts Club doesn\u2019t discriminate. Get caught stealing and you\u2019re admitted.\n\nSecond, this deregulation of public morals is not the whole story. The other part is greed \u2014 ours.\n\nToo many voters survey the corruption pattern and don\u2019t conclude that they want an honest mayor or governor or representative. They conclude that they want someone who will take care of them. They want their own crook.\n\nOf course, they don\u2019t put it that way, but their choices reflect the entitlement mentality, where people look at government as a source of favors, even a cash machine.\n\nThey assume somebody else will make deposits so they can make withdrawals.\n\nNaturally, plenty of politicians oblige them in their fantasies. They run for office on the promise of womb-to-tomb handouts, and spend their days dreaming up new ways to \u201chelp\u201d people.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that many officials also \u201chelp\u201d themselves. The old joke about Albany now applies to the city as well: People get elected to do good, and stay to do well.\n\nCorruption is not cheap; it affects everybody and raises the cost of living and working in New York, not to mention the cost of cynicism.\n\nHow to clean up the stables? By all means, we should support tougher ethics laws and stiffer penalties for those who break them. Politicians who violate their offices must not be rewarded with taxpayer-funded pensions. And it\u2019s time that Albany try term limits, which would prevent the accumulation of the vast power that Silver and Skelos abused.\n\nYet there already are sensible laws on the books, and they\u2019re not proving to be much of a deterrent. So another, better law will not be a silver bullet.\n\nVigilance from voters, and self-discipline, is the answer. We have to make it clear that integrity is mandatory, and prove we mean it by demanding less from government by way of handouts.\n\nShrinking the size of government is the best way to shrink its power, and the corruption of that power. Instead of looking for endless favors, what if we focused on ending government\u2019s favor bank?\n\nWhat if we elected people who promised not only integrity, but also modesty about the offices they seek? What if we said we don\u2019t expect bureaucrats to solve all of life\u2019s problems?\n\nIn that case, less government would be more. More honest and more worthy of our trust.\n\nEither way, we get the government we deserve.\n\nThe leftist in a robe, Judge Shira Scheindlin, who ruled against the NYPD\u2019s stop-and-frisk program in 2013, is retiring with a defense of her outrageous decision.\n\nInadvertently, she ends up confirming that she was biased from the start.\n\nScheindlin smeared the department, Commissioner Ray Kelly and Mayor Michael Bloomberg by finding the tactic racially biased and unconstitutional. The trial was so loaded that an appeals panel stayed her ruling and removed her from the case. For good reason.\n\nKelly and Bloomberg, Scheindlin now tells the New York Times, looked \u201clike two angry white men\u201d the day after her verdict. \u201cThey seemed out of touch with the issues that the communities cared about . . . They didn\u2019t seem to get it.\u201d\n\nNowhere in the Times does she make a constitutional argument to defend her ruling, or one based on evidence. She was clearly against the police and, as the appeals court ruled, steered the case to herself so she could rule on it.\n\nThe city could have prevailed on appeal, but Mayor Bill de Blasio, who benefited from Scheindlin\u2019s ruling, dropped it.\n\nThis is judicial activism of the worst kind. Scheindlin imposed her anti-police prejudice on the city and hid behind her robe.\n\nGood riddance to a bad judge.\n\nRen\u00e9e Fleming knows grand melodrama when she sees it.\n\nSpeaking at the celebration of her 25 years at the Metropolitan Opera, the renowned soprano had an idea for a new production: \u201cNext year, we should do \u2018Donald Trump: The Opera,\u2019\u201d she said to loud laughter. \u201cI want to play Megyn Kelly and we can still have a tragic ending.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton, in March, said her energy plan would mean \u201cwe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, campaigning in West Virginia coal country, she said, \u201cWhat I was saying is that the way things are going now, we will continue to lose jobs. I didn\u2019t mean that we were going to do it. What I said was, that is going to happen unless we take action to try to and help and prevent it.\u201d\n\nAnybody believe her? About anything?",

They say the majority of the genealogical research was carried through four generations, to include great-grandchildren of the dead.\n\nBut the process becomes complicated when you consider that St. Johannes dates to before the Civil War, when record-keeping was imprecise and it was common for families to have more than a dozen children. So you have large family trees with many distant cousins who may never have met but trace their roots to the same ancestors.\n\nIn my story, I mention one woman who said she had power of attorney from her 98-great-aunt to arrange the grave relocations of her ancestors.

Relatives must certify with the state that they are the closest next of kin and that other relatives with equal kinship don\u2019t object, but the state does not require all living relatives of the dead to be notified or give their approval.\n\nWhich may help explain why some relatives are finding out that distant relatives they have never met are making arrangements to move their ancestors\u2019 graves while they are being left in the dark.\n\nJoin Trib Nation on Facebook for more of the how and why of Tribune journalism.",

    "text": "As former chief technology officer of the Obama for America presidential re-election campaign, Harper Reed helped propel Chicago\u2019s tech scene into the global spotlight. He's also the former CTO of skinnyCorp, parent of T-shirt startup Threadless, and is getting ready to launch a mobile retail firm called Modest in the next few months. He shared advice for entrepreneurs and his takes on healthcare.gov and New Year's resolutions.\n\nQ. What advice do you give to startup founders?\n\nA. One of the important lessons we always forget is to trust people. It's a very lonely world when you're in it by yourself. You have all these great friends that you should be trusting and hanging out with. That's the first thing.\n\nThe second thing is you never know what's going to happen, so you have to give in a little bit and go with the flow. None of us were prepared for the Obama campaign in a reasonable way in regards to our past. To try to be prepared for something that's coming is not really the best plan. You want to be open so when an eventuality comes, you're not necessarily surprised by it. You're able to use it, participate with it and grow.\n\nQ. Chicago is always being compared to Silicon Valley as a startup market. What do you think Chicago should get more credit for?\n\nA. I'm actually really tired of talking about how Chicago can be more like San Francisco. What I want to know is how Chicago can be more Chicago, if Chicago is using its power to do great things.\n\nQ. What do you think Chicago\u2019s power is?\n\nA. I think it's making businesses that are robust and interesting and often more traditional. Orbitz is a great example, even BrightTag (a marketing technology platform) and Keeper (security software). These are all taking ideas that are built elsewhere and taking it to the logical conclusion of a product and being successful at it.\n\nIt's not about how do we build the next floating robot that walks our dog or some big-picture, unbelievable thing. Groupon wasn't the first coupon website. They just happened to be the best. They took everyone\u2019s aggregate tech and put it together to make a very successful, useful website. And that goes for most of the startups around Chicago.\n\nQ. What do you think about the changes Howard Tullman is planning at 1871?\n\nA. I would like to see more of 1871 be involved in the management of 1871. I think Howard will do that because he's pretty good at interacting and listening to people.\n\nQ. Do you think people\u2019s expectations for Obama's healthcare.gov were realistic?\n\nA. I think expectations were unrealistic. There's no website that has ever launched that is as big as healthcare.gov from the get-go. Facebook eventually got there. But they've also got lots of years of experience. I think there's a lot of stuff that could be different, but I don't have any other comments on it.\n\nQ. Did they ask you for help?\n\nQ. You put a lot of personal data, like your height, weight and other things, into the public sphere. Is anything too personal?\n\nA. I'm sure there is. But the immediate thought I have is, share as much as you want. For me, it happens to be a little bit more. For someone else it may be a little bit less, or more.\n\nQ. On that note, do you have a New Year's resolution?\n\nA. I don't, mostly because I don\u2019t really believe in them. It seems silly to constantly be iterating on yourself one time a year. Everyone knows what's wrong with him or her, but we have to wait until the New Year to do it? Why don\u2019t we just fix it?\n\nQ-and-As are edited for clarity and length.",

According to Dr Catti Moss, most melanomas occur in existing blemishes.\n\nThe Northamptonshire GP says: \"Every week do a full-body check for moles that are asymmetrical, have irregular borders, change colour or are larger than a pencil eraser.\"\n\nShe says you should consult your doctor immediately if you see any changes and also check for sores that won't heal. \"You're particularly at risk if you're fair-skinned, sun bathe or use sunbeds,\" she adds.\n\nSKIN is the body's biggest organ and can be a warning sign for nutritional deficiencies and illnesses.\n\nLook in skin folds behind your knees and under your arms for signs of redness and itching, which might signify eczema.\n\nRed, flaky, round or oval-shaped lesions could signal ring-worm and hundreds of stinging, tiny red bumps could be heat rash.\n\nMeanwhile for glowing skin, dermatologist Dr Christopher Rowland-Payne says: \"Healthy omega-3 oils from oily fish, avocados and flaxseed help moisten the skin from the inside out.\"\n\nBADLY fitting bras can cause health risks like muscle strain, constricted breathing and irritable bowel syndrome, according to Dr Alex Clarke.\n\nThe professor from London's Royal Free Hospital says: \"Look for soft, load-bearing shoulder straps and straps which don't dig in.\n\n\"If there are signs of bruising on your skin where the underside of the cup touches, you haven't got sufficient support. Likewise, if there's any bruising around the top of the cup or by the shoulder straps, it's too tight.\"\n\nShe also suggests getting a professional bra fitting every six months (free at John Lewis and M&S).\n\nGETTING out the tape measure could save your life, according to researchers in Dallas.\n\nBeneficial ... measuring your waist\n\nThey claim it's more beneficial to check your waist measurement than to get on the bathroom scales.\n\nEven a small pot belly can mean a higher risk of heart problems even if your weight is normal. Doctors regard more than 35 inches for a woman as a danger sign.\n\nDietician Dahlia Campbell says: \"Lower abdominal fat by upping your overall exercise \u0096 sit-ups alone won't cut it. And cut back on carbs and go for lean protein sources such as chicken or fish.\"\n\nFREQUENT bruising can be a sign of liver disease such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, and in extreme cases, leukaemia, says Dr Moss.\n\nBruising easily is often the result of taking blood-thinning drugs such as aspirin or steroids, while older people bruise more as their weak blood capillaries break easily.\n\n\"Most often easy bruising is simply genetic and nothing to worry about. But it's always good to get it checked out by your GP,\" she says.\n\nSome foods may help \u0096 particularly fruit and veg rich in vitamin C and bioflavonoids such as oranges, berries, grapes and green beans.\n\n\"AS well as putting strain on your spine and giving you a bad back, poor posture restricts your airways which can lead to tension headaches, stress and lethargy,\" says Richard Bricknell, director at the Bristol Physiotherapy Clinic.\n\nPoor posture can even lead to depression and anxiety as blood and natural feel-good endorphins can't flow to the brain easily.\n\n\"With your blouse off, stand side-on to a wall-length mirror and straighten your spine and pull your shoulders back,\" he advises. \"Do this regularly and you'll develop 'muscle memory'.\"\n\nMANY women suffer some water retention pre-menstrually because of changes in hormone levels which is nothing to worry about.\n\nRarely, more noticeable retention is caused by an underlying medical disorder, such as diabetes or kidney or liver disease. Swelling is worse in hot weather and can be exacerbated by stress, a high-carb diet, alcohol and prolonged standing.\n\nDr Moss advises: \"Avoid high-carb diets, especially with sugary or salty food, and focus on high-fibre food such as fruit and veg. Losing even small amounts of weight can have a big impact, so increase exercise too.\"",

    "text": "Harvard has everything: a faculty packed with Nobelists, the world\u2019s largest private library system, an alumnus in the White House, and an endowment larger than most countries\u2019 GDP. But for the past six years it has had to make do without a place to display its art. The oldest university in the United States has been undertaking a major reorganization of its museums, fusing three independent institutions into a single, major new home. It wasn\u2019t easy, but after years of designs and delays, it\u2019s done.\n\nThe new Harvard art museums \u2013 with a deliberately plural name, and comprising the main Fogg museum; the Busch-Reisinger museum, focused on Germanic art and the Arthur M Sackler museum, an Asian arts institution \u2013 are now housed in a single, 240,000-square foot facility, with double the space of the previous buildings, plus theaters, seminar rooms, study centers and teaching galleries. At the top, under massive skylights, are three gleaming new conversation studios with copious natural light and enviable views of the Boston skyline. It opens to the public this weekend after two weeks of perpetual opening ceremonies, geared towards everyone from the local Cambridge community to dolled-up undergrads.\n\nHarvard has been home to an art museum since the late 19th century. But its cramped quarters and awkward divisions for Asian and Germanic art meant that it never achieved the stature of other great university museums: those of Smith, Oberlin, UCLA and especially Yale, whose gallery reopened after its own expansion project in 2012. (I should probably disclose that I\u2019m a product of Harvard\u2019s great rival, and that I volunteered for several years at Yale\u2019s museums.) Uniting the museums in one building, and reorganizing their curatorial structure along the way, makes a very positive change. About 2,000 works are on view from the 250,000-strong collection, and dialogues among the formerly siloed institutions \u2013 a Louise Bourgeois among ancient marbles, or a Gerhard Richter from the Busch-Reisinger collection alongside extraordinary Fluxus works on paper from the Fogg collection \u2013 make the place feel almost like a new museum. (Harvard doesn\u2019t break down its budget to disclose the final cost, though the museums\u2019 own philanthropic division raised over $250m for the project. A total budget of about $350m has been widely reported, though not confirmed.)\n\nBack in 1999, Harvard had tried to build an all-new museum on the Charles River, but the project fell through. Staying on campus was a trickier job, so they called a professional. You might wonder if the world needed another museum building designed by Renzo Piano, the Genoa-born, Paris-based architect \u2013 and Italian senator-for-life \u2013 who has built two dozen art galleries now, including 14 in America alone. In the last decade he has inaugurated new homes for Astrup Fearnley Museet in Oslo and the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, while the Art Institute of Chicago, the Morgan Library in New York and the Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth have also been Pianoized with new glass canopies, elevated courtyards, light-modulating roofs. Just over the Charles, Piano\u2019s firm undertook a sensitive expansion of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, a counterfeit Venetian palazzo now joined by a floating copper and brick extension. And next spring Piano opens the biggest project of them all: the new Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, a hulking white monolith on the Hudson River.\n\nHis touch is uneven. Some of Piano\u2019s museums are extraordinary, such as the Gardner edition and the Nasher, which do wonders with natural light. Others are unwieldy. At the Astrup Fearnley visitors have to walk outside to go from one gallery to another, even during the Norwegian winter, while his Morgan extension is an unworkable mashup of old and new, with strange circulation patterns and a courtyard so oversized it seems to insult the galleries.\n\nHarvard is one of his better projects, perhaps because he faced serious constraints. The red-brick entrance to the Fogg Museum, on Quincy Street facing Harvard Yard, is landmarked. Piano has maintained that as well as the Fogg\u2019s Mediterranean-style central courtyard \u2013 but he\u2019s chopped off its old roof and extended the space by several stories, cladding the upper floors with glass and flooding the atrium with light.\n\nThe old courtyard remains the hub of the museum. It\u2019s like a city square, which you traverse multiple times throughout your visit, and which you gaze down on from the floors above. But everything else has been taken apart and put back together. The three museums own their devoted sectors of the building, but they blend into one another so seamlessly that they\u2019re barely distinct. In the same way the galleries ringing the courtyard have no single entrance, but rather multiple ways in. A bold Max Beckmann triptych peeks out of one door, a portrait of George Washington from another. The curators\u2019 narrative is open-ended and exploratory, oriented away from showcasing masterpiece and more towards modest but ingenious surprises: Roman sarcophagi alongside classics-obsessed academic painting of the 19th century, or a Paul Strand photograph of his wife, Rebecca Salsbury, next to a painting she made. It\u2019s a teaching museum rather than a temple.\n\nIn many ways, Piano\u2019s Harvard art museums stand in opposition to Yale\u2019s praised new gallery. Yale delights in disjunction, articulating the museum\u2019s history and expansion through different spatial experiences. Harvard went for a radical overhaul disguised as a modest intervention. It wears its ambitions lightly, which is no bad thing in a moment when newly concentrated wealth is giving rise to some much showier museum architecture. The mixing of brick, wood and glass on the outside is unspectacular, but perhaps better for that: embellishing the Harvard campus without disrupting it, and from the entrance facing Harvard Yard you can\u2019t even see the new glass roof. And like at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Piano\u2019s first major building, here the guts of the building are on display in places \u2013 visible struts and joints on the glass louvers, a proudly visible ventilation system up in the conservation studios.\n\nOn the Prescott Street side of the museum, however, at a new entrance, Piano has made one very bad call. The Harvard art museums have an especially rowdy neighbor: the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, a glorious concrete bunker designed by Le Corbusier in 1962. The home of Harvard\u2019s art department is the Swiss pioneer\u2019s only building in the United States, and it features a sinuous ramp that bisects the structure, rising from street level to the third floor and then falling back to grade not far from the Harvard Art Museums\u2019 new entrance. Piano, wanting to be neighborly, has extended the disabled access ramp at his own museum to meet up with Corb\u2019s S-curve, soldering his building to the master\u2019s. Not a good move. It diminishes Piano\u2019s work, as if all he was providing was connective tissue, and it affronts Carpenter Center, which should have been left alone.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessary to link these neighbors up so literally; from inside the new Harvard Art Museums, Piano and Corb get along just fine. In glass winter gardens that extend from the south facade, arresting terra cotta models by Bernini stand framed by the Carpenter center, juxtaposing heft and light. Other new glass-fronted spaces feature stained-glass windows that now enjoy streaming light, and sculpture ranging from German modernism to South Asian Buddhist art. Japanese painting and works on paper from the renowned Feinberg collection, seen earlier this year at the Met and now promised to Harvard, is a particular highlight of the new museum. One amazing screen \u2013 displayed, like much of Harvard\u2019s stash, without glass barriers \u2013 shows gruff Portuguese traders crashing into Yokohama, an early relic of globalization.\n\nThe inaugural special exhibition, of murals by Mark Rothko, is a model of what Harvard \u2013 and museums of this size and calibre \u2013 should be doing. Rothko produced five murals (actually six; he abandoned the last) for a Harvard building project in 1961\u201362. They\u2019ve since faded, but Rothko\u2019s strategy of staining untreated canvas meant that conservators couldn\u2019t repaint the works without ruining them. Instead, working with colleagues at MIT Media Lab, the curators and conservators produced a painstaking, pixel-by-pixel digital corrective, projected on to the canvases to compensate for the color loss. In the dim galleries the projections are unobtrusive, and suddenly you see Rothko as you never have before \u2013 but all you have to do is throw a piece of paper between the wall and the projector to peek at the unrestored paintings. It\u2019s a bold proposition and unforgettable aesthetic experience. Which is just what Harvard should be doing: exhibitions that engage the brain as much as the eye.",

    "text": "Dr. Denton A. Cooley, the pioneering heart surgeon, is accustomed to having an audience when he wields his scalpel. Since he performed the first successful human heart transplant in the nation more than 30 years ago, a steady stream of medical professionals and students have watched him at work in the operating room.\n\nOn Aug. 19, Dr. Cooley made a different sort of history in front of a wider audience than he had ever had before. He performed a 3 hour 40 minute coronary bypass procedure in Houston that was transmitted live over the Internet. More than 150,000 people tuned in to the Webcast over the course of the day. In the months since, tens of thousands more have reportedly logged on for information about the procedure.\n\nThe surgery was one of nine medical procedures put on the Web in recent months by AHN.com, the World Wide Web companion to the cable channel America's Health Network.\n\nSince AHN.com made headlines last June with its Webcast of the birth of a baby, the site has made a signature -- and a multimedia educational experience -- of these live medical dramas.\n\nIn terms of attracting attention and audience, Victoria's Secret fashion shows they are not. But they do generate publicity for the network. And they also help overcome one of the primary difficulties faced by independent ventures: getting carried on cable systems.\n\n''Distribution is the most obviously challenging part of the cable network business these days,'' said Webster Golinkin, president and co-founder of America's Health Network, which is based at Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla. ''While people talk about the 500-channel environment, it's not here yet.''\n\nLast year, the network started the site to extend its reach, and, Mr. Golinkin said, to respond to a growing public interest in health information on the Web. ''Most other media businesses kind of have their priorities in one place rather than the other,'' Mr. Golinkin said. ''It's either an Internet company or a cable network, and if they have the other thing it's a stepchild.''\n\nAmerica's Health Network is available in 9.5 million American homes, and an average of 2 million people around the world visit the Web site each month, where a live signal of the television channel is available, said J. Tod Fetherling, president of the Web venture. Its potential to reach a wider audience is limited only by the availability of Internet connections. Twenty-two percent of its users come from overseas, said Mr. Fetherling, who cites traffic from places like China, Malaysia and Germany.\n\nWhen partnerships that place AHN's content on ABCnews.com, Yahoo, ESPN.com and Real Networks are figured in, it is probable that AHN reaches a wider audience on the Web than it does on television. (A syndication deal with Katz Dimensions, a subsidiary of Katz Media Group, puts AHN content on radio, too.)\n\nThe Webcast surgeries, accompanied by the subdued play-by-play of a narrator, have the voyeuristic, cinema verite feel of behind-the-scenes emergency room shows.\n\nThese broadcasts almost did not happen. The television staff was concerned about showing the childbirth live, but the Web staff jumped on the idea, Mr. Fetherling said.\n\n''Being interactive folks, we said, 'Heck, yeah, let's try it.' We had 1.4 million people watch the video stream live, and it blew everybody away,'' he said. ''It showed us health on the Internet and what it can be.''\n\nWhile television can demystify and humanize medical procedures for information-hungry viewers, Mr. Fetherling said, the Internet allows ''on demand'' access about specific procedures and ailments.\n\n''Health care is episodic,'' he said. ''You go on a research binge when you are diagnosed with cancer or diabetes.''\n\nThe notion of the Internet as the digital age Dr. Spock is a growing one. In addition to two coming cable health channels from Discovery and Tele-Communications Inc., health resources on the Internet have proliferated over the last several months. CNN.com has just announced a partnership with an on-line health resource called WebMD. In March, a private on-line service for doctors called Medcast, which bills itself as the ''Bloomberg for the medical profession,'' is being started by Greenberg News Network in Atlanta. Alan Greenberg, a former publisher of Esquire magazine, had built Medical News Network for Whittle Communications earlier this decade before starting his own company.\n\nAnother offering, the Seattle-based Onhealth.com, provides news, columnists and data bases of health information, and features a weekly audio talk show whose host is Brooke Gladstone of National Public Radio.\n\nTwo things have radically changed the way the public looks at its health: managed care and the Internet, said Rebecca Farwell, the editor in chief of Onhealth.com.\n\n''Suddenly, you don't have to go to the library and look at books published two years ago for information,'' Ms. Farwell said. ''You don't have to go to a support group, or talk to your doctors. You can get everything in one place on the Internet.''\n\nIncluding, increasingly, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, which can be purchased on line at the click of a button. Advertisers are eager to offer their wares to a natural audience for them. At the same time, doctors say they are eager to demystify their work.\n\n''It's interesting how little the average person knows about physiology and anatomy,'' said Dr. Cooley, the heart surgeon, who added that he was honored to perform a coronary bypass on the Internet. ''It helps people to know what goes on during the procedure, for a person to see a beating heart.''\n\nNow that viewers of AHN have seen that, what does the channel do for an encore? ''Like everything else, you always have to keep pushing the envelope to find the thing people think is extraordinary,'' Mr. Golinkin said. ''We're constantly trying to figure out what cable can do and what the Internet can do that will give people information and insights into their health and well-being. I don't know what that's going to be.''\n\nPhotos/Chart: ''Invasive Surgery'' America's Health Network has become a pioneer in broad-casting live operations on the Web.

    "text": "Sacha Baron Cohen has hit headlines for his stunt at the Oscars, where he presented an award in character as his Staines-based alter-ego Ali G. Wading into the #OscarsSoWhite debate, the character expressed sympathy for his \u201cbredren\u201d, saying in his trademark Staines patois \u201cI is here representing all of them that\u2019s been overlooked. Will Smith, Idris Elbow, and of course that amazing black bloke from Star Wars\u2026 Darth Vader.\u201d\n\nThe comedian has since revealed that he was warned by the Academy not to pull any stunts and that his wife, Isla Fisher, had helped him smuggle the outfit in to the ceremony. However, this isn\u2019t the first time Cohen has caused controversy at an award ceremony \u2013 and it would have been out of character for him to appear out of character.\n\nWhen he won his first Bafta in 2000 for Da Ali G Show, Cohen wasn\u2019t allowed in to the ceremony because security personnel didn\u2019t believe he looked like the slack-jawed mouthpiece of the \u2018yoof\u2019. And In 2007, Cohen turned down the opportunity to present an Oscar because the Academy would only allow him on stage if he promised not to dress up as his Kazakhstani alter-ego Borat.\n\nHere are his top award show pranks.\n\nBaron Cohen donned his ceremonial uniform as Admiral-General Aladeen for the Oscars red carpet in 2012. Having had his ticket revoked for the ceremony itself, Cohen convinced the Academy to let him appear in character to promote The Dictator on the red carpet.\n\nRyan Seacrest gamely agreed to interview Aladeen, who greeted him with \u201cRyan, hello! Death to the West!\u201d before cracking a series of controversial jokes. All the while Cohen was clutching a jar of ashes which he claimed belonged to his \u201cdear friend and doubles tennis partner, Kim Jong Il\u201d who wanted to \u201cbe sprinkled over the red carpet and Halle Berry\u2019s chest again\u201d. Unfortunately for Seacrest, Cohen stumbled and the dusty contents of the jar ended up all over the E! presenter.\n\nIt was clear that Seacrest hadn't quite forgotten this incident at this year's Oscars, and declined the chance to interview the Grimsby star on the red carpet. Cohen interrupted an interview with Lady Gaga, attempting to say hi to his old friend. Seacrest did his best to ignore Cohen and focus on the interview. He did, however, spare a moment to crack a joke, asking if he had anything in his hands.\n\nWhen it came to his turn to present the MTV award for Best Male Performance, Cohen\u2019s outrageous Austrian fashion reporter Br\u00fcno did so in style\u2026 of sorts. Dressed as an S&M angel in wings, and a jockstrap, the star descended using wires, before getting all tangled up. He finally escaped his wiry confines, landing directly on an unimpressed Eminem \u2013 his bare buttocks inches away from the rapper\u2019s face.\n\nAs Eminem\u2019s security tried to untangle Br\u00fcno he protested \u201cHey, don\u2019t touch me guys! I\u2019ve already got a boyfriend. Hey guys, let\u2019s continue this in my hotel room!\u201d\n\nOnce freed, Eminem promptly stormed out of the ceremony. Although it has since been revealed that the rapper was in on the stunt.\n\nThey may be less renowned than the Oscars, but that didn\u2019t stop Cohen pulling an outlandish prank at the LA Baftas.\n\nWhen accepting the Charlie Chaplin Britannia for Excellence in Comedy award, the actor \u201ctripped\u201d pushing wheelchair-bound Grace Cullington (introduced as the oldest-living person to have worked with Chaplin) off the stage. The stunt elicited gasps from the audience, who relaxed once they realised it was all a big joke.\n\nWhen presented with an outstanding achievement gong at the 2012 British Comedy Awards, Cohen couldn\u2019t resist accepting the accolade dressed as the character that made him famous. He also took the opportunity to make one of his most risqu\u00e9 jokes not long after the truth about Jimmy Savile emerged.\n\n\"Can you believe it's been 10 years since I's been on the telly?\u201d he asked the audience. \u201cTimes has been tough means me now well skint. These days I has got to buy me tracksuits from second hand shops.\" Cohen then turned around to reveal the name Savile was embroidered across the back of his garish gold tracksuit.\n\nCohen didn\u2019t even plan this one, but Borat managed to upstage the Kazakhstan shooting team.\n\nWhen Maria Dmitrienko won a gold medal in Kuwait in 2012, she was left bemused when the event\u2019s organisers downloaded the parody version of the Kazakhstan\u2019s national anthem from Borat: culture Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan by mistake.\n\nThe spoof song includes the lines \u201cKazakhstan\u2019s prostitutes cleanest in the region/ Except of course Turkmenistan\u2019s\u201d.",

    "text": "With Hurricane Sandy about to hit the Northeast, many people run the risk of sustaining injury and illness related to the storm.\n\nDr. Caitlin Jones, medical director of the emergency department at Downstate Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn listed a few tips on how to keep your family safe and healthy as the storm passes over the mainland \u2013 and after the rain and winds clear.\n\nNo matter what, if you are injured during the clean-up process \u2013 even if it\u2019s a cut or scrape \u2013 you need to get a tetanus shot, Jones said. Tetanus, a deadly infection affecting the nervous system, is caused by the bacteria C. tetani, which resides in the soil. The infection is contracted when spores of the bacteria enter the body through an open wound. After the storm is over, mud and dirt will potentially be an issue, so it\u2019s important to take no chances with tetanus.\n\nWhen it comes to eating the food in your fridge, Jones said you need to make sure the fridge was on throughout the storm.\n\n\u201cIf you were evacuated, do not use your refrigerated or frozen food until you are certain whether or not your home sustained a power loss while you were away,\u201d Jones said. \u201cYour food may have spoiled during the outage and then refrozen - but it's still spoiled.\u201d\n\nJones also cautioned against drinking tap water until health officials in your area tell you to do so.\n\nIn order to be injury-free once the storm is over, don\u2019t get immediately comfortable with your surroundings \u2013 even if you\u2019re in your own home.\n\n\u201cBe careful when reentering evacuated homes,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOften, stairs and foundations are weakened by water damage, which can cause you to fall and sustain injuries. Make sure there's no smell of gas and that there is no danger of downed power lines in the vicinity.\u201d\n\nWhen cleaning up an evacuated house, people need to use waterproof gloves and boots to avoid touching harmful mold. Jones said this is especially true for asthmatics. In general, the risk for various diseases will be heightened \u2013 so maintaining good hygiene is key.\n\n\u201cViral diseases such as coughs, colds, (and) diarrhea do circulate in places where people congregate, such as shelters,\u201d Jones said. \u201cMinimize your risk by frequent hand-washing and use of hand sanitizers.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to deadly diseases uncommon in the United States, Jones said there is little reason for concern. A mass outbreak of cholera or typhoid is highly unlikely.",

    "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 On Monday, the CEO of a young company took to Twitter to lambast the New York Times for criticizing his product. At first glance the controversy seems like nothing new \u2014 executives often claim reporters are full of it when they disagree with what\u2019s published. But this kerfuffle has some fresh twists: the CEO was Elon Musk, co-creator of PayPal and the man behind electric car-maker Tesla and commercial rocket outfit SpaceX \u2014 a visionary inventor who is smart enough and rich enough to make his visions reality. In accusing the Times\u2019 John M. Broder of not accurately portraying his recent trip in the Model S, he cited data that Tesla had on hand \u2014 the car has about 30 built-in computers logging its every move. And the trip itself, from Washington D.C. to Manhattan, was plagued by the kind of problems that champions of electric vehicles fear most: Charging was inconvenient, and the range of the car wasn\u2019t accurate, turning what should have been a painless cruise into a hapless misadventure.\n\nTesla\u2019s TSLA stock began sinking after the Times article posted, then Musk cried false on Twitter, then the stock crept up a bit. But neither John M. Broder nor Elon Musk have addressed the larger issue: Why is Tesla building charging stations? Shouldn\u2019t that be someone else\u2019s job?\n\nThis question has been nagging at me for a while now, because I also drove a Model S \u2014 albeit through much more pleasant conditions than Mr. Broder \u2014 and was disappointed by both the location of Tesla\u2019s Supercharge stations and the slow rate of recharge in every other publicly available charge port. When I drove the Model S, the purpose wasn\u2019t simply to travel from point A (Los Angeles) to point B (San Francisco). The great promise of a car like the Tesla Model S is that it is an electric vehicle without compromise: a luxury sports car that handles better, accelerates quicker, and is priced on par with a lot of other luxury sports cars (about $50,000-$90,000). And you can drive it, really drive it, quite far on a full charge. So why not drive on the prettiest, windiest, wickedest roads you can?\n\nMORE: GM wants to sell Americans on diesel\n\nWell, you can\u2019t. The Achilles heel for all electrics has always been so-called range anxiety. Recharging, and finding a charge station, takes some planning. (Though that is not so difficult, really \u2014 there are many apps, with maps included, for that purpose. Mr. Broder didn\u2019t seem to use any of them.) Tesla\u2019s answer to its customers\u2019 range anxiety issues is the Supercharger station. But to see such stations as the solution is to miss the real point of a Tesla Supercharger station and what it represents. A Supercharger station is a sales-and-marketing tool, the same way Google\u2019s super-fast internet in Kansas City is a sales-and-marketing tool. Tesla is a company that makes cars, Google GOOG is a company built on Internet search and advertising dollars \u2014 neither wants to be responsible for building the transportation or information infrastructures of the 21st century. They do, however, want to sell us their visions of the future. Both stunts are a way of proving to the world what is possible.\n\nSo if the purpose of a Supercharger station is to drag us (the consumer and the competition) into the future \u2014 well, right now it\u2019s still early days, and not particularly pretty or convenient.\n\nThe guy most painfully aware of how difficult building a robust electric car infrastructure will be is J.B. Straubel, Tesla\u2019s chief technology officer. After my trip in the Model S, I spoke to J.B. about the limitations of our current charge network. California does not lack for charge stations, but most are so slow as to be nearly irrelevant for road-tripping. And even at Tesla\u2019s fast-charging ports it can take up to an hour to reach a full charge. The most troubling thing, to my mind, was that so many of these charging stations were in public parks, DMV- or government-owned parking lots, or blah strip malls \u2014 in other words, no place in which you, the wealthy progressive owner of a fast and sexy car, would like to hang out for the next hour. How can it be that charge stations aren\u2019t yet real estate plays? If I were the representative of a business association in Cute Smalltown USA, I would be hounding Tesla and every other fast-charge company around to build a port or two in my downtown, so that Tesla drivers (and any other electric car owners) might wander around, eat and drink, and buy, buy, buy. \u201cIs this not happening?\u201d I asked Straubel. \u201cHow can this not be happening?\u201d He sighed and said that, in fact, it\u2019s the exact opposite. Then he told me the story of Harris Ranch.\n\nMORE: Toyota wants to win in pickups\n\nIf you live in California and have traveled Interstate 5, you know Harris Ranch for two reasons: The smell of its thousands of cattle is ripe enough to knock you backwards on a warm day; it is the only place along the highway for a good long stretch to stop and get food. Straubel courted Harris Ranch for years as a potential location for a Supercharge station. He explained the benefits to them, the type of clientele they stood to draw. Still, they were leery. The future is hard to see, and the rancher turned restaurateur/hotelier was risk-averse. What if they built the charge station, and no one came to use it, and all they had was one less parking space? But Tesla was footing the bill, so Harris Ranch decided to give it a try.\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d Straubel told me, \u201cit\u2019s a small success disaster: There\u2019s only one connector and it\u2019s totally congested. The line is six vehicles deep on the weekends. Now, we\u2019re expanding that station by a factor of 6 or 8.\u201d\n\nThe future may be hard to see, but this much is certain: cars will someday run on something other than petroleum, because someday we will run out of oil. Right now, cars that run on lithium-ion batteries seem to be our best alternative. And today, amazingly, electric cars running on such batteries exist that in many ways are better machines \u2014 more efficient and more fun to drive \u2014 than internal combustion-powered ones. There aren\u2019t too many models available, and most are too costly for the average consumer, so only about one out of every 20,000 cars on the road is fully electric. Still, the number is growing and surely would grow even faster if electrics weren\u2019t limited by infrastructure \u2014 specifically, a scarcity of quick, convenient fuel stations. It\u2019s a chicken-and-egg problem. The cars are here, the stations are not.\n\nTesla is building some stations so that it can sell more cars, but it isn\u2019t in the charge station business. (Musk claims, provocatively, that Tesla is not a car company, but a technology company.) The existence of Supercharger stations increases the value of a Tesla car, but right now no other cars can charge on these outlets. Thankfully, Tesla isn\u2019t the only electric carmaker out there, and so its competitors will try to build cars that can hold a charge as long as Tesla\u2019s, and drive as far \u2014 but will they, too, embark on building their own charging network? Will we end up with a lot of separate charge stations, all for different cars, made by all the different carmakers? Not likely. My guess is were some other company to begin offering a way to charge a Tesla, or any other electric car, as rapidly as Tesla has, Musk and Co. would be delighted. After all, Tesla\u2019s Supercharge stations exist for the sole benefit of Tesla owners, and for everyone else they are as useless and symbolic as a planted flag that says: We are here, we are the future \u2014 now, please, won\u2019t you catch up?",

    "text": "Writer Tom Bissell has won major awards, including the Rome Prize and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He's a contributing editor at the Virginia Quarterly Review, publishes regularly in all the right places, teaches at Portland State, and writes incisive, layered nonfiction books, including \"The Father of All Things: A Marine, His Son and the Legacy of Vietnam.\"\n\nYet from a position of esteemed literary acclaim, he's begun staking out territory firmly in pop culture, first with \"Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter,\" now out in paperback. That's not all -- as Aaron Mesh writes in a profile of Bissell in Willamette Week, \"I saw the best mind of my generation, and he asked me to watch a crappy movie.\"\n\nThat movie is none other than \"The Room,\" a 2003 independent hyperdrama that's become a cult favorite for its incessant awfulness. Bissell has become obsessed with the movie, writing about it in Harper's and signing on to co-author a book with Greg Sestero, the actor (well, sort of) who played the film's hunk and betrayer.\n\n\"I think Greg's and my desire is the same: to write something first-rate about something fifth-rate,\" Bissell tells Mesh. \"At some point I kind of realized: This could be the novel I never write.\" The book is tentatively titled \"Locked Inside the Room.\"\n\nTom Bissell is not a household name in Portland.

    "text": "Donald Trump has been both an avid producer and consumer of popular culture for decades, long before the Republican presidential nominee made his political ambitions clear.\n\nAside from his former hosting gigs on NBC reality shows \"The Apprentice\" and \"The Celebrity Apprentice,\" Trump has also taken on a number of cameo roles in films, TV shows, and commercials, often playing a version of himself.\n\nOutside of his own appearances, though, Trump has made sure to make his pop-culture interests well-documented.\n\nAs it turns out, Trump appreciates a variety of great films, musicians, and TV shows, as well as a few not-so-great ones. And he reads more than just \"The Art of the Deal.\" You'll probably be surprised by the mix.\n\nRead on to see Donald Trump's favorite things in popular culture:\n\nOrsen Welles' classic fictional take on the life of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst is reportedly one of Trump's favorite films.\n\n\"I think you learn in 'Kane' that maybe wealth isn't everything,\" Trump once said of the film in an unreleased documentary. \"Because he had the wealth, but he didn't have the happiness.\"\n\nIt's a remarkably self-aware comment, given Trump's frequent boasting of his wealth.\n\nA 1997 New Yorker profile of Trump details how the businessman liked to play Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1988 martial-arts film \"Bloodsport\" as an in-flight movie on his private jet, calling it \"an incredible, fantastic movie\" and an old favorite.\n\nTrump included Sergio Leone's 1966 spaghetti western in his list of favorite movies, as published by the BBC.\n\nTrump's love for violent films dominated the BBC list, which also featured Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 classic \"The Godfather.\"\n\nAnother gangster film, Martin Scorcese's acclaimed 1990 drama \"Goodfellas,\" made the list as well.\n\nAnd, in a surprising twist, Trump concluded the list with the 1939 historical romance \"Gone with the Wind.\"\n\nOutside of his own reality shows, Trump has been relatively tight-lipped about his favorite TV programs. He has, however, called NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" (on which he has also appeared) a guilty pleasure.\n\n\"My guilty pleasure TV show \u2014 'SNL,' starring me,\" Trump told People, following his second hosting appearance on the show, in 2015. \"They got great ratings. The best ratings in years. It was a terrific success. I enjoyed doing it. It was 50 percent more than Hillary [Clinton]'s show. That makes me feel good.\"\n\nIn a 2004 interview with the New York Post, Trump revealed that he liked Fox's short-lived reality show \"My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss,\" but only because it was a clear parody of him.\n\n\"I think it's an honor,\" Trump told the Post. \"We've been so successful with 'The Apprentice' that at least they have the guts to admit that it's a knockoff, a comedic knockoff.\"\n\nIn an interview with Megyn Kelly, Trump revealed that his favorite work of fiction is \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" a 1929 novel by German World War I veteran Erich Maria Remarque.\n\nOf course, Trump is known for frequently citing the Bible as \"the best\" book on the campaign trail, just ahead of his own 1987 business book \"The Art of the Deal.\"\n\nRolling Stone once spotted Trump at a Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concert at Madison Square Garden in 2006. Trump praised Neil Young afterward, telling the outlet, \"He's got something very special. I've listened to his music for years... His voice is perfect and haunting.\"\n\nThis year, Young protested Trump's use of his song \"Rockin' in the Free World\" on the campaign trail.\n\nYoung is a staunch liberal and an icon of the hippie movement \u2014 not exactly what one associates with Trump's current political movement. Interestingly, though, the two baby boomers are only one year apart in age.\n\nAccording to The New Yorker, Trump actually curates his own campaign rally playlists, so he's responsible for playing a number of Stones songs at his campaign rallies, including \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" \"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\" and \"Brown Sugar.\"\n\nAfter Trump used \"Start Me Up\" to follow his speech at the Republican National Convention, the band responded by asking that Trump \"cease all use\" of its music.\n\nTrump drew the ire of many for using Queen's \"We Are the Champions\" throughout his campaign without seeking the band's permission \u2014 most notably as his flashy RNC entrance song.\n\n\"We are frustrated by the repeated unauthorized use of the song after a previous request to desist, which has obviously been ignored by Mr. Trump and his campaign,\" the band said in a statement following the RNC.\n\nElton John's songs \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Rocket Man\" have appeared frequently at Donald Trump's rallies since he announced his run for the presidency in June 2015.\n\nJohn protested Trump's use of his songs to The Guardian following the Iowa caucuses, saying, \"It's nothing personal... I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f---ing Nugent? Or one of those f---ing country stars? They'll do it for you.\"\n\nDee Snider, the lead singer of the metal band Twisted Sister, initially allowed Donald Trump to use the band's 1984 hit \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" at his rallies, and Trump made it the anthem of his campaign.\n\nHowever, in May, Snider rescinded his agreement with Trump.\n\n\"I had to ask him to stop using the song,\" Snider told Billboard. \"I said, 'I didn't realize some of the things you were going to represent \u2014 the wall, banning Muslims. I can't get behind some of these things,' and he said 'OK' and stopped using it and that was it.\"\n\nRELATED: Politicians who refuse to support Trump\n\nABC NEWS - 7/20/16 - Coverage of the 2016 Republican National Convention from the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, which airs on all ABC News programs and platforms.

    "text": "On my fifth birthday, which I celebrated in Washington, DC, where I spent part of my childhood, I received a cowboy outfit, which gave me so much pleasure that I can still remember its every fashion detail. There was a tasselled tan waistcoat, a shining sheriff\u2019s star, a brown and white holster and a golden, long-barrelled gun. There was also an extravagant, wide-brimmed hat, half a pint passing for ten gallons, which I refused to take off for the entire day.\n\nYounger readers may be surprised to know that I also received a second world war flak jacket, a scaled-down section of the Pacific fleet with detachable torpedoes, and a handful of grenades. I was a one-boy arsenal for the day. But these were different times. It was 1963, months before the JFK assassination, and there was a commonly shared moral clarity about the link between bearing arms, and the benign results of firing them. Guns were for good guys. It was the way they established order, brought civilisation to hitherto savage parts, vanquished wrong-doers. It was the American myth. And nothing suited the myth better than the western movie, where reluctantly violent heroes wrought havoc to bring harmony, and those beautiful cowboy outfits.\n\nThough I might have dreamed of such a thing, I could not have known that, a decade-and-a-half later, I would nearly be in a western. Not any western, but the western that brought westerns to an end. A student at Oxford, I had heard that Michael Cimino was shooting some scenes for his new film in the university grounds and rushed to volunteer as an extra. Cimino was riding high on the success of The Deer Hunter (1978), and word on the gilded streets was that he was now making a western. He had wanted to shoot a scene at Harvard but was refused permission, so naturally he flew cast, crew and creative juices to Oxford, which, even as a student, struck me as extravagant.\n\nI missed the audition for immortal extrahood (long story) but my accounting instincts proved spot on. Heaven\u2019s Gate (1980) became the most notorious financial disaster in cinema history, bringing down a studio, Cimino\u2019s reputation, the very principle of directorial authorship, and the most resilient cinematic genre in Hollywood\u2019s history. Westerns died in the wake of Heaven\u2019s Gate. Although the film has been critically rehabilitated, I can barely watch it, firstly for its eerily apposite elegiac tone, and secondly for the surreal spottings of my former college mates (at least one is now a banker) in the film\u2019s majestic opening sequence.\n\nEvery so often, the western tries to make a comeback. This week sees the UK opening of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Django Unchained, a western set in the antebellum south, that is as far from Cimino\u2019s solemn work as one can imagine. Slick, saucy and ultra- violent, Django Unchained is a jangle of trademark Tarantino touches, mashing up Wagnerian love story, bloody revenge fable, and a morality tale on the evils of slavery.\n\nDjango\u2019s eponymous hero, played by Jamie Foxx, is given his freedom by a well-intentioned bounty hunter in return for helping him stalk his prey. Django lives out a fantasy life, riding into southern plantations, confronting white racist landowners, outquipping them, outgunning them. \u201cI wanted to give black American males a western hero, a cool, folkloric hero who could actually be empowering,\u201d said Tarantino in a Channel 4 News interview last week, moments before he appeared (remember: all is style with Tarantino) to lose his temper with his interviewer, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, who kept pressing him on why he thought there was no link between real and cinematic violence. (The exchange has become a YouTube hit, and is almost certainly the first time a Channel 4 News presenter has been told: \u201cI am shutting your butt down!\u201d)\n\nThere is a scene in Django that helps us understand why westerns no longer have any traction in contemporary culture. A Ku Klux Klan mob is out to capture Django and his German-born patron Dr King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Tarantino gives the scene a terrifying splendour and plays the \u201cDies Irae\u201d from Verdi\u2019s Requiem for added effect. It could, at a pinch, be taken from a classic John Ford film. But then one of the mob\u2019s number complains that he can\u2019t see out of his hood\u2019s eye-holes. Some of his fellow Klansmen agree with him; others don\u2019t. The scene is played entirely for laughs, Tarantino at his most knowing, and his most irritating.\n\nThis is not how westerns were meant to be. Westerns were the mythological touchstone of American values. They were not to be played for laughs. The moral dilemmas of stiff-backed loners in haunted landscapes were the stories that helped define a young nation that was at once super-confident and existentially uncertain. Gary Cooper\u2019s marshal in High Noon, Alan Ladd\u2019s Shane: these were the world-weary gunfighters who symbolised the long and lonesome struggle to bring order to chaos.\n\nThe country debated with itself in those grand canyons and dusty saloon bars. \u201cAmerican westerns have simple but eloquent stories; America is a simple but eloquent nation,\u201d said the comedian Rich Hall in his perceptive 2008 BBC documentary How the West was Lost.\n\nAmerican mythology was forged in the early part of the 20th century, in the overlapping years between the final days of the Wild West and the beginnings of Hollywood. Some of the west\u2019s most fabled characters realised that the overlap could be fruitful: the famous lawman and Nietzsche-lookalike Wyatt Earp was a deft handler of his own public relations, while Buffalo Bill\u2019s stage show, which the bison-hunting showman took to London and Paris in the 1880s, was an object lesson in how to dramatise the life of a cowboy, and an inspiration for early filmmakers, whose uncomplicated take on subjects such as the Great Train Robbery found mass appeal.\n\nIt is both a boon and a curse for American civilisation to be the only one mythologised in modern popular culture. In a fledgling nation, this art form immediately resonated with a public anxious to establish an ethical code. The frontier: beautiful metaphor, scary place. America needed its heroes to be better, and badder, than the baddest guys in town. It needed expert gunslingers to persuade people that their future prosperity should not depend on guns. In that respect, the cowboy was a self-destructive hero, which doubly ennobled him.\n\nBut the symbiosis between America and its fables also posed a problem. Westerns lacked the gravitas of the centuries-old mythologies. The Greeks don\u2019t mess about with Aeschylus. The words of Confucius continue to weigh heavily on the Chinese. But westerns, like all great popular art forms, swayed with the times. They were malleable, able to reflect subtle changes in social attitudes. The taciturn heroes of the 1930s turned into the light-hearted rebels of the 1970s\u2019 Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and then the redemption-seeking outlaw of Clint Eastwood\u2019s Unforgiven. Westerns found themselves unable to remain constant in their moral viewpoints.\n\nAround the time that I was waving my golden gun around the house, the western had already begun to mutate into something more than a simple morality tale. In Ford\u2019s The Searchers, released in 1956 and still present in the lists of all-time greats, John Wayne played an ill-tempered racist with designs on his brother\u2019s wife. In the early 1960s, Hud (1963) and The Misfits (1961) delved into the dark side of cowboy culture in their deconstruction of cowboy heroism.\n\nThe growing sophistication of the western did not go unnoticed among cinephiles, particularly those based in Europe. French intellectuals, easily seduced by girls and guns, became the western\u2019s most eloquent supporters. \u201cThe evaluation of a western shares something in common with wine-tasting,\u201d wrote the film critic Andr\u00e9 Bazin, sounding like a parody, in the New Wave journal Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in 1956. \u201cThe wine-lover alone can discern the body and the bouquet, the alcohol content and the fruitiness, and all these nuances intermingled, where the uninitiated can only make a rough guess at whether it is a Burgundy or a Bordeaux.\u201d\n\nThe snobbery was breathtaking: old Europe asserting its special insight into assessing the new nation\u2019s growing pains. But the western was faced with a dilemma: it could adapt with the fast-changing times, but lose its vernacular appeal and visceral potency; or it could keep telling the same old story. Mel Brooks\u2019s satirical Blazing Saddles (1974) hinted that the story was getting a little ridiculous; and Heaven\u2019s Gate showed what could happen in the rarefied air of high art: nobody came to see your film.\n\nIt is in this chilly limbo that Tarantino places his new film. Of course he tries to have it all ways: to raise important social history issues, such as slavery, that remain scandalously under-debated; but also to revel in the post-western jokes that seek our acknowledgment that the genre is as barren as its remote landscapes.\n\nThe spat with Guru-Murthy did not come out of a vacuum. Last month the Hollywood premiere of Django Unchained was postponed out of respect for the shootings at Sandy Hook school, which killed 26 people. Here was some kind of link between cowboy violence and real violence: a recognition, at least, that sprays of cinematic blood are not what people want to see when true blood has been shed.\n\nBut the nature of that link, which Tarantino so vehemently refused to address, is part of the story of the western today. Is it OK to celebrate the triumph of gun law, even when it asserts itself on the side of goodness? It is said that George W Bush\u2019s favorite film is High Noon, the ultimate a man\u2019s-got-to-do-what-a-man\u2019s- got-to-do parable. Should it concern us when his foreign policy statements seemed to be lifted from that powerful but simplistic movie\u2019s screenplay?\n\nThe US has spent a tortured century reassessing its views on native Americans, African Americans, gun crime, slavery, sexism and racism. The original westerns - The Great Train Robbery, Jesse James - which did not consider any of those areas to be problematic, gradually transformed into something that helped shape a nation\u2019s conscience. That was to their credit. But they have been overtaken by events. They are little more than a memory bank of images now, telling the story of that century with urgency and lyricism. None more poignant than John Wayne, holding up the Comanche-raised Natalie Wood at the end of The Searchers, whom he has vowed to kill, but finally decides to carry away from the guns, into the safe embrace of a peaceful home.\n\nPeter Aspden is the FT\u2019s arts writer.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2013\n\n(c) 2013 The Financial Times Limited",

But construct it on the 1967 borders, not Palestinian land \u2014 and especially not where it divides Palestinian farmers from their land.\n\nWhile I do condemn this type of violence, it pales in contrast to Palestinian suicide bombers, rockets and other acts of terror against Jews. (Jay)\n\nB\u2019Tselem, the Israeli human rights organization, reports that a total of 123 Israeli minors have been killed by Palestinians since the second intifada began in 2000, compared with 951 Palestinian minors killed by Israeli security forces.\n\nTo withdraw from the West Bank without a partner on the Palestinian side will find Israel in the same fix it has once it withdrew from Gaza: a rain of daily rockets. Yes, the security barrier causes hardship, but terrorist attacks have almost disappeared. That means my kids can ride the bus, go to unguarded restaurants and not worry about being blown up on their way to school. Find another way to keep my kids safe, and I\u2019ll happily tear down the barrier. (Laura)\n\nThis is the argument that I have the most trouble countering. Laura has a point: The barrier and checkpoints have reduced terrorism. But as presently implemented, they \u2014 and the settlements \u2014 also reduce the prospect of a long-term peace agreement that is the best hope for Laura\u2019s children.\n\nIf Israel were to stop the settlements, ease the checkpoints, allow people in and out more freely, and negotiate more enthusiastically with Syria over the Golan Heights and with the Arab countries on the basis of the Saudi peace proposal, then peace might still elude the region. But Israel would at least be doing everything possible to secure its long-term future, rather than bolstering Hamas.\n\nIf there is no two-state solution, there will be a one-state solution \u2014 and given demographic trends, that will mean either the end of Israeli democracy or the end of the Jewish state. Zionists should be absolutely clamoring for a Palestinian state.\n\nLaura is right about the need for a sensible Palestinian partner, and the failures of Palestinian leadership have been legion. At the moment, though, Israel has its most reasonable partner ever \u2014 Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas \u2014 and it is undermining him with its checkpoints and new settlement construction.\n\nPeace-making invariably involves exasperating and intransigent antagonists and unequal steps, just as it did in the decades in which Britain struggled to end terrorism emanating from Northern Ireland. But London never ordered air strikes on Sinn Fein or walled in Catholic neighborhoods. Over time, Britain\u2019s extraordinary restraint slowly changed attitudes so as to make the eventual peace possible.\n\nI hope Mr. Obama, as a candidate or as a president, will be a true enough friend of Israel to say all this, warmly but firmly.",

No one will argue that he\u2019s not among the greatest players of his generation, and after shedding the best-to-never-win-a-title tag over the last couple seasons, there\u2019s little the 29-year-old has left to do but build upon his own impressive legacy.\n\n*By clicking \"SUBSCRIBE\", you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nThat\u2019s not enough, however, to convince Kareem Abdul-Jabbar that James deserves to be listed among the all-time greats, a stance Abdul-Jabbar made abundantly clear in a recent interview with Los Angeles Daily News.\n\n\u201cLeBron James was talking about how he\u2019s the best ever, but he never saw Wilt play,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar told the paper. \u201cIf he had, he wouldn\u2019t say that. Whenever he averages 55 points a game, then I might want to listen to what he has to say. I\u2019m not trying to put LeBron down. He\u2019s awesome. He\u2019s the best player in this era at this point. But he didn\u2019t see Bill Russell play. When his team wins eight consecutive NBA championships, maybe I\u2019ll compare him to Bill Russell.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like Abdul-Jabbar is defending Russell more than he is demeaning LeBron \u2014 though Russell defended himself just fine when the topic of LeBron\u2019s Mount Rushmore came up. But then Kareem took things a step further, putting LeBron\u2019s knowledge of hoops history on blast.\n\n\u201cWhat if LeBron had to guard Elgin Baylor? I don\u2019t know if LeBron would\u2019ve had a good night that night,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said. \u201cThose days, you could hand-check and the game was more physical. Now you can\u2019t do those things and you can (carry the ball when you dribble) now. We couldn\u2019t do that. It was a more difficult game to play. I don\u2019t think he gets it in terms of the great athletes that have played this game.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly why Abdul-Jabbar got so hot and bothered about who was or was not included on LeBron\u2019s theoretical and completely arbitrary list.\n\nJames had been put on the spot with the question, his list was acceptable \u2014 made up mostly of players from the generation James grew up watching \u2014 and it\u2019s doubtful he meant any disrespect to Russell, Baylor or any of the other all-time greats Kareem mentioned to the Daily News, a list that included Jerry West, Earl Monroe, Dave Bing and Gus Johnson.\n\nHonestly, you could probably ask the 10 best players in the league about their Mount Rushmore and get 10 different answers, and they\u2019d all be right \u2014 and that\u2019s kind of the point of these hypotheticals, really. But if answering those sorts of questions is going to continue to prove as divisive as it has, players like James might just be best served to keep their opinions to themselves.\n\n\u2022 Outspoken Wizards center Marcin Gortat said that sometimes the team is mentally weak.\n\n\u2022 Ted Turner says he wouldn\u2019t have moved the Braves to Cobb County.\n\n\u2022 Bill Murray rocks some PBR pants:\n\n\u2022 The San Antonio Spurs mascot lost his eyes in a run-in with Aaron Brooks:\n\n\u2022 Warriors assistant Brian Scalabrine was reportedly demoted after getting into a verbal altercation with a fellow assistant.\n\n\u2022 Metta World Peace hopes Phil Jackson will be his ticket back to the Knicks\u2019 roster.\n\n\u2022 Ah, yes, NHL great Magic Johnson:\n\n\u2022 Witness the 2-minute drill through the eyes of Miami quarterback Ryan Williams:\n\n\u2022 A freshman receiver at Nevada is in ICU with a brain infection.\n\n\u2022 Former West Virginia quarterback Pat White is now an Edmonton Eskimo.\n\n\u2022 The University of Minnesota is set to build a $70 million practice facility for the football team.\n\n\u2022 Watch a Korean journalist prove that, yes, getting hit by a pitch hurts:\n\n\u2022 Reno Aces manager Phil Nevin made a guarantee that the temperature would be above 60 degrees on Opening Day, and put free tickets on the line.\n\n\u2022 Former Miami Marlins hitting coach Tino Martinez still thinks the team is soft.\n\n\u2022 Bryce Harper talked about the lengths he goes to in order to take care of his body.\n\n\u2022 John Calipari and Rick Pitino sure seem cozy:\n\n\u2022 Sports on Earth made a documentary about Rick Barry and the underhanded free throw:\n\n\u2022 Tom Coughlin says he deserves Hall of Fame consideration.\n\n\u2022 When asked why Patty Mills didn\u2019t play much before this year, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said it because Mills \u201cwas a little fat ass.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Tara Reid says she has kissed Tom Brady:\n\n\u2022 Apparently not everyone believed that the Johnny Manziel dunking video was filmed using a 10-foot rim, so he posted another one to try to prove his case:\n\n\u2022 Carl Pelini is finally speaking out about the controversy that led to his resignation at FAU.\n\n\u2022 An MLS player missed a game after he suffered a concussion tripping over a bike rack.\n\n\u2022 The Brewers will be giving away a Hank the Dog bobblehead this season:\n\n\u2022 Jorge Gutierrez was ejected for this foul on Cody Zeller:\n\n\u2022 Rajon Rondo will fill in as a color analyst for an upcoming Celtics game.\n\n\u2022 Derek Jeter is No. 11 on Forbes\u2019 list of the world\u2019s greatest leaders.\n\n\u2022 Nick Young is not concerned with calories when he stops at the movie theater concession stand:\n\n\u2022 George H.W.

    "text": "Cash-strapped states are forgoing a total of roughly $1 billion annually in tax revenue because of little-noticed laws that permit retailers to keep a slice of the sales taxes they collect for the government, according to a new study.\n\nLaws in 26 states, largely dating to the era before computerized cash registers, allow retailers to keep a small portion of sales-tax revenue they collect to compensate them for the expense of gathering the funds. Thirteen of those states impose no ceiling on the total amount kept by retailers.\n\nGood Jobs First, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit research group that is often critical of tax subsidies for large corporations, examined data on such compensation plans.\n\nThe report comes as many states are facing their most severe budget pressure in years. Adjusted for inflation, state tax revenues were down 2.6% in the most recent quarter, according to a report released this month by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. States are looking to fill multibillion-dollar budget gaps through a variety of tax increases and service cuts, including tightening Medicaid eligibility and raising tuition at public colleges.\n\n\"There may be times when states are flush, when they can afford to let this leakage happen, but now that the states are facing a squeeze, we think they need to take a closer and harder look at this revenue loss,\" said Philip Mattera, the report's lead author and research director at Good Jobs First.\n\nThe study found that the state with the highest gross giveback was Illinois, which has no cap on the amount it permits vendors to keep, and forewent $126 million in sales-tax revenue in 2007.\n\nA spokesman for the Illinois revenue department said it had attempted over the years to get legislators to cap the compensation program. The initiatives failed amid opposition from retailers.\n\nOther states with no ceilings also forfeited substantial sums: Texas, $90 million; Pennsylvania, $72 million; and Colorado, $69 million.\n\nTo be sure, the taxes foregone represent a tiny sliver of the total sales tax collected in the 26 states, which was $146.4 billion in 2007, according to the Good Jobs First analysis.\n\nMost of the information for the study came from publicly available data or from estimates based on state tax collections, the group said. The study was funded in part by an outside foundation that generally finances liberal causes, including labor and environmental issues.\n\nMaureen Riehl, government and industry relations counsel for the National Retail Federation, said it costs retailers money to collect the tax for states, and they should be compensated for \"doing the state or local government's business for them.\" She added that states without such programs should implement them.\n\nA 2006 survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP estimated that the average net cost to retailers of collecting sales taxes was 3.1% of the sum collected. That ranged from 13.5% of the tax collected for small retailers to 2.2% for large retailers.\n\nWal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, kept about $60 million last year through the 26 states' vendor-compensation programs, the study estimates.\n\nThe estimate was based on sales-tax data Wal-Mart makes available on its Web site. Good Jobs First often has been critical of Wal-Mart, including its efforts to reduce its property taxes, and has received funding for one of its research projects from a labor union also critical of Wal-Mart.\n\nA Wal-Mart spokesman declined to comment.\n\nTo put the overall expenses into some context, the $90 million forgone in Texas is roughly the same as total state funding of $82.6 million for the state's main pre-kindergarten program, according to Don Baylor Jr., a senior policy analyst for the Center for Public Policy Priorities.\n\nThe compensation formulas for retailers are generally complex, often providing for a sliding percentage that declines as the vendor collects more tax.\n\nMr. Mattera of Good Jobs First said states should consider instituting caps to eliminate \"windfalls\" for giant retailers.\n\nWrite to Jesse Drucker at jesse.drucker@wsj.com",

In the late 1960s, when the Japanese artist was living and working in New York City, she staged numerous happenings and body festivals like \u201cAnatomic Explosion,\u201d which featured masked performers dressed in little more than hand-painted polka dots. She also had her own clothing shop, at 404 Sixth Avenue, where she sold various items of her own design. Here again, polka dots and nudity were a leitmotif with the racier garments featuring strategically placed cutouts around the breasts, crotch and buttocks.\n\nMostly Kusama is known for her mind-bending interiors or \u201cworlds\u201d resplendent with polka dots of varying sizes, in a combination of red and white or yellow and black. The artist favors garments that allow her to blend in with these fantastic roomscapes, and in many installation photographs you can barely pick her out, one lone dot among millions.\n\nWhen \u201cYayoi Kusama,\u201d a major traveling retrospective, opens on Thursday at the Whitney Museum, visitors can also dress to blend in with the work. Kusama has a new line of clothing and accessories, in collaboration with Louis Vuitton, including dresses, pants, tops, scarves, bags, shoes, sunglasses and a watch, all in her now widely recognized signature dots. The collection is available beginning tomorrow at Louis Vuitton stores and at a special Kusama pop-up shop in SoHo, her old stomping ground. There are no strategic cutouts that we could find, but a see-through plastic and red polka dot minitrench is just what the avant-gardist ordered.\n\nThe Yayoi Kusama for Louis Vuitton pop-up shop will open July 10 at 4 p.m. at 116 Greene Street.",

Ann and I join the president and first lady and all Americans in offering our deepest condolences to those whose lives were shattered in a few moments, a few moments of evil in Colorado,\u201d Romney told a few hundred people gathered at a lumber yard here.\n\n\u201cI stand before you today not as a man running for office but as a father and grandfather, a husband, an American. This is a time for each of us to look into our hearts and remember how much we love one another and how much we love and how much we care for our great country. There\u2019s so much love and goodness in the heart of America.\u201d\n\nRomney, wearing a navy blue suit and blue tie, spoke for four minutes. The trademark campaign banners with slogans such as \u201cBelieve in America\u201d or \u201cObama\u2019s Upside-Down Economy\u201d were gone, leaving a handful of American flags as the backdrop. Before Romney spoke, Father Christian Tutor, an Anglican Catholic priest, led a prayer. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte introduced Romney.\n\n\u201cJoe and I want to offer our thoughts and prayers from the people of New Hampshire to the victims in Aurora, Colo., to their families,\u201d she said, speaking for herself and her husband.\n\nRomney, who has five children and 18 grandchildren, focused on the young victims and the talents and opportunities lost.\n\n\u201cThis morning Colorado lost youthful voices which would have brightened their homes, enriched their schools and brought joy to their families,\u201d Romney said. \u201cOur prayer is that the comforter might bring the peace to souls that surpasses our understanding.\u201d\n\nHe said the victims and their families are not only being comforted by their neighbors, but by all Americans.\n\n\u201cGrieving and worried families in Aurora are surrounded by love today and not just by those who are with them and holding them in their arms. They can also know they are being lifted up in prayer by people in every part of our great nation,\u201d he said. \u201cNow and in the hard days to come may every one of them feel the sympathy of our whole nation and the comfort of a loving god.\u201d\n\nHe urged Americans to come together and focus on one another.\n\n\u201cThere will be justice for those responsible. That\u2019s another matter for another day,\u201d Romney said. \u201cToday is a moment to grieve and to remember, to reach out and to help, to appreciate our blessings in life. Each one of us will hold our kids a little closer, linger a bit longer with a colleague or a neighbor, reach out to a family member or a friend. We\u2019ll all spend a little less time thinking about the worries of our day and more time wondering about how to help those who are in need of compassion the most.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe answer is we can come together to show our fellow citizens the good heart of America we know and love,\u201d he concluded. \u201cGod bless you for being here and sharing together this moment of sorrow and God bless the United States of America.\u201d\n\nAfterward, Romney and Ayotte shook the hand of every person as they left.",

    "text": "Hilary Kramer is the founder and chief investment officer of A&G Capital Research. She tells Wallace Forbes, president of the Forbes Investors' Advisory Institute, that the best way to invest in the global markets now is to look toward U.S.-based companies.\n\nWallace Forbes: What are your thoughts on how interconnected we have become throughout the world? What does that represent in the way of opportunities as well as dangers for individual investors?\n\nIt's no longer just American markets and companies that are broadly available to individual investors. Also, many U.S. companies are international in nature and actually for many earnings are more and more dependent on their international operations than they are on their U.S. operations. Do you have any comments on what you're doing in terms of looking more worldwide for investment opportunities?\n\nHilary Kramer: For me, it's looking for some of the U.S. based companies that are going to serve the international market, especially the emerging markets and health care, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment on telecommunication side. So that's the perspective I had. Plus, I look for the U.S. companies that a foreign company would want to own. That's why a Williams or an El Paso ( EP - news - people ) in natural gas, you know, look out. They could be a nice acquisition target. So I try to figure that way who wants footholds and who really has the money.\n\nAlso I find that it's very interesting, there are companies like Veolia Environment ( VE - news - people ), an old French company, established in the 1850s. Great dividend yield, good company to own if you're going to own it for 20 years. Actually an excellent company to own. But I know so many investors including institutional investors that are saying, \"I have to have Veolia. I have to have Veolia.\" It does it clean up, contracts and builds water systems and filtration projects all over the world.\n\nBut right now it has everything that you don't want to own. It's in all those areas. And so it's very easy to get sold on international. But I think that the U.S. based stocks are really the place to be right now, especially with the flight to safety, equities in the U.S. ( \"Watch: Buy Evercore And Cowen.\")\n\nFollow Intelligent Investing On Twitter.\n\nSign Up For The Daily Intelligent Investing Newsletter.",

The top 15 drivers with the most wins over the first 26 races will earn a spot in the NASCAR Chase Grid -- provided they have finished in the top 30 in points and attempted to qualify for every race (except in rare instances). The 16th Chase position will go to the points leader after race No. 26, if he/she does not have a victory. In the event that there are 16 or more different winners over 26 races, the only winless driver who can earn a Chase grid spot would be the points leader after 26 races.\n\nIf there are fewer than 16 different winners in the first 26 races, the remaining Chase grid positions will go to those winless drivers highest in points. If there are 16 or more winners in the first 26 races, the ties will first be broken by number of wins, followed by NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver points.\n\nAs has been the case in recent seasons, at the close of the regular season, drivers who qualify for the Chase will have their point totals reset to 2,000 plus 3 points for each regular-season race victory. Winless drivers receive no bonus points.\n\nAfter the first three races of the Chase -- known as the Challenger Round -- the bottom four Chase drivers in points will be eliminated from championship eligibility, leaving 12 drivers to fight for the title. Any driver who wins a Chase race automatically advances to the next segment. Points will be reset after this round to 3,000 points for each driver.\n\nFollowing the next three races of the Chase -- the Contender Round -- the bottom four remaining drivers again will be eliminated, cutting the title hopefuls to eight. Points will be reset to 4,000 for each driver after this round.\n\nAfter another three races -- the Eliminator Round -- the bottom four remaining drivers will be axed, leaving four drivers to contend for the championship.\n\nAt the season finale, the final four drivers will have their point totals reset to 5,000 so all four are tied prior to the Ford 400. Whoever among the four drivers does best at Homestead will be the series champion for the year.\n\n\"No math, no bonus points for leading laps, (or) previous wins,\" said France. \"It's going to be the first of four drivers to cross the finish line. And you know what? That's as simple as it gets.\"\n\nAdditionally, drivers who are eliminated in the Contender and Eliminator Rounds will have their points readjusted. Each eliminated driver will return to the Chase-start base of 2,000 (plus any regular season wins bonus points), with their accumulated points starting with race No. 27 added. This will allow all drivers not in contention for the NASCAR Sprint Cup title to continue to race for the best possible season-long standing, with final positions fifth through 16th still up for grabs.\n\n\"NASCAR's core responsibility is to always look down the road and position the industry to excite our fans with the highest level of competition in the world,\" said France. \" ... The new Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup will be thrilling, easy to understand and help drive our sport's competition to a whole new level.\"\n\nFrance said NASCAR had three goals in coming up with the new system: 1. Reward winning more. 2. Make running for a championship much easier to understand. 3. Expand the field of Chase drivers \"while ultimately rewarding the most worthy, battle-tested champion.\"\n\nAfter using a single points system from 1975 to 2003 that determined the Sprint Cup champion based on results for the entire season, NASCAR has now changed how its champion is determined four times in the last 11 years.\n\nNASCAR adopted the 10-race, season-ending Chase for the Sprint Cup in 2004. The sanctioning body expanded the Chase field from 10 to 12 drivers in 2007, and revamped the points system in 2011. The 2011 season ended with Tony Stewart and Carl Edwards tied in points, but Stewart taking the title by virtue of a tiebreaker for winning more races than Edwards.\n\nFrance said he figured that some fans won't like the new format, but said most would.\n\n\"We have millions of fans and we have some very loud and passionate fans, especially when we change anything. We understand that,\" France said. \"The vast majority of the fans that we communicated with, and I think we're the best in sports in staying close to our fan base, really love this. They love it because they really don't like points racing. At the end of the day, although consistency is important in our sport, and it remains important, it's just less important, so they like that. They understand winner\u2011take\u2011all formats, and they understand being the best down the stretch.\"",

Dow Corning had been betting heavily on the expansion of solar industry but the recent worsening macro-economic environment has already taken some of the sheen from the industry. Now the company fears that the expanding trade war between the U.S. and China over solar module production could crimp its revenues further. []\n\nWe currently have a $16.50 Trefis price estimate for Corning, which is around 30% ahead of the market price.\n\nSee our complete analysis of Corning\n\nMisplaced bet on solar industry expansion?\n\nIn the last few years, Dow Corning and Hemlock Semiconductor have announced investments of $5 billion to provide critical materials to the fast-growing solar technology industry. [] [] Both companies expected that the U.S. solar industry would take off by end-2011, but the market bludgeoned solar stocks this year indicating that companies hadn\u2019t factored in the present macro-economic challenges in their analyses.\n\nThe European Union has been the most ardent investor in solar power so threats to the euro zone\u2019s economies are indirect threats to solar. Severe austerity measures in Europe will threaten government support to the solar industry through subsidies which will hurt demand for the energy source if the cost is passed on to the consumers instead. Moreover, as cuts in government spending will cut government and commercial demand for solar power, the sector will increasingly rely on consumer demand, which will only recover if unemployment falls, wages recover, and confidence returns to the market both on the investor and consumer sides.\n\nU.S. China trade war to hurt Dow Corning\u2019s exports\n\nThe Chinese government has focused on increasing the competitiveness of its solar manufacturers through free or subsidized land from local governments, extensive tax breaks and other state assistance, which has reduced solar panel prices by 30 to 42 percent per kilowatt-hour last year. [] This has helped Chinese manufacturers make deep inroads into the U.S. and European markets as cheap prices supported increased exports. This prompted a United Steelworkers union complaint last year, asking the Obama administration to investigate China\u2019s clean energy subsidies and other policies and to bring cases against China at the World Trade Organization.\n\nMore recently, SolarWorld has filed case against Chinese solar manufacturers, alleging that Chinese trade practices have harmed American solar manufacturing. This has been endorsed by U.S. Trade Commission, paving the way for potential tariffs on Chinese solar panels sold in the United States. []\n\nOther solar manufacturers, including Dow Corning, fear that this will lead to Chinese backlash which will threaten America\u2019s polysilicon exports to China (which were worth $873 million last year) and local demand for solar products, and have requested SolarWorld to withdraw its case. [] [] But SolarWorld has rejected the request and persists in its demand for punitive duties on Chinese solar products. []\n\nRecently China slapped punitive duties on cars imported from the U.S. after the country failed to block U.S. tariffs on Chinese tires. This growing propensity toward politicization of trade spats between the U.S. and China can hurt Dow Corning\u2019s exports to China, which in turn will hurt Corning\u2019s equity earnings from the joint-venture.\n\nYou can drag the trend lines in the modifiable chart above to see the impact of these trends on Corning\u2019s stock value.\n\nUnderstand How a Company\u2019s Products Impact its Stock Price at Trefis\n\nLike our charts?

Zhan Jiang of the Kunming Industrial and Commercial Administration told the official China Daily that his agency had received complaints and would also look at the city\u2019s resellers as well as retail shops.\n\nApple Inc. has 13 authorized resellers in Kunming but no official stores. In China, it has two stores in Beijing and two in Shanghai.\n\nThe complaints came after a 27-year-old American woman relayed her experiences, on her BirdAbroad blog, about visiting three of the four near-perfect fake outlets, which had been opened by a company based in Shenzhen. The July 20 posting triggered an international media storm.\n\nSurprisingly, Apple has been mum about the stunning revelation. Representatives in both Beijing and Cupertino have declined to offer substantive comments. If someone opened a fake store in, say, Grand Central Station, the company would be blanketing the media with statements vowing to shut down the offending outlet.\n\nSo why would Apple, known for meticulous control of its supply chain, stay quiet when someone has invaded its distribution network in China? It is virtually inconceivable that Cupertino did not know of the four fake stores, the first of which opened in May. After all, how could one foreigner aimlessly strolling down the streets of Kunming with her husband find something that an obsessively protective company with hundreds of investigators and lawyers could not? Moreover, Apple had received a complaint about the fakes filed by a major authorized Kunming distributor.\n\nPerhaps Apple was trying to buy time to find out where the Shenzhen business was getting its wares. It has been reported that unauthorized sellers buy products from Apple\u2019s retail outlets in China and elsewhere and from shadowy networks smuggling goods into the country. Other products may be second-hand items or knock-offs. The only other possibility, which appears remote, is that Apple\u2019s contract manufacturers in China\u2014principally Foxconn\u2014have been selling product out their back doors.",

Surprisingly, some of the most susceptible employees in those attacks are software engineers who work in R&D labs. In other words, people who should really know better. Yet because these employees are accustomed to working in a test environment and not in production, said one Fortune 500 CEO recently, engineers tend not to take as much caution as other, more wary employees.\n\n\u201cEngineers tend to be really open,\u201d said Jeffery Funk, CIO at the department of general services for the State of California. That can mean they\u2019re less suspicious of unsolicited email messages that might really be a hacker in disguise, he noted.\n\nFurthermore, certain types of malicious email messages have become very sophisticated and don\u2019t immediately raise red flags like, say, an unsolicited email message advertising Viagra. Clicking on a link or an attachment can open the door for a hacker to start moving through the IT system looking for intellectual property to steal.\n\nSome of the most highly targeted intellectual property is about technology, including information systems, lasers, optics and sensors, electronics, aeronautics, armaments, as well as marine and space systems\u2014as it turns out, places where software engineers can be found in abundance\u2013according to a December 2012 report from the Defense Security Service, an agency within the Department of Defense.\n\n\u201cAll our peer companies are primary targets,\u201d said Ken Bell, CIO at Orbital Sciences Corp., which makes rockets and satellites. Bell says his company uses a variety of techniques, including filtering emails, anti-virus, restricting the execution of certain types of code, intrusion prevention, access controls and other methods, in attempts to prevent the theft of intellectual property from a cyber attack.",

    "text": "It's been a seemingly endless winter and you've just shoveled out your plowed-in car for the second time today. You're so ready for a vacation escape.\n\nThe home page for travel site Wanderfly.\n\nThe home page for travel site Wanderfly.\n\nAn ever-increasing number of travel-inspiration websites, or those with inspirational features as a sidelight \u2014 including Goby, Tripbase, Wanderfly and Cheapflights \u2014 now offer vacation, activity and entertainment recommendations based on personal preferences.\n\nMajor online travel agencies such as Travelocity and Expedia also offer vacation searching by theme, but they try to get you to the booking quickly. In contrast, most travel-inspiration websites are for people who have no clue where to go and are just beginning their research.\n\nThey let you insert your travel dates, decide if your priority is to hit the beach or catch some nightlife (or both), then offer personalized destination suggestions.\n\nThe travel-inspiration arena is branching out. This winter, Southwest Airlines has quietly launched the Southwest GetAway Finder, enabling you to search for destinations, Southwest flights and hotels based on your budget and desired vacation types. Wanderfly, a start-up, just added a concierge service and is working to integrate advice from your Facebook friends. Cheapflights recently added a \"Be inspired\" tab, arming travelers with the ability to search for destinations and flight deals based on preferred vacation or destination type.\n\nTo widely varying degrees, these travel-inspiration sites can point you toward destinations you might not otherwise have considered.\n\nWhat's more, they can provide detailed advice. Do you know the best trail to hike in the spring in Tennessee or the airline with the most Atlanta-to-Chicago flight delays? Some sites will tell you.\n\nHowever, a flaw with some is the disconnect between inspiring your vacation and enabling you to book it. For example, Wanderfly doesn't handle bookings and uses Kayak to search for flights. But, since Kayak doesn't process bookings, either, it transfers you to an airline or online travel agency website to purchase the ticket. For lodging search and booking, Wanderfly turns to Hotels.com\n\nOverview: Enables travelers to search for vacations in more than 1,200 destinations in 130 countries based on 20 trip types. Also recommends in-destination activities.\n\nPros: Wide choice of searchable trip types. You can save flight and hotel bookings to MyTrips. Preparing to integrate advice from your Facebook friends.\n\nCons: Destination descriptions can be flat and not travel-oriented. Results pages are busy and confusing. Activities listings, some sourced from Foursquare, may provide scant detail. Lists your Facebook friends \"near\" a destination, though sometimes they are hours away, and provides no meaningful way to interact with them.\n\nTakeaway: Disappointing, although it's only a few months old. Attempting to do too much; hasn't found a niche.\n\nOverview: Focuses on activities and entertainment, not destinations themselves, in \"virtually every ZIP code\" in the USA.\n\nPros: User-friendly interface. Comprehensive activities and entertainment information displayed without excessive ads. Ideal for parents mulling weekend plans with kids and travelers looking for in-destination activities. Lots of user reviews, photos and maps. \"Things to do near\" feature streamlines search by major city, showing top activities by category and upcoming events.\n\nCons: Activity descriptions occasionally lack detail. Sometimes a search result is not relevant: A query for outdoor recreation events near Springfield, N.J., provided a Brooklyn restaurant offering Philippines tours.\n\nTakeaway: A leader in the inspiration genre with great breadth of activities and events content. Less useful for \"vacation\" inspiration per se.\n\nOverview: Sorts 30,000 \"fly\" and \"drive\" destinations, skewed toward the USA and Europe, based on trip dates and types.\n\nPros: Packed with excellent destination information and analysis \u2014 \"Historically, United is the cheapest for this route, and Continental is the most expensive\" \u2014 as well as estimated costs from diverse sources. Plenty of photos and videos. Searching for vacations within your preferred driving distance is an attractive differentiator.\n\nCons: Vacation recommendations are based, in part, on a specified number of user reviews, but you are unable to read the reviews. Things to Do pages are cluttered with ads and an irrelevant promotion for Tripbase Travel Blog.\n\nTakeaway: Excellent for travel research; practical and insightful. At times the editorial quality is a tad dull.\n\nOverview: A new \"Be inspired tab\" enables flight search based on dates, budget, desired temperature at destination and vacation type (beaches, city break, family, adventure, ski & snow).\n\nPros: The look and feel are simple, clean and attractive. Broad array of airlines and online travel agencies offering flight deals and booking.\n\nCons: The \"Be inspired\" feature offers flight deals only \u2014 no hotels, activities or tours. No destination descriptions. The search option \"city break,\" a British term, doesn't translate for a U.S. audience.\n\nTakeaway: The \"Be inspired\" feature doesn't offer additional flight choices from those found elsewhere on the site; it simply provides them via a different kind of search.\n\nIs there a product, app or website you'd like the Digital Traveler to review?

The groundings led to more than 3,000 flight cancellations and the stranding of about 350,000 passengers, becoming the highest-profile problem in a two-month tempest over the FAA's oversight of airline maintenance practices.\n\nThe reports were delivered on May 2 to Transportation Secretary Mary Peters, who last month requested more information about the groundings.\n\nPeters said yesterday that she was going to ask the FAA and airlines to examine how they communicate in such situations to prevent similar debacles.\n\nAmerican grounded its MD-80s in mid-April in response to questions by FAA inspectors about whether the airline had properly inspected and repaired wire bundles in the planes' right-wheel wells. That work had been required by a safety rule that sought to mitigate the chances of sparking, fires and explosions.\n\nThe MD-80, a twin-engine jet that seats about 140 people, was manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, which later merged with Boeing.\n\nThe groundings came as the FAA was being criticized over lax oversight of airlines' compliance with safety mandates. Last year, the FAA improperly allowed Southwest Airlines to continue flying dozens of jets that were in need of safety checks. Members of Congress and outside experts have criticized the FAA over becoming too cozy with the airlines.\n\nBy late March, embarrassed by the publicity over the Southwest lapses, the FAA launched an audit of carriers' compliance with safety mandates. Inspectors chose to examine the rule requiring inspections and repairs of the MD-80s' wire bundles as part of that investigation, the FAA said.",

    "text": "Adrian Grenier needs to keep computer maker Dell honest.\n\nThe star of HBO\u2019s hit series \u201cEntourage\u201d recently became Dell\u2019s first \u201cSocial Good Advocate,\u201d making his debut in the role this week at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. Dell, which is based in the Austin area, hopes that Grenier will help draw more attention to the company\u2019s green initiatives, something that has become progressively harder for the company since it went private in 2013.\n\nGrenier has a track record of supporting and working for social causes, especially those focused on the environment. In 2008, Grenier and film-producer Peter Glatzer co-created \u201cAlter Eco,\u201d a television show for the Discovery Channel focused on sustainable living. The following year, the two created Shft, a website described as a \u201clifestyle platform\u201d to convey a more sustainable approach to film, design, art, and food. Grenier\u2019s latest eco project is a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to fund a film about whales and raise awareness of ocean noise pollution.\n\nDell recently published its Dell 2020 Legacy of Good Plan, in which the company lays out a number of social and environmental goals that it plans to tackle from now until the end of the decade. Some of the goals can be tracked relatively easily, such as the company\u2019s desire to reduce energy intensity on its product portfolio by 80% from 2013 levels and use only packaging that is 100% compostable.\n\nThen there\u2019s it\u2019s \u201cLegacy of Good\u201d goal in which the company is seeking to generate 10 times more benefit through their technology than it takes to make and use it.\n\nThe goals outlined in the sustainability plan are admirable and could produce significant cost savings for the company and social good for the planet if executed in the right way. But it won\u2019t be easy. Such changes are hard to make and require real investment and time from Dell. In a couple years or so, the company could very well choose to quietly bury the whole plan and pretend that it never existed.\n\nThis is where Grenier could make a real difference. Given the fluidity of his role, he can make it a point to keep track of Dell\u2019s progress and help prevent the company from shirking on its commitments. By standing up to Dell and making sure it sticks to its goals, Grenier could carve out a new legacy for himself and inspire more celebrities to take on similar roles in corporations across the country.\n\nI sat down with Grenier in Austin this week to discuss his new role and what he plans to accomplish. The following interview has been edited and condensed for publication.\n\nFortune: Why are you here at SXSW? Why did you think it was the appropriate venue to launch this partnership with Dell?\n\nAdrian Grenier: Well it\u2019s awesome, where else would you do it? I mean, is this not the perfect venue? It\u2019s a gathering of great minds, great ideas, and it\u2019s an opportunity to get everyone in the same space. So, besides all the fun we\u2019re gonna have, I think we can come together and make a difference.\n\nOkay, so Dell has named their Social Good Advocate. What exactly does that mean?\n\nIt means that I am going to help them not only spread the message of what they\u2019re doing, but also to change and shift their behaviors and their practices and their business to do better for the planet and for people. I also think it involves finding ways that we can bring people together and invite them to share their ideas so that we can double down on that good.\n\nWho approached who regarding a partnership with Dell?\n\nDell approached me. They said that they got a chance to explore my work with SHFT, Alter Echo, and a few of the other productions I had been a part of in the past. If you look at some of the work that Dell is doing right now around setting goals and trying to incubate ideas, it is really exciting. I thought it was a good blend to put our platforms together.\n\nI know you\u2019ve worked with big corporations in the past, like with Ford over at SHFT, correct?\n\nThat was a little bit different. Ford came out with a series of more sustainable vehicles\u2014electric and hybrid vehicles. And, through SHFT, we were able to let people know that this is yet another option consumers had to put their money towards; something that was actually better for the planet.\n\nDo you see yourself advocating for Dell\u2019s products?\n\nWell, I think a lot of things that Dell is doing is behind the scenes, such as with its packaging. Dell is committed to making a significant measurable impact in how they do business so that consumers can feel better about buying products from Dell.\n\nCan you talk a little bit more about the packaging?\n\nI\u2019m learning that this package [holding up a cardboard looking box] is made from wheat-straw, which is pretty cool. It acts just like cardboard, so you know the fibers are the same as tree fibers, except it\u2019s a highly renewable resource. In China, they would actually burn the wheat straw so it would contribute more CO2 to the planet. So it actually reduces that element. It\u2019s also \u2026 creating an industry to actually process and make this new type of material out of the wheat straw. Oh, and it is cheaper too!\n\nSo, some might say this is nothing but typical corporate \u201cgreenwashing\u201d and that Dell doesn\u2019t really care about the environment. It just wants to sell more products to eco-conscious customers.\n\nWell \u2026 let\u2019s hold them to it. I\u2019m not an employee of Dell. I\u2019m an independent, free-thinking person, and I also have my own reputation to maintain. Believe it or not, I did a lot of research to make sure that this was for real. But you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t think we should take anything for granted, and there is a lot of greenwashing out there. So let\u2019s actually hold Dell to their goals and let\u2019s help them achieve their goals too.",

(AP/File)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2013 Chiefs safety Eric Berry has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease and will begin chemotherapy for what doctors called a \"very treatable and potentially curable\" form of cancer.\n\nBerry had been undergoing tests at Emory University in Atlanta since an MRI exam nearly two weeks ago showed a mass on the right side of his chest. At the time, doctors were still uncertain whether the mass was cancerous, but further testing revealed the lymphoma.\n\nDr. Christopher Flowers, who directs the lymphoma program at Emory's Winship Cancer Institute, said Monday that Berry will undergo \"standard chemotherapy approaches\" to treat the disease. Flowers did not provide a timetable or prognosis for recovery.\n\n\"The goal of Mr. Berry's treatment is to cure his lymphoma and we are beginning that treatment now,\" Flowers said in a statement issued through the Chiefs.\n\nHodgkin's disease, also called Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a cancer of the immune system that only represents about 8 percent of all diagnosed lymphomas. According to the National Cancer Institute, more than 9,000 people will be diagnosed with it in the United States this year.\n\nThe survival rate in 1960 was about 40 percent, but advancements in medicine combined with earlier detections have increased the survival rate to more than 80 percent.\n\n\"I want to thank the Emory University School of Medicine, along with Dr. Flowers and his team, for all of their hard work and effort in diagnosing and creating a plan for me to battle this thing,\" Berry said in a statement. \"I will embrace this process and attack it the same way I do everything else in life. God has more than prepared me for it.\"\n\nHall of Fame hockey player Mario Lemieux was diagnosed with the same disease in 1993, at the height of his career. He underwent radiation and other treatment and missed about two months, and later took a leave of absence. But he ultimately returned to the Pittsburgh Penguins to finish his career.\n\nLemieux also founded the Mario Lemiuex Foundation, which funds medical research projects while supporting numerous organizations, including the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.\n\nCubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo was also diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2008 and was successfully treated with chemotherapy. He was voted to his first All-Star game this past season.\n\nBerry first began feeling discomfort in his chest during a loss in Oakland on Nov. 20. The pain persisted when he showed up at the team's training facility the following day, and he immediately went through a battery of tests that included an MRI exam and CT scan. The mass was discovered that night, and Berry informed his teammates a few days later before heading to Atlanta.\n\nThe Chiefs have lost both of their games since Berry was placed on the season-ending non-injury list, putting them in peril of missing the playoffs. Kansas City (7-6) has games remaining against the Raiders, Pittsburgh and San Diego, the latter two teams also in the playoff hunt.\n\nBerry has received widespread support since the news of his plight became public.\n\nThe New York Jets tweeted Monday, \"Our thoughts are with Eric Berry, his family & Chiefs Nation,\" while #berrystrong has been trending on Twitter.\n\nBerry's alma mater, Tennessee, wore helmet stickers honoring him in a recent game, and the Chiefs designed a shirt that reads, \"Be Bold Be Brave Be Berry.\" Arizona coach Bruce Arians wore one of the shirts before the Cardinals' game against the Chiefs, and they are being sold online and at Arrowhead Stadium with proceeds going to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\n\n\"My family and I are very grateful for the amount of support we have received over the last couple of weeks,\" Berry said. \"I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate all the words of encouragement, the blessings and well wishes.\"",

    "text": "(See Corrections & Amplifications items below.)\n\nThe dire economy could make it harder to enjoy the great outdoors.\n\nFrom Nevada to New York, state parks across the country are facing budget cuts -- in some cases steep ones -- just as they are anticipating another busy season. Officials in several states say there will be less money to employ workers to clear trail brush or repair footpaths. Restrooms will be shuttered. Some lakes and pools will be closed weekdays, or altogether. Some parks will have shorter seasons or curtailed hours, or bar the public from eating at certain picnic areas or sunbathing on certain beaches.\n\nThe Maid of the Mist at the base of Niagara Falls. The visitor center at Niagara Falls State Park in New York will cut its hours and days of operation.\n\nThe economic downturn has led to lower tax revenues for most states, and federal stimulus money can't be used to patch holes in state operating budgets.\n\n\"It's rare if a state is not having pretty serious problems,\" said Philip K. McKnelly, the executive director of the National Association of State Park Directors. He said many states expect their parks budgets will be cut 10% to 15% from the year before.\n\nThe hits to state parks are unfolding a year after skyrocketing gas prices kept people close to home, leading to a record number of visitors at state trails, lakes and pools. This year, while gas prices are expected to be lower, families that are nervous about job losses and conserving money are expected to flock to state parks, where a day's outing is typically far cheaper than one at a private amusement park.\n\nNew York state's legislature recently approved a $172 million parks budget, $28 million less than in the current fiscal year. That has forced park officials to cut park hours and visitors' services from Niagara Falls on the Canadian border to Jones Beach on Long Island.\n\nGeorgia lawmakers, who have shaved millions of dollars from parks budgets in recent years, recently approved $17 million in appropriations for the fiscal year starting July 1, $10 million less than the current year's spending. State-run pools won't open this summer, said Kim Hatcher, a parks spokeswoman. The state will entertain proposals from private companies interested in running the golf courses and camp lodges.\n\nSome Georgia residents in this down economy are balking at the higher costs that private companies charge at state parks. Louise Canady, a retired educator in Perry, Ga., said her 60-person family reunion this year will avoid Georgia Veterans Memorial State Park in Cordele and its privately run restaurant, and opt for a beach location instead. \"I hate it because I liked the atmosphere at the park,\" she said. But \"a young couple simply cannot fork over that kind of money.\"\n\nIn Idaho, Gov. Butch Otter has proposed slashing funding for parks from $16 million to $7 million for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. The state's park and recreation board will decide in May which services to cut. Among the possibilities: delaying maintenance, employing more volunteers instead of seasonal workers and even closing some of the 30 state parks.\n\nThe Nevada Legislature is expected to cut its state park budget by 21%, or $3.2 million, a move that will close two parks later this summer and seven others in the late fall and winter. The cuts won't affect the state's two most popular parks, the Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park and Valley of Fire State Park, which will stay open all year and remain fully staffed.\n\nIn New York, Niagara Falls State Park will trim the hours and days it operates the visitor center and the Cave of the Winds tours. State parks on Long Island will cut programs, including a children's summer theater and a Shakespeare production. The state is trying to find businesses or other local sponsors that might pick up the tab.\n\nJones Beach State Park in Wantagh, Long Island, will open just one of its two swimming pools and bar visitors from 1.5 miles of beachfront -- more than one-sixth of its shoreline. Water activities took a bigger hit because lifeguard and maintenance costs are higher than other kinds of recreation, said Eileen Larrabee, a spokeswoman for New York state parks.\n\nSome residents worry that such a cut will discourage visitors, further draining the local economy. \"I think it will make the rest of the beach more congested,\" said Moke McGowan, president of the Long Island Conventions and Visitors Bureau. \"The experience won't be as enjoyable.\"\n\nWrite to Suzanne Sataline at suzanne.sataline@wsj.com and Tamara Audi at tammy.audi@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Jones Beach State Park is on Long Island Sound.

Yeltsin unveiled his millennium surprise on New Year's Eve, he used the word ''power'' five times in his brief retirement speech.\n\nWhen Lenin issued his famous call to power on Oct. 24, 1917, he also used the word ''power'' five times. Lenin was getting ready to seize it. Mr. Yeltsin, who will go down in history as the man who toppled the totalitarian system Lenin wrought, said he was relinquishing it.\n\nYet power, and the thirst for it, is the connection between two Russian leaders who only a few years ago symbolized opposite extremes.\n\nAs was clear from the moment he mentioned his anointed successor, Vladimir Putin (''I have no doubt what choice you will make at the end of March 2000'' ), Mr. Yeltsin left office not to protect the fragile democracy that brought about his election in 1992, but to preserve the power that his administration came to revere above all else.\n\nAs political theater, it was a classic Yeltsin move -- unpredictable but shrewd. Mr. Yeltsin no doubt realized that Mr. Putin's surge in popularity, based on public support for a military crackdown in Chechnya, might not last until June, when elections were supposed to take place. By then enough soldiers will have come home in body bags to contradict the promise of a clean, easy victory -- as they did the last time Mr. Yeltsin tried to impose Russian might on the rebel republic.\n\n''Why hold on to power for another six months?'' Mr. Yeltsin said, with a straight face. ''No, this is not me, this is not in my character,''\n\nHolding on to power, against all odds, has been the one steady feature of Mr. Yeltsin's remarkably inconsistent tenure as president. And that too is not all that surprising. Power has been the driving force of Russian politics since the time of the czars, through the Soviet Union and beyond. For all the mistakes and misjudgments that Mr. Yeltsin conceded and regretted, he never lost sight of what matters in Russia. Russians have been so crushed for so long that they have learned to respond only to an iron fist, and Mr. Yeltsin played to that instinct again and again, taking on the role of the autocrat as nimbly as he had turned himself into a democrat when the Soviet Empire began to topple.\n\nOver the past few years, the West has mainly seen Mr. Yeltsin through the prism of news clips, embarrassing shots of him toppling over at official ceremonies, frugging at a rock concert or recovering from heart surgery in a government dacha. Russians have also seen him act out rituals that date to the czars, shaking his finger at quaking local bureaucrats, ordering them to raise wages that Moscow had already cut back.\n\nHe came to public notice in the late 1980's as a populist who rode public buses and hectored party officials, but he seamlessly recast himself as an age-old Kremlin ruler, surrounded by sycophants and bodyguards, allowing corruption to flourish at the highest levels.\n\nDURING the coup of 1991, when Mr. Yeltsin stood on a tank to defy the old Soviet guard into history, he created one of the most electrifying moments in the recent past.\n\nBut when he took over, he ruled by contradiction. He fired scores of advisers, rehired many and fired them again -- and again.\n\nAnatoly Chubais, a former deputy prime minister who is viewed by the West as the last guarantor of free-market rules, was kicked in and out of power. So was Boris Berezovsky, the crafty tycoon who symbolizes the entrenched business interests that want to impose their own rule on the Russian market. Mr. Yeltsin deserves credit for seeking to introduce real economic freedom in a country that never experienced it, but he will also be remembered as the ruler who oversaw the birth of Russia's plutocracy.\n\nHe will get credit for leaving the Kremlin voluntarily, something no one in Russian history had ever done, except Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- at a time when Mr. Yeltsin had the upper hand and had left him no choice.\n\nBut this was not like a broken Lyndon Johnson refusing to run for a second term. Mr. Yeltsin wants to be succeeded by someone whose loyalty will last and will not hound him in retirement with criminal charges, financial restraints or just lese majeste. Mr. Putin remains unproven as a leader. For now, he mainly represents Mr. Yeltsin's desire to keep his grip on Russia's future - and preserve his own.\n\nOr, as Lenin put it in 1917, ''the seizure of power is the business of the uprising; its political purpose will become clear after the seizure.''\n\nPhoto: Boris Yeltsin in better times, in 1993.

Bernard!\u201d from the adjacent room.\n\nAnd when Mr. Sanders celebrated winning the New Hampshire primary for the Democratic presidential nomination this month, Levi, now 46, applauded on stage, right behind him.\n\nUnlike most candidates, Mr. Sanders only passingly refers to the members of his family in speeches, and they are largely absent from his ads or campaign imagery. They are, he has made clear, irrelevant to his message about waging a revolution against America\u2019s \u201crigged economy.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders, in fact, has four children and seven grandchildren he calls his own. Three of those children are from the previous marriage of his wife, Jane. But in the beginning, there was Levi, his only biological child.\n\nAnd throughout Mr. Sanders\u2019s long political career, Levi has been a constant witness to a life in which socialist, anti-establishment politics and devoted parenting as a part-time father were all one and the same.\n\n\u201cHe is someone who gives hope that things can change,\u201d said Levi Sanders, who has his father\u2019s bounding walk and straight-arm lean into the lectern, before introducing the candidate in Wolfeboro, N.H., in January. He added, \u201cI could go on and on.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 primaries and caucuses have begun. See results and upcoming primary dates.\n\nSenator Sanders, his campaign, and his wife and children declined to comment for this article, as did his first wife, Deborah Shiling. So did the former girlfriend whom, until July, Mr. Sanders did not publicly acknowledge as Levi\u2019s biological mother, having never corrected reporters who had previously described Levi as a product of his first marriage.\n\nMr. Sanders married Ms. Shiling in 1964, and the lasting memory of that wedding to some who attended was a bee that flew menacingly around the rabbi\u2019s mouth. In less than two years, the marriage fell apart.\n\nThe couple had no children, but after the breakup, Mr. Sanders became intensely interested in child psychology. He worked at mental hospitals and Head Start programs. His brother, Larry Sanders, recalled him starting a sort of personal Fresh Air Fund, in which Bernie Sanders, a Brooklyn native, took children from East Harlem up to Vermont for camping trips.\n\nIn March 1969, four days after Mr. Sanders bought an A-frame farmhouse in Stannard, a tiny town with no paved roads in Vermont\u2019s Northeast Kingdom, his girlfriend, Susan Campbell Mott, delivered Levi Noah Sanders.\n\nIt was a short-lived Vermont idyll. Soon after, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Mott broke up, and she moved to Burlington. Mr. Sanders followed to be close to Levi, according to his brother, who, like several others, said the parents remained amicable partners, sharing custody.\n\nFriends recalled Ms. Mott\u2019s picking up Levi at 8 a.m. at his father\u2019s dark, messy house, where there was little in the fridge. (\u201cI eat to live,\u201d Mr. Sanders liked to say.) But Levi, friends said, never wanted for food or affection.\n\nLevi Sanders\u2019s anti-establishment upbringing influenced him early on. \u201cI never have called him Dad,\u201d he told People magazine in January. \u201cEven when I was 6 years old, I thought it was childish. He was a friend, not an authoritarian.\u201d\n\nThat first-name basis reflected Mr. Sanders\u2019s views on child development. The month Levi was born, The Vermont Freeman published a letter by Mr. Sanders lamenting the state of schooling and asserting that \u201cmany young parents are beginning to think, come what may, that it is better for their children not to go to school at all than to attend a normal type establishment.\u201d In other writings, he championed at-home childbirth and lamented infants being \u201cbottle fed on assembly line schedules by assembly line doctors.\u201d\n\nThose ideas on home schooling and home birth later became more popular. Some of his other ideas have yet to catch on.\n\nIn December 1969, he published in The Freeman \u201cCancer, Disease and Society,\u201d an article based on the work of the Austrian psychologist Wilhelm Reich, exploring whether sexual repression and the stifling of children contributed to cancer.\n\nThe \u201cmanner in which you bring up your daughter with regard to sexual attitudes may very well determine whether or not she will develop breast cancer, among other things,\u201d he wrote. He added that it was important for boys to rebel in school because if they bottled up their emotions, \u201c30 years later, a doctor tells him that he has cancer.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders also thought children should be allowed to vote once they reached puberty. A political ally, Peter Diamondstone, who thought the voting age should be abolished altogether, recalled asking Mr. Sanders: \u201cSo every time you want to have a kid vote they have to go get a physical?\u201d\n\nBut when it came to his own son, Mr. Sanders was more traditional.\n\nMr. Sanders gave clear boundaries to Levi, with whom he could occasionally be \u201coverbearing,\u201d according to Nancy Barnett, a friend. She recalled one day when Mr. Sanders, a former cross-country star, ran laps with Levi around the high school track until the 9-year-old stopped with exhaustion.\n\n\u201cBernie was adamant,\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2018You started your race \u2014 now you\u2019ve got to finish your race.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders, as his campaigning has shown, is nothing if not perseverant.\n\nHis outsider campaigns for governor and senator, conducted much of the time with Levi in tow, went nowhere. With Ms. Barnett, he scraped together a living selling very low-budget films, sometimes using Levi\u2019s toy robot for sound effects, about historical figures like Ethan Allen and Eugene V. Debs. He wrote freelance articles, put down flooring and, for a time, collected unemployment. After his rent skyrocketed, he crashed in 1979 at the home of a good friend, Richard Sugarman, who had once been former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman\u2019s suite mate at Yale.\n\nThey talked often about the crummy state of the world and when Levi visited, which was often, \u201cBernard always tried to include him in the conversation,\u201d Mr. Sugarman said.\n\nHe added that Mr. Sanders also took Levi to shoot hoops and get books from the library. \u201cHe wanted him to be a well-educated and happy person,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Mr. Sanders finally found a steady paycheck and national exposure, as the successful socialist mayor of Burlington, Levi attended public schools and followed in his father\u2019s footsteps as a basketball player and member of the track team.\n\n\u201cA kind person,\u201d said Jennifer Swiatek, who was in German Club with Levi.\n\nAnd a loyal one. In 1987, Levi returned from college in Springfield, Mass., to appear in the season finale of his father\u2019s cable access show, \u201cBernie Speaks.\u201d Looking intermittently bored, freezing and exhausted in a trench coat, Levi held the microphone for his father in front of City Hall, a hospital, the local paper, the waterfront and a shelter.\n\nIn 1987, Levi Sanders was a guest on his father's television program, which he produced as mayor of Burlington, Vt.\n\nAs mayor, Mr. Sanders kept advocating his views about income inequality and, at a 1988 forum, again denounced the \u201cpsychosomatic aspects of cancer.\u201d That year, he married Jane, and Levi transferred to the University of Oregon. After graduation, he inherited his father\u2019s ideology, but also his economic travails.\n\nIn 1999, he complained that high rents forced him out of Burlington, as his $20,000-a-year job running the grocery distribution department at a food bank did not pay the bills. A blossoming animal rights activist, he also complained about the state\u2019s decision to kill a black bear that had lost its fear of humans.\n\n\u201cIt was just a friendly bear,\u201d he told The Burlington Free Press at the time.\n\nHe wrote letters urging voters to continue his father\u2019s legacy by voting for progressive candidates and in 2001 was featured in the PBS documentary \u201cPeople Like Us: Social Class in America,\u201d taking the side of the poor in a fight over whether a new Burlington grocery store should be a supermarket or an upscale co-op. He noted with reluctance how poor people looked with suspicion at healthier, natural foods favored by the wealthy. \u201cWhite bread is basically a class issue,\u201d he said, holding a loaf of sourdough.\n\nLevi Sanders was an assistant manager at the Burlington Emergency Food Shelf when he was interviewed for the 2001 documentary \u201cPeople Like Us: Social Class in America.\u201d\n\nAt age 40, Levi Sanders ran for a seat on the Claremont, N.H., City Council, finishing seventh in a field of nine.\n\nSince then, he has accompanied his father to White House Hanukkah parties and raised his three children, adopted from China, with his wife, Raine Riggs, a neuropsychologist whose studies have included the psychiatric syndromes connected to cancer diagnoses. Levi himself works as an advocate for people seeking Social Security benefits.\n\nThe couple still lives in New Hampshire, where before the primary there, Levi was able to help his father achieve the crowning political achievement, so far, of his life\u2019s work.\n\nWith his presidential bid in need of some humanizing last fall, Mr. Sanders went trick-or-treating with Levi\u2019s children. Television cameras followed. But so, as always, did Levi, a few paces behind his father.",

    "text": "Well, everyone must at least feel better now, having chanted and declared for days that we're all Charlie.\n\nIt was, or it seemed, a cry for freedom of speech, ringing outward from one of the world's first secular democracies.\n\nIn reality, though, with all due respect to the sentiment behind it, Sunday's great march through the centre of Paris, and others like it around the world, must qualify as one of the greatest collective acts of slacktivism so far this century.\n\nAnd the consequences of all this outrage may be far from what the protesters intended.\n\nThink about it: just whom were these marchers addressing? The executioners who showed up at Charlie Hebdo last week?\n\nIf those characters were still alive, they would probably answer no, you're not Charlie, because we killed Charlie.\n\nPerhaps the slogan was directed at the bearded ISIS fighters who've been slaughtering and raping and oppressing their way through modern-day Mesopotamia and the Levant.\n\nIf so, the message was probably received with some bemusement. Perhaps even a bit of triumphalism. Score another one for their version of Islam.\n\nOr were the I-Am-Charlie crowds addressing their own governments?\n\nThe leaders of several governments were in fact marching right up front with them in Paris over the weekend, which was a wonderful photo op, but really a bit rich given some of the alliances and the practices that some of those nations are involved in.\n\nCertain close strategic partners of the U.S. and Canada are actively and violently anti-free-speech.\n\nEgypt, a big recipient of U.S. aid, imprisons and tortures people just for belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood, which was democratically elected to govern and then overthrown.\n\nThere were some odd bedfellows in the gathering of world leaders who participated in Sunday's march in Paris. (Philippe Wojazer/Reuters)\n\nOn Friday, two days after the Charlie Hebdo killings, Saudi Arabia administered the first 50 of a thousand lashes to Raif Badawi, a blogger convicted of insulting Islam.\n\nHe is also serving a 10-year prison sentence. Which means, effectively, that the Saudis intend to lash Badawi grievously, perhaps even to death, for speech far less corrosive than Charlie Hebdo's deliberately insulting cartoons.\n\nHow does that make Saudi Arabia substantively different from the Charlie Hebdo attackers? Is it merely a matter of scale and method?\n\nWhere Saudi is concerned, though, the West has chosen its criticism carefully. The State Department (not the president) called the Badawi sentence \"inhumane.\"\n\nCanada's \"ambassador for religious freedom\" (not the prime minister) echoed that, calling it \"unbecoming of a society that seeks to advance itself within the family of nations.\"\n\nThe Saudis, unsurprisingly, seem undeterred.\n\nThe fact is, even Western governments are never terribly enthusiastic about free speech, or at least speech they find inconvenient.\n\nTwo years ago, President Barack Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney, criticized Charlie Hebdo for publishing the cartoons that eventually drew the killers to its offices.\n\n\"We know that these images will be deeply offensive to many and have the potential to be inflammatory,\" Carney declared in late 2012.\n\nNote this is the same administration that publicly castigated Sony Pictures for caving to pressure recently and NOT releasing a film that was deeply offensive to North Korea.\n\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper, in his official statement of outrage at the Charlie Hebdo attack, made no reference to free speech at all, which shouldn't surprise anyone. Canada, unlike the U.S., offers no guarantee of absolute free speech in its constitution.\n\nAnd Canadians are certainly not Charlie. My guess is that an English-language version of Charlie Hebdo wouldn't last even a few days in Canada before concerned Muslim or Christian or Jewish citizens would be demanding charges be laid under Canada's hate-speech laws, or dragging the magazine before one of our provincial human rights commissions that specialize in rooting out offensive expression.\n\nCanada even has an anti-blasphemy law on the books. It was last used in an attempted private prosecution against the distributors of the Monty Python movie Life of Brian in 1980.\n\nWestern governments are, however, quite interested in enforcement and security, and that, not more speech, is the order of the day once again.\n\nWith unintended irony, and a very short memory, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls declared over the weekend that France is now locked in a \"war on terror.\"\n\nFrench soldiers patrol near a department store in Paris as part of the highest security clampdown in decades. (Eric Gaillard/Reuters)\n\nThat's exactly the term George W. Bush used after 9/11. It presaged an unprecedented expansion of the surveillance state and the powers of America's security apparatus.\n\nCivil liberties were tossed aside. Other countries' laws, even those of U.S. allies, became irrelevant.\n\nAnd the frightened American population cheered.\n\nThe French, among others, mocked the slogan relentlessly, especially once it became apparent that the U.S. invasion of Iraq, carried out as part of this war on terror, was based on a false pretext.\n\nEventually, Bush's own Pentagon quietly dropped the slogan. And when the Democrats took the White House, they repudiated it.\n\nBut it's clearly back on. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder agreed with the French prime minister. America, he said, is at war, too.\n\nNext month, Washington is convening an international summit to discuss new measures.\n\nCanada is preparing new legislation to expand the powers of its security agencies.\n\nThe French, and the Americans, and no doubt the Canadians, are considering how better to monitor and obliterate incitement on the internet.\n\nOr, more precisely, what security officials consider incitement. It's a term that can be interpreted rather broadly, and no doubt will be.\n\nClearly, the ultimate answer to the Charlie Hebdo massacre will not be freer speech. It will be a mostly secret intensification of police power, with attendant shrinkage of individual freedoms.\n\nAnd we will all be told not to worry: If you aren't doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about.\n\nAt least one French demonstrator seemed to recognize some of this over the weekend. The sign he hoisted read: \"Je marche, mais je suis conscient de la confusion et de l'hypocrisie de la situation.\"\n\nI march, but I am aware of the confusion and hypocrisy of the situation.",

    "text": "By Sean Leahy, USA TODAY\n\nSaturday's NFL draft is a gamble for Michigan State wide receiver Devin Thomas.\n\nThe odds in his favor? Try the team-record 79 catches (with 1,260 receiving yards, eight touchdowns and 1,135 kick return yards) the junior had last year and the impressive workout season (he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds at the scouting combine in February) during which he has emerged as one of the most coveted receiving prospects.\n\nThe odds against him? The possibility that no team will pick a receiver until later in the first round \u2026 and the potential that another season with the Spartans could have made him one of the elite players for the 2009 draft.\n\nIt's a scenario that Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio laid out for Thomas about the player turning pro a year early. With just one season of production on his resume, Thomas, a junior college transfer who caught just six passes in 2006 while adjusting to Division I-A, is a question mark to NFL talent evaluators.\n\n\"If he had been this consistent over his career, then you'd been talking about a top-five pick,\" said Rob Rang, an analyst for NFLDraftScout.com. \"The only thing holding him back at this point is the fact that he only did it for one year.\"\n\nA backup when spring camp opened last year, Thomas earned a starting job by season opener and quickly emerged as the focal point of the Michigan State offense. A threat to score from anywhere on the field, Thomas' size (6-2, 215) helped make him what Michigan State quarterback Brian Hoyer called a \"hard load to bring down.\"\n\nRecalling a Penn State defender who got burned by Thomas for a score last season, Hoyer said, \"Devin gave him a nudge, the guy fell off and Devin ran for a touchdown. It was like a little kid trying to guard a man out there.\"\n\nYet in the NFL, Thomas will find defensive backs who are likely to be stronger and faster than those he darted past in the Big Ten. And he'll have to overcome the stigma that it's hard for underclassman wide receivers to thrive in the rookie year.\n\n\"There's a long history of junior receivers who have a hard time\" said Baltimore Ravens director of college scouting Eric DeCosta.\n\nFor some young receivers, trouble can start early in camp when defenders jam them at the line of scrimmage, a competition they were accustomed to winning easily. Struggles in that man-on-man strength move affect their confidence and slow their development, said NFL Network analyst Charles Davis.\n\nGet off the line, and the window of opportunity is markedly smaller than what the receivers were used to as underclassmen.\n\n\"In college you can create more separation either by being physical or being faster,\" Davis said. \"There's not always someone right on the spot to make the tackle. But in the NFL, it's a surprise when someone isn't on the spot to make the tackle.\"\n\nThomas is undeterred by speculation that he might have benefited from another year at Michigan State. \"I feel like I'm pretty much ready right now,\" he said. \"I need to get acclimated with NFL style and speed, but I have the mentality and ability.\n\n\"I don't see me fading away from doing what I normally do. My track record is as a playmaker.\"\n\nHis small body of work makes scouring that track record of the former Coffeyville (Kan.) Community College player even more important.\n\n\"The thing that would concern you the most would be character,\" said NFL Network and CBS Sports analyst Charley Casserly, the former general manager of the Washington Redskins and the Houston Texans.\n\n\"If you're satisfied that (Thomas' limited resume) was not due to his lack of effort, intelligence, toughness or skill, then you move on.\"\n\nTEAMS IN NEED: Who's targeting receivers\n\n\u2022 Baltimore Ravens: Derrick Mason was fourth in the NFL with 103 receptions last season, but the 34-year-old is approaching his 12th season. Behind him is fourth-year player Mark Clayton, who has yet to live up to his first-round billing. The Ravens have kicked the tires on the draft's top receiving prospects in workouts, though their first pick at No. 8 may be too early to choose one.\n\n\u2022 Buffalo Bills: Last season's 31st-ranked receiving unit needs a second option to support the game-breaking speed of Lee Evans, who fell from career highs of 82 catches and 1,292 yards in 2006 to 55 and 849 last season. They've yet to add receivers to a corps that counted Josh Reed and Roscoe Parrish as its second- and third-leading pass-catchers. But with the 11th pick, Buffalo might draft too early to invest in any of this year's wideout class.\n\n\u2022 Chicago Bears: They responded to the loss of No. 1 receiver Bernard Berrian to division rival Minnesota in free agency by signing veterans Brandon Lloyd and Marty Booker. Neither will take much heat off whoever ends up at quarterback. Their leading wide receiver from last season still on their roster? Devin Hester, who had 20 catches, and whose dynamic talents have not yet translated to offense. Chicago must find one in the draft or risk another long season for Rex Grossman, et al.\n\n\u2022 Miami Dolphins: The new Bill Parcells regime cut last season's leading receiver, Marty Booker. Last April the Dolphins drafted a wideout, Ted Ginn Jr., with the ninth overall pick, but whether he can become the No. 1 option is still unknown. They'll surely need more help for whoever lines up under center this season. A receiver won't be an option with the first overall pick, but Miami has two second-round picks where they might target the position.\n\n\u2022 Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Jeff Garcia would surely enjoy an infusion of youth into a receiving unit that counted 32-year-old Ike Hilliard and 36-year-old Joey Galloway as its most productive members last year. Antonio Bryant came in as a free agent, but a replacement for Galloway's production (three consecutive seasons with more than 1,000 yards receiving) must be a priority. DeSean Jackson might be a target with the 20th pick.\n\n\u2022 Tennessee Titans: They re-signed leading receiver Justin Gage to a long-term deal, but Vince Young needs a go-to wideout. The re-acquisition of Justin McCareins and further development of Roydell Williams could help, but a game-breaking presence is needed for a team that ranked 27th and 30th in passing offense the past two seasons and threw for just nine touchdowns in 2007.\n\nCREAM OF THE CROP: Best of the rest at receiver\n\n\u2014 Early Doucet, LSU, 6-0, 209\n\n\u2022 Scouting report: With secure hands and a knack for breaking tackles, skills might translate into a slot receiver. An effective blocker with strong instincts for when to dial back and help at the line of scrimmage. Doesn't have impressive speed (a 4.54 40 at the combine and 4.59 at his pro day). Groin injury that limited his effectiveness last season.\n\n\u2022 Insider's take: \"He just lacks the speed you're looking for from a No. 1 receiver.\" \u2014Rob Rang, senior analyst, NFLDraftScout.com\n\n\u2014 James Hardy, Indiana, 6-6, 217\n\n\u2022 Scouting report: Speed and size allow him to out jump defenders, but might need to add bulk to the lanky frame. Set school records with 79 catches, 1,125 yards and 16 touchdowns last season. A potential black mark: arrested in May 2006 on domestic battery charges.\n\n\u2022 Insider's take: \"He's a big, physical receiver who go up and get the ball and has a knack for making plays.\" \u2014Billy Lynch, Indiana University receivers coach\n\n\u2014 DeSean Jackson, Cal, 5-10, 169\n\n\u2022 Scouting report: Despite his small frame, speed (he ran a 4.35 40-yard dash) makes him dangerous downfield and agility helps him elude open-field tackles. Size limits his ability as a blocker and raises durability issues, especially after being dogged by injuries in 2007. Also a threat as a punt returner.\n\n\u2022 Insider's take: \"Football is a game of speed and he's a gamebreaker. He can change the momentum of the game.\" \u2014Jeff Tedford, Cal head coach\n\n\u2014 Malcolm Kelly, Oklahoma, 6-4, 224\n\n\u2022 Scouting report: Size, quickness and good hands make him seem like a prototype front-line receiver. But stock has fallen dramatically since February, and it was not helped by critical comments about the Oklahoma training staff at pro day because of his unhappiness with field conditions.\n\n\u2022 Insider's take: \"Potentially a spectacular possession receiver ... he needs to work on his route running because he won't get by on athleticism alone at this level.\" \u2014Rang\n\n\u2014 Limas Sweed, Texas, 6-4, 215\n\n\u2022 Scouting report: Can stretch the field. But recovering from a wrist injury that limited him to six games last season. Started 39 consecutive games before injury. Caught 65 passes with 15 touchdowns over his final 18 games.\n\n\u2022 Insider's take: \"He went against five NFL (drafted) guys we had on our team. He had great success against those guys in practice.\" \u2014Bobby Kennedy, Texas receivers coach\n\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

    "text": "A recent CareerBuilder survey suggests that 21% of workers plan to change jobs this year -\u2013 a 17% jump from last year, and the highest percentage since the recession.\n\nFor employers, this turnover rate can be a frightening thought, especially when you consider the potential impact that the loss of an employee can have on productivity and morale. In this competitive environment, many employers are likely wondering how to keep their brightest stars and how to bring promising fresh blood neatly into the fold.\n\nNot long ago, Big Spaceship held a hack day, in which members of our crew could self-organize to produce anything that made our agency a better place. There were a number of results \u2014 from solutions for a healthy workplace to tools to appreciate daily moments of humor and joy. Big Spaceship has been evolving its culture for 14 years, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that a printed book -\u2013 a rarity in the digital age -\u2013 would illuminate the ins and outs of our company values and what they mean to employees new and old.\n\nTurns out, this simple reminder of our values has been a key ingredient in keeping our already tight-knit crew as cohesive as ever. It\u2019s helped the youngest and newest staff members feel engaged and confident, and encouraged the most senior employees to remain open-minded. Culture is organic; it changes and it can\u2019t be dictated by one person.\n\nAs your company begins to look inward to attract and retain employees, here are five tips that any business can use to create its own culture manual.\n\nA successful manual must be a manifestation of the culture that already exists at your company. Its origins should be completely organic \u2013- a far cry from many corporate environments, in which a single person or committee is responsible for dictating the culture. Remember: Your culture may be encouraged from the top-down, but it will only take hold from the bottom-up.\n\nOne of the ways that smart business leaders can spur this phenomenon is by actively putting hiring power into their employees\u2019 hands and allowing them input on who joins their environment. Google, renowned for its organic culture, is a great example of this; the company institutes committees when taking on new hires, naturally helping everyone feel involved and valued.\n\nPeople appreciate the honest truth, because it means you respect their intelligence. A lot of things that make a company great require sacrifices, and your manual should tell both sides of the story.\n\nEncourage your employees to ask for help when they need it; feeling supported is absolutely essential to maintaining worker happiness. But don\u2019t let them get too comfortable. Force them to take initiative and, instead of complaining, take it upon themselves to make changes when and how they see fit. Happiness and productivity both stem as equally from independence and confidence as they do from a sense of support.\n\nFreedom and time are golden. In the modern workplace, these are two attributes that can be extremely hard to come by \u2014 especially when it seems as if every half-hour a new meeting alert pops up. Technology is turning many employees' ways of life into a vicious cycle, transforming them into slaves to their calendars.\n\nDon\u2019t let your employees become cogs in the wheel. Give them permission to take a step back from the grind and make culture a priority, not an add-on. Sometimes the best brief will say, \"Here\u2019s the general space we\u2019re playing in. The rest is up to you.\"\n\nStudies have proven that purpose-driven brands have greater success than those that are only concerned with maximizing shareholder value. But aligning your company with certain beliefs and behaviors also means that not everyone will be a perfect fit within the company's culture. To be straightforward at Big Spaceship, we list our values on our careers page, because we know it will help attract the right kind of people \u2014 and let others know they might be better off elsewhere.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is a brand that\u2019s been lauded for being particularly purpose-driven in recent years. They\u2019ve built up a reputation for being hard-working, respectful and, perhaps most importantly, laid back and friendly. They stay away from candidates who don\u2019t fit the bill, and these efforts have paid off: The company has only a 2% turnover rate.\n\nIt\u2019s important that every workplace articulate its unique features and create themes, both internally and externally, that can be narrowed down and shared with all employees. Defining distinct pillars will help your employees feel grounded in their day-to-day, and will keep the sometimes numerous and potentially overwhelming aspects of your culture in perspective.\n\nZappos is successful at this type of transparency. Its list of ten core values, while a bit lengthy, manages to convey a simple and flexible framework within which its employees can work and play. It\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s worked for us, as well. Our manual has three chapters: the first is about embracing humanity in the workplace, the second is about collaboration and the third is \"We Change.\"\n\nEmployers, how do you inspire empowerment in the workplace? Share in the comments.\n\nThe Mashable Job Board connects job seekers across the U.S. with unique career opportunities in the digital space. While we publish a wide range of job listings, we have selected a few job opportunities from the past several weeks to help get you started. Happy hunting!",

They used to hold them out of town, often in luxurious surroundings \u2014 and call them retreats \u2014 but that was before the days of lean budgets, public curmudgeonliness about excess spending and, oh, legal rulings that required them to meet within their jurisdictions.\n\nAnyway, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency held its annual workshop meeting, retreating from usual hallowed meeting place, Room 400 at City Hall, to a very cold room at the luxuriously named Southeast Community Facility in the Bayview.\n\nBig thoughts were indeed discussed on topics ranging from the MTA\u2019s strategic plan to the San Francisco County Transportation Authority\u2019s Transportation Plan to bicycle and pedestrian strategies to the transit effectiveness project and the facilities and real estate vision.\n\nBut among those big thoughts were some little tidbits of interest. Here are a handful:\n\n\u2013 The MTA may be a big agency overseeing parking, taxis, traffic and transit but its director, Ed Reiskin, described Muni as its \u201cheart and soul.\u201d\n\n\u2013 The heart and soul plans to replace all 800 of its \u201crubber-tired vehicles\u201d \u2014 most of us call them buses \u2014 over the next seven years.\n\n\u2013 Some of those buses were around the last time the 49ers played in the Super Bowl \u2014 in 1994 \u2014 when they hauled fans to the victory parade, said John Haley, the transit director.\n\n\u2013 New parking meters are coming! About 29,000 of them, enough to replace the old meters, with about 6,000 more for SF Park, the Port and new locations to be named later. They\u2019ll take credit cards and be easier to read.\n\n\u2013 Car sharing operators could get use of some on-street parking places \u2014 including in residential neighborhoods \u2014 as the MTA tries to encourage more people to share cars.\n\n\u2013 Muni is over capacity \u2014 no surprise to anyone who\u2019s ever tried to ride the N-Judah \u2014 and the agency is actually looking at how to encourage people who could easily walk or bike to their destinations to do that instead, clearing room on the buses and trains.\n\n\u2013 Muni\u2019s transit effectiveness project envisions a 10 percent increase in service to meet and keep up with demand as the city grows.\n\n\u2013 As part of the transit program, Muni will test a transit-only lane on Church Street. It will be painted red (\u201cA red carpet ride\u201d) to go with the green-painted bike lanes. But the project has been slowed because temperatures have to be above 55 degrees for an extended period for the paint to stick to the pavement.\n\n\u2013 The MTA is, as always, thinking about how to raise more money. This time they\u2019re thinking of a general obligation bond measure that would go before voters. Given Mayor Ed Lee\u2019s State of the City commitment to Muni, expect to hear more about this idea.",

    "text": "Welcome to my mea culpa.\n\nI have spent so much time looking for the next Derek Jeter that, to some degree, I have missed Derek Jeter. Or at least the reasons that make him so unique.\n\nAt times in the last decade, I have written columns that anticipated Jose Reyes, Elvis Andrus and Xander Bogaerts doing to Jeter what Jeter did to Cal Ripken Jr. in the mid-1990s \u2014 taking the baton as the Next Great Shortstop.\n\nBut Reyes, Andrus and Bogaerts failed to translate promise to sustained excellence \u2014 at least to this point. Their inability to do so accentuates Jeter\u2019s greatness. He showed up special and never really deviated until late in his career. There were not multiple detours for injury or bad seasons. He was a metronome of brilliance, day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month and \u2014 most important \u2014 year to year.\n\nA cottage industry rose over the last two decades to disassemble Jeter, to say the superlatives were exaggerated. That folks were so enamored with him, they pumped his status undeservedly.\n\nAlex Rodriguez, with that bizarre combination of both an overinflated and fragile ego, forever wrecked his relationship with Jeter by taking to Esquire in April 2001 to disparage Jeter as a player his team did not fear when it played the Yankees.\n\nOne advanced defensive system after another has calculated Jeter among the worst defensive shortstops ever.\n\nAnd, yes, I was among those who, at times, saw the holes rather than the whole.\n\nIn the 2006-08 time period, I was positive Reyes \u2014 younger, more athletic, a switch-hitter \u2014 was going to become the predominant shortstop in at least New York. But, mostly due to an inability to stay healthy, that never occurred. Reyes looks as if he will endure a career of \u201cwhat ifs?\u201d\n\nIn the 2010 ALCS, Rangers vs. Yankees seemed best symbolized by Andrus vs. Jeter \u2014 young, spry and the future vs. old, creaky and the past. I referred to it as New Elvis vs. Old Elvis. However, the genius in this sport is not to do it, but to do it over and over and over again. It is to master the 162 games, an unforgiving grind. And master it once more and once more with every new calendar.\n\nElvis Andrus and Derek JeterPhoto: UPI\n\nAndrus got a long-term contract, eight years, $120 million. The Rangers saw in him what I did. Yet, Andrus has been pretty much in full retreat ever since. As opposed to Jeter, who signed a 10-year, $189 million contract before the 2001 season and just kept on having Jeter seasons, Andrus has stagnated offensively with a season at 25 in 2014 not looking all that different from Jeter\u2019s fade at 40. Texas would love to find a way to trade what remains of that pact. Good luck with that.\n\nLate last season, I tagged Bogaerts as Jeter 2.0. Once again it felt representative of the teams \u2014 the Red Sox rising and the Yankees plummeting. Jeter missed basically all of 2013 with ankle injuries. Bogaerts, who was still four months away from being born when the Yankees drafted Jeter in 1992, delivered precocious at-bats as part of the formula that led Boston to a championship.\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to Cooperstown for Bogaerts. All those can-a-big-guy-play-shortstop worries that pestered Jeter ensnared Bogaerts. Worse, the sure-thing offense wasn\u2019t a sure thing. In one year he had navigated from cornerstone to question mark. Who is he? Where does he play?\n\nXander Bogaerts, at least thus far, has not been the next Derek Jeter.Photo: AP\n\nAbout Bogaerts, Red Sox bench coach Torey Lovullo told The Boston Globe in August: \u201cThis is a hard game \u2014 a really, really hard game. If we all thought we could just snap our fingers and have Derek Jeter on our hands, we were sorely mistaken.\u201d\n\nJeter\u2019s consistency \u2014 as a person and player \u2014 differentiated him. Pretty much every year you could find better players \u2014 heck, you could find better shortstops. But those names came and went. Jeter was like Thanksgiving, there every year.\n\nJeter has as many seminal moments as any player \u2014 The Flip, Mr. October, diving into the crowd against the Red Sox, etc. \u2014 but that was not his definition. Endy Chavez has a highlight, so does Phil Humber. There are many one-hit wonder bands, or two or three. But there are few Rolling Stones, U2s. Few that stand the test of time.\n\nTo fully get Jeter, you had to watch him off the field and on with consistency. Those who played with him, coached him, managed him and played regularly against him deliver the strongest testimonials \u2014 appreciations that go way beyond stats or even those highlight moments.\n\nIt is a hard game, particularly because of the relentless nature, the constant adjustments by opponents to thwart strengths, the microscopic examination by fans and media. It eats its young, chews up its veterans. Just go ask Reyes, Andrus and Bogaerts. It takes a unique combination of skill, fortitude, mental acuity and tenacity to withstand the withering realities, to be the same on Tuesday as you were on Wednesday, the same in April as September, the same in 1996 as 2006. The granular nature of statistics now reveals much and Jeter will grade out statistically \u2014 old or new \u2014 as one of the greatest shortstops in major league history.\n\nBut he is an outlier to stats, as well. His value transcended his numbers. His confident, win-oriented, respectful, prepared persona elevated his teammates and gave comfort to his managers. He helped make the claustrophobic, can\u2019t-escape-it biosphere that is eight-to-nine months together in a clubhouse a better working environment. Injuries, under-performance, pettiness, etc., consume front offices, which are pretty much in 24-7 fireman mode.

He eased the life of a front office, made it simpler to assemble and run a team.\n\nThis all adds up to something related to winning that we have yet to quantify, but that Jeter embodied. Steadiness, solidity, constancy.\n\nFrom left, clockwise: Alex Gonzalez, Edgar Renteria, Rey Ordonez, Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez, in 1997.Photo: Sports Illustrated\n\nThink of that famous 1997 Sports Illustrated photo of five shirtless young shortstops \u2014 Jeter, A-Rod, Alex Gonzalez, Rey Ordonez and Edgar Renteria.

Or whichever Steinbrenner, George, Hank or Hal, was running the team.\n\nIf you saw Jeter on any one day, you saw a heck of a player. But it was all of those undeviating days that made the mosaic, that made the masterpiece. He could sprint when necessary, but the marathon was his forte. The tortoise steadily winning the race.\n\nIf you kept waiting for the next Derek Jeter \u2014 and, unfortunately, at times, I did \u2014 you kind of missed the point of his career, you read the book without getting the meaning.\n\nThe next Derek Jeter just kept on being Derek Jeter.",

    "text": "(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n\nLONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - On the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark nickel for three-month delivery is currently trading around $10,000 per tonne.\n\nWhich, as with all the other industrial metals traded on the LME, is the lowest it has been since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009.\n\nBut whereas the likes of copper and aluminium are still comfortably above the troughs recorded during the worst of the manufacturing meltdown that followed the financial meltdown, nickel is actually there.\n\nNickel hit a low of $9,100 during its \"flash crash\" of Aug. 12, within spitting distance of the low of $8,850 recorded in October 2009, the month after the fateful \"Lehman Moment\".\n\nIt's an extraordinary outcome for a metal which, unlike most of the rest of the LME complex, is experiencing both a structural tightening of supply and a growing number of price-related supply hits.\n\nSo is nickel the victim of irrational fear and panic, a collateral casualty of the financial volatility that has rippled out from collapsing Chinese stock markets?\n\nOr are there good reasons for it treading the same ground as during the last period of global market disorder?\n\nGraphic on long-term nickel price and stocks:\n\nOne key difference between now and then is the level of stocks, or at least visible stocks, hanging over the market.\n\nWhen nickel recorded that historic low back in October 2008 LME nickel stocks stood at 57,000 tonnes.\n\nBy January 2010, following one of the most severe manufacturing collapses in living memory, they had risen to 166,000 tonnes.\n\nCompare and contrast with the recent June peak of 465,564 tonnes of exchange-registered inventory. It should almost go without saying that this was an all-time high.\n\nUnsurprisingly, such a huge overhang of metal was already pressuring prices ever lower even before the Shanghai stock market went into free fall.\n\nWhere did all the stocks come from?\n\nWell, a lot of them came from China, flushed out of the shadow financing trade by the Qingdao port scandal and the resulting mass movement of metal to safe-haven storage.\n\nBetween June 2014, when the allegations of multiple pledging of metal in Qingdao first started making the headlines, and March this year China exported 100,000 tonnes of refined nickel. That was more than was notched up over the previous two years and sufficient to turn the country into a net exporter for the first time since at least 2002.\n\nBut rising inventory also reflected two other drivers more rooted in the nickel market's fundamentals.\n\nThe first was surging production. Refined nickel output grew at an average pace of close to 11 percent per year in the 2011-2013 period, according to the International Nickel Study Group (INSG).\n\nAnd that's not including China's vast nickel pig iron (NPI) sector, which by definition doesn't produce refined metal but rather an intermediate product that can be fed directly into stainless steel furnaces.\n\nIt was with hindsight a classic case of commodity bad timing, a new generation of plants planned during the boom years of 2006-2007 finally making it into production, often after protracted overruns.\n\nSuch a supply surge was always going to be a test of whether demand could absorb all this extra metal.\n\nGraphic on Chinese stainless steel production:\n\nCue the second bit of commodity market bad timing.\n\nWhile the broader markets fret about slowing industrial activity in China, nickel arguably has experienced its own Chinese \"hard landing\".\n\nChina's output of stainless steel, the largest first-stage usage sector for nickel, fell by 1.4 percent in the first quarter of this year.\n\nWhich doesn't sound like a big deal at all, until you consider that prior to this year Chinese stainless steel production had been rising at a double-digit pace, 14 percent in 2014 and 18 percent in 2013.\n\nThis is only partly related to the broader Chinese slowdown story. An extra headwind for China's stainless producers has come from trade sanctions, particularly those implemented by the European Union.\n\nChinese stainless producers, like their carbon steel and aluminium counterparts, had been exporting their way out of domestic market weakness.\n\nHowever, while carbon steel producers can switch alloying mixes and aluminium producers shift product mixes to navigate a growing list of trade sanctions, stainless mills seem to have hit a hard wall.\n\nExports of carbon steel have carried on booming despite a growing number of trade sanctions. Those of stainless steel have fallen by 21 percent so far this year, according to analysts at Jefferies.\n\n\"Due to the smaller size and more niche product qualities of stainless steel, we believe proof is mounting that protectionist policy can have a more substantive impact on stainless than carbon steel markets,\" they argue. (\"European Steel, Export Your Problems Away\", Aug. 24 2015)\n\nDEMAND WOES TRUMP SUPPLY WOES...FOR NOW\n\nSo, record high stocks after a period of super-fast production growth, a \"hard landing\" in usage from the Chinese stainless sector and a broader global stainless destocking cycle and you get a plausible explanation as to why nickel is back traipsing over chart territory last seen in 2008-2009.\n\nThe demand shock may not be as severe as during the Global Financial Crisis but the other parts of the fundamental picture, particularly those huge stocks, are arguably more price-negative than they were then.\n\nThe irony is that nickel's supply-demand dynamics really are tightening.\n\nThe Indonesian nickel ban has been in place for 21 months now, stopping the flow of the nickel ore that feeds Chinese NPI producers. Stocks of ore, particularly the high-grade ore that other countries such as the Philippines can't replace, are fast running out.\n\nJust about every Chinese NPI producer and a good many non-Chinese conventional producers have operating costs above current prices.\n\nJim Lennon, analyst at Macquarie Bank, told the Reuters Base Metals Forum last month he estimated 65-70 percent of nickel supply is currently losing money.\n\nAnd the supply response is building. Australian miner Mincor said it will slash production over the second half of this year, while Mirabela Nickel said it has slowed activity at its Brazilian mine.\n\nSmall Canadian producer First Nickel, which was already winding down operations due to low prices, has just gone into administration.\n\nTraders report a steady tightening in stainless scrap and ferronickel, both parts of the nickel market that exist beyond the light of exchange trading.\n\nNone of which is reflected in prices at their current distressed levels.\n\nRight now demand woes and fear of more to come are the overriding theme for nickel and just about every other commodity.\n\nBut while the talk in other markets is all about cost curve support and potential price-related closures, nickel is already there.\n\nNickel supply has been tightening ever since Indonesia cut off nickel ore supplies to China back in January 2014 and the list of price-related closures is lengthening.\n\nThis market has a reputation for preempting broader metal market trends. Remember it hit its \"supercycle\" peak in 2007, four years before copper.\n\nSo if you're looking for a turning point in the current cycle of metallic doom and gloom, keep an eye on apparently bombed-out nickel.",

The first one will give insight into why she joined Weight Watchers and her initial experience on the program.\n\nAlthough she's not revealing her starting weight, Simpson said in March that she weighed 170 pounds when she posed nude and pregnant for the April issue of Elle magazine. She's 5-foot-4.\n\nShe says Weight Watchers hasn't given her a goal or a percentage she has to lose. \"They want me to be healthy.\"\n\nWeight Watchers tells members that a healthy weight range for a person her height is between 117 and 146.\n\nShe says the extra pounds are coming off pretty quickly, but she won't reveal exactly how much she has dropped so far. \"I've lost weight every single week.\"\n\nSimpson is \"eating less of everything,\" but \"I don't believe in completely depriving yourself.\"\n\nSince joining Weight Watchers, she hasn't eaten macaroni and cheese. \"It's better not to have it at the moment.\"\n\nStill, she has to satisfy her cravings for chocolate. \"I'm a woman who wants her chocolate. I allot myself a fun-size (bag) M&Ms. I eat one of those, and my craving is satisfied. I don't need the whole bag of M&Ms.\"\n\nShe's following the PointsPlus program, which assigns points to foods based on the amount of protein, fiber, carbohydrates and fat in them. Fresh fruits and most vegetables are zero points, so members can eat as much of those foods as they want. At first, she was eating about 34 points a day on the program, but after she weaned her daughter off breast-feeding, her points dropped to 28.\n\nShe has Weight Watchers meetings in her home with her mom, Tina, and several good friends \u2014 14 people in all. By late August, they had collectively lost 160 pounds, she says. \"It's nice to do it together and motivate each other.\"\n\nBesides monitoring her food intake, Simpson says, she's doing about 60 minutes of cardio exercise a day, mostly walking, in preparation for getting in shape for the next season of NBC's Fashion Star. \"My boobs are way too big to run at this point. I'm just walking.\"\n\nShe wears a pedometer to track her steps. She's walking about 14,000 steps a day but started at 10,000. A mile is roughly 2,000 to 2,500 steps depending on stride length. Many health experts recommend that people try to do at least 10,000 steps a day.\n\nThe pedometer helps her keep track of how active she is and allows her to minimize her workout time and maximize her time with Maxwell, she says.\n\nJohnson is walking with her. \"We take Maxwell out a lot. \u2026 (Johnson) was really healthy when I met him, eating a vegetarian diet and very health conscious from being an athlete.\"\n\nHe has been supportive. \"I have his support but not pressure. The fact that he loves me the way I am right now \u2014 we're set. He knows I want to feel better in my skin.\"\n\nSimpson also is working with personal trainer Harley Pasternak about four to five times a week. She's doing short, simple body-toning workouts.\n\nFor years, there has been a lot of publicity about Jessica Simpson's weight cycling. \"My weight has always been something that people like to comment on. I've gotten used to it. It'll start to get boring at some point, I hope,\" she says.\n\n\"Nobody wants to talk about their weight. For me, I have had to come to a place where I am comfortable with myself. I'm a mom now, and get to be a role model for this beautiful little girl.\"\n\nGetting back into shape after pregnancy is challenging, but it's important for feeling confident and empowered as a woman, she says. \"I feel like everybody can do what I am doing.\n\n\"I'm not a supermodel. My body is not bouncing back like a supermodel. I'm just your everyday woman who is trying to feel good and be healthy for her daughter, her fianc\u00e9 and herself.\"",

    "text": "Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded. When the bohemian sculptor with the unlikely name moved into Springfield, Ill., in the closing days of 1860, his intended subject, the town\u2019s most famous resident, was getting ready to move out of the office he had occupied there for seven months. The approaching Illinois legislative session meant President-elect Abraham Lincoln\u2019s space would be re-claimed by the governor. Arranging formal sittings would not be easy.\n\nDisunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.\n\nBesides, Lincoln had already sat for a number of portrait artists, and with an inaugural address to write and worrisome Congressional compromise initiatives to derail, he now had other priorities on his mind. For all these reasons, when sculptor Thomas Dow Jones arrived from Cincinnati on a \u201cbitter, blustering, and freezing day,\u201d armed with a commission from Cincinnatians to execute his bust, Lincoln had ample reason to turn him down. A flamboyant fellow who sported wide-brimmed hats and shawls, Jones seemed an impertinent oddball anyway. The fact that he carried a letter of endorsement from Ohio\u2019s leading Republican, Salmon P. Chase, cut both ways at best: the egotistical senator was then leading Lincoln a merry dance about joining his Cabinet.\n\nWhat was more, Lincoln\u2019s only previous experience with a sculptor had been \u2014 literally \u2014 a pain. In extracting a hardened plaster life mask from his face a year earlier, he had inadvertently torn hairs from his temples, bringing involuntary tears to his eyes.\n\nJones was not to be denied. He tartly promised that his subject \u201cwas not to be assassinated through the custom of some sculptors in taking a cast of the face.\u201d Nor was venue a problem: the president-elect could simply sit at Jones\u2019s newly rented room at the nearby St. Nicholas Hotel. Astonishingly, Lincoln agreed. He would climb the four flights to Jones\u2019s studio daily, and pose there every morning while reading his daily mail \u2014 virtually until he left town for his inauguration in February.\n\nIn an era when official photographers routinely snap moment-by-moment pictorial records of presidents, it is difficult to imagine a busy leader devoting so much time to ensuring that his image was properly recorded \u2014 especially in a medium that required so many sittings, and promised such limited circulation.\n\nThen why did Lincoln consent? Perhaps until he found new office space he simply needed a place to roost. More likely his assent had something to do with his flourishing new beard. The whiskers he began cultivating after his election victory were finally beginning to assume recognizable form. And Lincoln had not changed his appearance so radically without an eye to recording and circulating the result. No written evidence exists to confirm this speculation, but Lincoln surely became the first successful presidential candidate to alter his looks after his victory in part to reassure his anxious country that he was more than a rugged railsplitter. Now he looked more like a dignified statesman equal to the daunting task awaiting him in Washington, and he no doubt wanted to enshrine the transfiguration. Besides, the national obsession over the beard was already diminishing hostile press reaction to Lincoln\u2019s frustrating policy of silence and \u201cmasterly inactivity.\u201d Here was a human interest diversion that enthralled the nation. \u201cOld Abe,\u201d one newspaper reported merrily, is \u201cputting on (h)airs.\u201d Why not shine the spotlight even more intensely?\n\nCommencing work in late December and early January, Jones initially found his abilities tested by the \u201chard and rugged lines\u201d of Lincoln\u2019s face. But the sculptor soon discovered that \u201ca good anecdote or story before commencing a sitting much improved the plastic character of his features.\u201d Thereafter, they began each session \u201cwith two or three anecdotes, each, and then went on with our work in silence.\u201d\n\nEnjoying daily access to Lincoln, Jones was uniquely positioned to observe the president-elect as he struggled to establish a new routine in the absence \u2014 for the first time since his nomination \u2014 of a capacious headquarters. Jones came to believe that his hotel became \u201cLincoln\u2019s only retreat from the pursuit of numerous applicants for office, where he could compose his addresses in peace.\u201d As Jones molded his clay, Lincoln labored away on letters and speeches \u2014 using pencils that he occasionally asked Jones to sharpen with his sculpting tools. He wrote on \u201ca small portfolio and paper resting on his knee, with a copy of his published speeches lying beside him for reference.\u201d It is likely he composed some of his inaugural journey remarks during these very sessions. Closely observing his famous subject, Jones managed also to record a unique narrative history of Lincoln\u2019s pressure-filled final days in his hometown.\n\nTending to correspondence was seldom a dramatic exercise, but one memorable morning, Lincoln discovered a \u201csuspicious\u201d package in his mail. Worried that the small box might contain \u201can infernal machine or torpedo\u201d \u2014 Lincoln\u2019s recent correspondence had been littered with death threats \u2014 he playfully considered soaking it in a tub of water or saying prayers over it. In the end, artist and subject together squeezed the parcel against \u201cthe back of the clay model . . . using it as an earthwork, so in case it exploded, it would not harm either of us.\u201d The idea of relying on a sculpture for protection was ridiculous, but fortunately what Jones and Lincoln found inside was a harmless whistle made from the tail of a pig.\n\n\u201cMr. Lincoln enjoyed the joke hugely,\u201d Jones recalled, though as hard as he puffed on it he was unable to make the device work. His youngest son, Tad, had more luck. Calling at the Lincoln home that evening, Jones found the little boy \u201cmaking the house vocal, if not musical\u201d with the novelty.\n\nAn unfolding history of the Civil War with photos and articles from the Times archive and ongoing commentary from Disunion contributors.\n\nAlthough Jones enjoyed unprecedented time with his sitter, the sculptor continued to find Lincoln \u201cthe most difficult subject that I have ever confronted.\u201d Ultimately, he concluded that he required help. Artists of the day were increasingly turning to the newer medium of photography to provide models to supplement life sittings. So on Jan. 13, Jones ushered Lincoln to Christopher S. German\u2019s nearby gallery to pose him for photographs.\n\nUnder Jones\u2019s guidance, German took a series of refined portraits against the elegant backdrop of a curtain swag tied back with gold tassels. Lincoln looked well-dressed, calm and elegant, if understandably distracted. Clearly visible was the \u201cvigorously\u201d flourishing beard he had been cultivating for six weeks.\n\nGerman gave prints to Jones, but also published and sold copies to the public, giving admirers a sneak preview of the future president\u2019s new look. As a result, the photos are often mistakenly remembered today as the main products of Lincoln\u2019s desire to record his changing appearance. In fact, they were made expressly as props for sculptor Jones. Photographs were still largely unappreciated as art, and celebrities who aspired to immortality knew that they would be remembered most heroically in paintings and statuary.\n\nTwo weeks later, Jones finally summoned the courage to invite Lincoln to comment on the bust. Lincoln \u201cexamined it very closely for some time,\u201d and then exclaimed in his quaint way: \u201cI think it looks very much like the critter.\u201d The local newspaper concurred, calling the work-in-progress \u201cthe best likeness of the President elect we have seen.\u201d\n\nBut Jones dawdled over the sculpture too long to get the credit he deserves for fashioning so singular an image of the president-elect as he looked just before assuming office \u2014 and for involving another medium in the project. Lincoln departed for Washington well before the artist completed his bust. As late as August, Jones was still residing in Springfield, fussing over the clay head. Not for years did a copy of his final effort earn an honored place in the Red Room of Lincoln\u2019s White House. The bust was eventually photographed as well and sold as souvenirs for family albums \u2014 bringing the image project full cycle. Mass-produced plastic replicas achieved far greater fame than the commissioned marble version, dedicated in 1871.\n\nSix years earlier, the once-overconfident sculptor had all but conceded his need for further training by asking President Lincoln for appointment to some Italian consulate where he could perfect his craft. The request was not as presumptuous as it may sound today. Artists of the day frequently asked for such patronage plums, and often got them.\n\nIn January 1865, Lincoln obligingly asked his secretary of state to find Thomas Dow Jones one \u201cof those moderate sized consulates which facilitate artists a little [in] their profession. Please watch for chances.\u201d Unfortunately, the president died before he could secure for Jones the reward he felt he deserved. Yet even without the Italian training he coveted, this enterprising Ohioan had succeeded in fashioning the last portrait from life of Abraham Lincoln as president-elect in Springfield, had commissioned the first photographs showing him wearing his iconic beard, and had recorded Lincoln\u2019s understandably fearful reaction to a prank that reminded him of his vulnerability to murder.\n\nJones later compared Lincoln to \u201ca rough block, of the old red primitive sand-stone \u2014 thoroughly tried by fire, and capable of enduring much more.\u201d Lincoln also had an uncanny understanding of the power of image-making and remained willing to suffer the time and inconvenience required to immortalize himself. In return, Jones proved capable of successfully portraying \u201cthe critter himself\u201d \u2014 as he looked bound for glory.\n\nJoin Disunion on Facebook \u00bb\n\nHarold Holzer is the chairman of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation and the author, co-author or editor of 36 books on Lincoln and the Civil War era, including Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech that Made Abraham Lincoln President and Lincoln President-Elect: Abraham Lincoln and the Great Secession Winter 1860-1861.

But putting fork to mouth is more complex than walking. \"A pedometer can't tell what kind of motion you're making. This tracks a very specific motion,\" Hoover says.\n\nThe wrist rotation necessary to move a fork from plate to mouth turns out to be the critical motion in eating; the machine counts bites with 90% accuracy, he says.\n\nIt also counts bites taken without the use of a fork or spoon, such as eating an apple; the rotation of the wrist is the same whether eating with the hands or utensils, Hoover says.\n\nHoover and his co-inventor, psychologist Eric Muth, have found that one bite generally averages about 25 calories.\n\nMuth says he eats about 80 bites a day \u2014 20 each at breakfast and lunch and 40 at dinner. But the healthy number of bites can vary from one person to another, he adds. \"The first thing is to make it obvious that they're eating more than they think. If they know that, the behavior change will come a little easier.\"\n\nStill, he says, you have to want to change.\n\nMarjorie Nolan, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, who was not involved in the device's development, says such a device could be helpful for some people. \"This would be a good tool for someone who generally knows what is healthy and unhealthy but maybe has more of an issue with portion control,\" she says.\n\nPatrick O'Neil, director of the Weight Management Center at the Medical University of South Carolina, is just beginning a study to determine how effective the Bite Counter may be in aiding weight loss.\n\nThe data aren't in yet, he says, but \"any approach people take in what we call self-monitoring \u2026 usually helps people control their intake.\"",

    "text": "When the cracked wooden floorboards of an old French goods train were prised from their carriages, black with oily grime from years of use, little can anyone have imagined that they would end up adorning the facade of a Cambridge college. But then the brutalist brick courts of Churchill aren\u2019t your usual precious medieval cloisters. Nor are the architects of its new accommodation block the kind to defer to the received wisdom of what an Oxbridge building should be.\n\n\u201cEyebrows were raised when we first suggested it,\u201d says Tom Emerson, director of 6a Architects, gesturing at the scarred, blackened oak that now adorns the walls of the college\u2019s \u00a310m new Cowan Court. \u201cBut when the dons realised this would be a first, they really got on board.\u201d\n\nThey were wise to take the plunge. They have ended up with a building that is a first in more ways than its unexpected cladding, namely a refined quadrangle of 70 student rooms that is at once rugged and delicate, a secluded garden treehouse that also speaks of the progressive spirit at the heart of the postwar college \u2013 a young institution in Cambridge terms, whose motto is simply \u201cForward\u201d.\n\nBuilt in 1959, Churchill College was the result of one of the most high-profile architectural competitions of its time, with a shortlist that reads as a roll call of the top practices of the day, including Denys Lasdun, Ern\u0151 Goldfinger and Alison and Peter Smithson. The final scheme, by Sheppard Robson, takes the form of 10 irregular brick quads, or \u201ccourts\u201d to use the Cambridge term, arranged in a staggered loop around a central open space. At the centre of it is the Winston Churchill archive (appended in 2002 with a boxy extension for the Thatcher papers) and the largest dining hall in the university, a great agora of eating topped with a barrel-vaulted roof. In the manner of a 60s comprehensive, the whole complex is crowned with a big concrete chimney \u2013 the college\u2019s fittingly no-nonsense take on a dreaming spire.\n\nAlmost 60 years on, these brick and concrete courts have sprouted a doppelganger, set apart from the loop, standing on its own like a cabin among the trees.\n\n\u201cI like to think it\u2019s the first wooden brutalist building,\u201d says Emerson, describing how the raw constructional logic of Sheppard Robson\u2019s concrete frame has been translated into the chunky timber posts of his own creation. Beams overshoot columns, with joints reminiscent of traditional Japanese joinery \u2013 the influence of project architect Takeshi Hayatsu. The rough board-marked concrete is beautifully echoed in the gnarled wooden cladding, making the whole thing feel like an inverted mould of the original, as if it has been made of the planks from which the 1950s complex was once struck.\n\nThe \u201cbrut\u201d of brutalism, Emerson reminds me, simply means raw or crude in French, and the building revels in its contrasts between the gnarled recycled timber and the lighter-coloured raw oak, used to line the ground-floor undercroft, where the form is sliced open like a kiwi fruit, revealing fresh flesh within.\n\nThe closer you get, the more such subtleties become apparent. There is a slight inward curvature in the facades, which softens between the three floors, making them look like a stack of nested cardboard boxes, sucked in like empty juice cartons.\n\nThe effect is emphasised by the floors\u2019 razor-sharp edges, separated by slender zinc plates, adding to the sense of paper-thin flatness. The top of the building is crowned with a simple frieze, milled into the planks to expose lighter wood beneath the blackened crust, a detail that will fade to a ghostly impression with time \u2013 as, hopefully, will the blonde ventilation panels either side of the playfully staggered windows, a contrast that for now feels a bit stark.\n\nEntering through the low undercroft, you emerge into a glade of silver birch trees \u2013 a patch of Scandinavia transplanted to the fens \u2013 which will one day poke up beyond the roofline, giving the surreal impression of a little forest in a box. Window-lined corridors wrap around the courtyard, looking on to this sylvan prospect, with deep window sills to perch on and social corner kitchens to encourage students to leave their rooms. You can see why it would be tempting not to, when you discover the spacious bedrooms with huge picture windows, deep window seats, exposed wooden beams and oak floors.\n\nIn a building type that often reeks of value engineering, plasterboard hutches stacked up in diagrams of efficiency, Cowan Court speaks of something that has been crafted rather than assembled \u2013 the process of making being a hallmark of 6a\u2019s work. \u201cArchitecture is a permanent battle against products,\u201d says Emerson. \u201cSo often, building is reduced to a process of specification, of choosing from a catalogue rather than making.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2001 with partner Stephanie Macdonald, the practice has been lucky enough to enjoy the kind of clients who have an interest in material craft and bespoke details. A favourite of the art world, 6a brought its light touch to the Raven Row Gallery in Spitalfields, east London, for Alex Sainsbury in 2009, then the South London Gallery in 2010 \u2013 where it has just completed a courtyard garden with artist Gabriel Orozco \u2013 and most recently to a studio in Notting Hill for Juergen Teller, creating an alluring world of concrete, white breeze blocks and brass fittings.\n\nLike their Churchill building, the Teller studio is composed around a series of courtyard gardens, designed here like mini overgrown bomb sites, with native plants sprouting up between the cracks of smashed-up concrete. Gardens, it emerges, have become the central idea to Emerson\u2019s thinking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to think we got it wrong when we said there\u2019s a natural world and an artificial one,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole world is a garden, with buildings placed in it.\u201d It is an idea he has been pursuing with his students at ETH Z\u00fcrich, where, having spent the last few years building big wooden structures with the look of medieval siege towers, he has now commandeered a chunk of land on campus to cultivate a garden.\n\n\u201cI realised that the one thing missing from architecture school is the simulation of time,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no prehistory.\u201d The current year\u2019s cohort are busy building landscape structures, pathways, drainage, compost heaps and storage for tools, which will be successively developed over the years \u2013 with the one rule that you can add to, but not destroy, what went before.\n\nEmerson sees the teaching, which necessitates a substantial chunk of time away from the firm\u2019s Bloomsbury studio (where he is busy working on everything from a new gallery in Milton Keynes to a pair of apartment blocks in Hamburg), as a \u201cvehicle for pursuing hunches\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really say to a client, \u2018Do you mind if I use your project to have an existential inquiry into the meaning of nature?\u2019\u201d But it\u2019s these inquiries that make the work of 6a, and the world it inhabits, a much richer place.",

There\u2019s really never a need for it.\n\nToday, I need to apologize, because Missouri\u2019s offensive linemen have provided us with a video that\u2019s just too good to pass.\n\nTwerking, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with the term, is a provocative form of dancing involving \u201cthrusting hip movements and a low squatting stance.\u201d\n\n(Man, I feel my soul warping and dignity slipping away by the word here.)\n\nAt a recent Mizzou practice, a horde of burly lineman decided to twerk as their fellow Tigers roared in laughter. The song playing in the background is \u201cWiggle,\u201d by Snoop Dogg and Jason Derulo. No, it\u2019s not clear why they would ever do this or who would put them up to it.\n\nHere\u2019s the regrettable but, yes, hilarious video:\n\nTHREE THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\n1. Some crucial news out of Norman: Oklahoma is attempting to suspend linebacker Frank Shannon, its leading tackler last season, for one year after an internal Title IX investigation into sexual assault allegations revealed Shannon violated the school\u2019s sexual misconduct penalty. University president David Boren released a statement Monday afternoon, saying, \"The University is unable to enforce its process at this time. The University has and is taking every legal step possible to move this process forward.\u201d\n\nOklahoma can\u2019t immediately suspend Shannon because he has the right to appeal the ruling to a district court. Barring an unforeseen victory for Shannon, it appears the Sooners will have to do without him in 2014. Sophomore Jordan Evans is one likely candidate to fill the spot.\n\n2. And some unfortunate news in Eugene: Oregon starting left tackle Tyler Johnstone re-tore his right ACL and will miss the season. Johnstone originally tore it in last season\u2019s Alamo Bowl against Texas and was working back from that injury in hopes of playing this fall. Junior Andre Yruretagoyena played with this first team this spring while Johnstone was out and will likely start at LT when the Ducks open their season against South Dakota on Aug. 30.\n\n3. Someone hung a Johnny Manziel Texas A&M jersey on Bear Bryant\u2019s statue outside Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa. If that\u2019s not a first-degree felony, then just end all laws forever.\n\nTHREE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW\n\n1. West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen is gonna get dinged a little bit for this: Speaking to the media on Monday, he said, \u201cI know you lie in recruiting a bunch, and that\u2019s just part of it.\u201d It\u2019s really not anything new or controversial, though. Who doesn\u2019t already assume coaches lie in recruiting?\n\n2. Stewart Mandel dropped in on Ohio State in Columbus and wrote about the revamped defense under new co-defensive coordinator Chris Ash and how it will likely be the development on that side of the ball that allows the Buckeyes to be playoff contenders (or not). Everyone wants to see Ohio State\u2019s front seven, because it could be among the best in the country with DEs Noah Spence and Joey Bosa and DTs Adolphus Washington and Michael Bennet along the defensive line, followed by a deep LB unit behind them. Count me in that group as well, but I\u2019m more eager to see the Buckeyes secondary fly around in a way we probably haven\u2019t seen from them.\n\n\u201c[Meyer] said he wanted a defense that challenges the offense, that\u2019s aggressive, that will attack, not worry about the \u2018what ifs,\u2019 create confusion,\u201d Ash told Mandel. \u201cThose are things I believe in to be successful. When he started talking my language, I started listening.\u201d\n\n3. Colorado State locked Jim McElwain into a new five-year contract that runs through the 2018 season, which includes a base salary of $1.5 million and an initial buyout of $7.5 million. Without knowing the specifics, it seems like a great deal for CSU. McElwain, who previously worked as Nick Saban\u2019s offensive coordinator at Alabama, is a rising name among young head coaches and would have gotten interest this offseason from bigger programs if the Rams matched or improved on their 8-6 season (including a New Mexico Bowl win) of 2013.\n\nBut $7.5 million is hefty buyout figure. For reference, James Franklin\u2019s Vanderbilt buyout was $1.5 million when he left for Penn State and Charlie Strong\u2019s Louisville buyout was $4.375 million when he left for Texas. So McElwain is going to be in Fort Collins for a while, which isn\u2019t a bad thing at all if it fits him and his family.\n\nTHREE THINGS YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW\n\n1. After superb Florida State defensive back Jalen Ramsey was kicked out of practice on Sunday for being too physical and disobeying coach Jimbo Fisher\u2019s orders, the sophomore was back at practice on Monday after a meeting with his coach. \u201cHe got upset, I got upset \u2013 that\u2019s ball and we move on,\u201d Fisher said. Good to hear. Ramsey is too talented a guy to not be on the field this season for something so silly.\n\n2. I\u2019m not one to go crazy for teams unveiling new uniforms \u2013 we\u2019ve reached the overkill stage of that particular recruiting tactic \u2013 but I kinda like these new San Jose State helmets. Simple, yet they stand out.\n\n3. SI\u2019s Martin Rickman outlines three \u201capocalyptic scenarios\u201d for the first college football playoff. If you\u2019re a fan of insanity, you\u2019re a fan of Marshall this season.\n\n* Good read from Michael Casagrande on T.J. Yeldon, a quiet Alabama star who\u2019s not one for attention.\n\n* I know Ice Bucket Challenge videos are everywhere now -- and we had USC coach Steve Sarkisian's in Monday's CFB AM -- but this one with Virginia Tech's Frank Beamer is delightful.\n\nHave a great Tuesday, all.\n\nTeddy Mitrosilis is an editor and writer for FOXSports.com.

He was 81.\n\nJohn Henry Johnson, left, with quarterback Bobby Layne, a fellow Hall of Famer, in 1962. Layne called him \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy bodyguard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe 49ers announced Johnson\u2019s death but did not report the cause. He was found to have Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 1989, The Plain Dealer of Cleveland reported in 1999, when his wife, Leona, enrolled him in a research program for the disease while they were living in Cleveland.\n\nPlaying halfback and fullback, Johnson, 6 feet 2 inches and 210 pounds or so, looked to intimidate opposing linemen by charging directly at them, and when he did not run over them, he used his quickness to cut and then head downfield.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to scare your opponent,\u201d Johnson was quoted by Lew Freedman as saying in \u201cPittsburgh Steelers: The Complete Illustrated History.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sort of upsets their concentration. I find I can run away from a lot of guys after I get them afraid of a collision with me.\u201d\n\nIn his first three seasons in the National Football League, Johnson teamed with quarterback Y. A. Tittle, fullback Joe Perry and halfback Hugh McElhenny, all four of them future Hall of Famers, in the 49ers\u2019 Million Dollar Backfield of the mid-1950s. They played long before six- and seven-figure salaries, earning the nickname for their offensive prowess.\n\nAfter three seasons with San Francisco, Johnson was traded to the Lions in 1957 and led them in rushing yardage when they won the N.F.L. championship that season.\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s best seasons came while playing for the Steelers from 1960 to 1965. He became the first Steeler to gain 1,000 yards rushing in a season, exceeding that milestone twice.\n\nWhen he retired after the 1966 season, playing his final year with the Houston Oilers of the American Football League, Johnson was pro football\u2019s No. 4 career rusher, behind Jim Brown, Jim Taylor and his former 49er teammate Perry, who died in April at 84. A four-time Pro Bowl player, Johnson was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987.\n\nJohnson was born on Nov. 24, 1929, in Waterproof, La., but grew up in the Bay Area. After playing at St. Mary\u2019s College in California and at Arizona State, he was the Steelers\u2019 second-round draft selection in 1953. He played one season for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League, then joined the 49ers.\n\nIn his rookie year, Johnson was the runner-up for the N.F.L. rushing title, behind Perry, whom he often sprang with his blocks. He was also formidable in protecting quarterbacks.\n\n\u201cJohn Henry is my bodyguard,\u201d the star passer Bobby Layne, who played with Johnson on the Lions and the Steelers, once remarked, as related by NFL.com. \u201cHalf the good runners will get a passer killed if you keep them around long enough. But a quarterback hits the jackpot when he gets a combination runner-blocker like Johnson.\u201d\n\nJohnson ran for 6,803 career yards, averaging 4.3 yards a carry. He scored 48 rushing touchdowns and 7 as a receiver.\n\nHis survivors include five children, The San Francisco Chronicle said. Johnson\u2019s bruising play as a runner and a blocker impressed his teammates, but it brought mixed feelings for at least one of his offensive linemen when the 49ers would approach an opponent\u2019s goal line.\n\n\u201cI just hoped there would be a hole there, because if there wasn\u2019t, John was running up my back,\u201d the star offensive tackle Bob St. Clair told The Contra Costa Times in 2006. \u201cI could feel those cleats going up to my spine, and into the end zone he\u2019d go.\u201d",

    "text": "Denard Span dug into the batter\u2019s box last night for the first plate appearance of the night, the start of a game plan, the first link in the chain. Span\u2019s arrival, particularly in tandem with Jayson Werth hitting behind him, has given the Nationals a new kind of offensive identity. They aim to wear down starting pitchers and attack the soft underbelly of bullpens by forcing as many pitches as possible.\n\nSpan has made his impact felt in an obvious way so far, reaching base in 15 of 30 plate appearances after he went 2 for 3 with a walk in Tuesday night\u2019s 8-7 victory by the Nationals. Just as important, though, has been the manner in which he has made the opposing starter expire. Last night provided a perfect template of how Span\u2019s addition could change the Nationals.\n\nIn his first at-bat, Span saw eight pitches against Jake Peavy before he flied out to center. He would see 19 pitches over his four plate appearances, including 14 of the 100 that Peavy threw over 5 1/3 innings. On the season, Span has seen 4.29 pitches per plate appearance. Behind him is Werth, who has seen 4.4 pitches per plate over his career, making him one of the active leaders. It all starts with Span, siphoning drops of water and waiting for the dam to break.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of the pitches seen and the on-base percentage,\u201d Werth said. \u201cIt really sets a tone for the offense. You get a guy like that up top, he\u2019s seeing all those pitches, he\u2019s making the pitcher work. So not only are guys behind him getting a chance to see what the pitcher has got, but he\u2019s taxing the pitcher. He gets more at-bats than anybody else. As the game goes on, you go through a lineup, you\u2019re going to have to, as a pitcher, have to get through the lineup. It\u2019s going to be tougher for him. He\u2019s throwing more pitches. He\u2019s got to throw more pitches that mean more. It\u2019s not, flip something up there and get a first-pitch out. He\u2019s got to work to get through the lineup.\n\n\u201cOver the course of the game, by the time you get to the third time through, the guy\u2019s throwing a lot of meaningful pitches. Hopefully, his pitch count is up. You got a chance of seeing that sixth-inning [reliever], that seventh-inning guy. Over the course of a season, you see a sixth-inning guy in the bullpen, you see him more times than not, you\u2019re giving your team a chance to win a higher percentage than not. Usually, the sixth-inning guy in a bullpen \u2013 not necessarily in our case \u2013 but for most teams, that guy is the guy you want to see.\u201d\n\nLast night, Peavy faced the minimum through three innings, with the help of Bryce Harper and Gio Gonzalez both getting thrown out trying to stretch singles into doubles.(Manager Davey Johnson, by the way, said both attempts were good risks with two outs.) At the start, Peavy was dealing. He fired an incredible front-door two-seam fastball over the inside corner to Adam LaRoche, which left LaRoche standing straight up. The next batter, Ian Desmond, struck out looking on a two-seamer that broke with severity over the outside corner of the plate\n\nThe Nationals still had a zero on the board after three, but they were achieving what they wanted. They were getting a look at Peavy, and they were taxing him by making him throw high-stress pitches.\n\n\u201cWhen that pitcher gets to two strikes, he\u2019s got to throw a meaningful pitch to get you out,\u201d Werth said. \u201cDenard is flipping balls, fouling them off or getting a base hit with two strikes, spitting on a nasty ball in the dirt. That\u2019s one pitch that guy had to throw max effort that he didn\u2019t get anything out of. Now he\u2019s got to throw another one. Over the course of a season, over the course of a game, even the top guys in the league, you get them to throw those meaningful pitches, those max-effort pitches, that should be strike three, should be outs, and they\u2019re nothing. You go through a whole season, a whole six months of guys doing that, it plays in our favor. It makes everybody else in our lineup better.\n\n\u201cBy the time you get to Harp and Zim and LaRoche, you\u2019ve thrown a lot of pitches,\u201d Werth added. \u201cThat takes a toll. Chances are, you\u2019re not going to be as sharp as the game goes on. You might leave one over the plate. You might leave one up. The guys we\u2019ve got hitting 3-4-5-6, those guys can do damage to pitches like that.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals started chipping away. Span sparked a rally in the fourth with a single up the middle, moving to third on Harper\u2019s single and then scoring on Zimmerman\u2019s sac fly. In the fifth, Desmond found a pitch Peavy left over the plate and smoked it into the bullpen. The quality of Peavy\u2019s pitches began to waver.\n\nBy the sixth, the Nationals started to batter him. Span, again in the middle of it, led off with a double. After a meeting on the mound, Werth pounced on a first-pitch fastball and launched it into the left field seats. Zimmerman walked, and LaRoche delivered the knockout blow, a home run to right that made it 6-2. The dam had broken.\n\nAnd then the Nationals got what they really wanted \u2013 a look at Chicago\u2019s middle relief. They added two more runs off a combination of four pitchers, and they needed all eight after the Nationals\u2019 bullpen faltered.\n\n\u201cYou make guys throw pitches and work,\u201d Werth said. \u201cYou get them to work early in the game. By the third time around, their pitch count is up. They\u2019re more tired than they were the first couple innings. That\u2019s when you get \u2018em. It\u2019s a pretty good game plan.\u201d\n\nSpan is at the tip of that spear. His value will become more apparent over the season. That eight-pitch at-bat to start the game resulted immediately in an out. By the end, it had helped contribute to the deterioration of a starter\u2019s night. When they continue their series Wednesday, the White Sox will have used more than half their bullpen. The impact of a leadoff hitter shows not only in his on-base percentage or scoring runs, but in the corrosive effect he has on the other team.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ve been missing,\u201d LaRoche said. \u201cNot necessarily a guy that sees pitches, because Jayson sees more pitches than anybody in the league. But a guy who\u2019s constantly on base. We\u2019ve got a small taste of it here. I think over the course of a year, you\u2019re going to see the difference that can make.\u201d\n\nAdam LaRoche\u2019s breakout night allowed the Nationals to hold to an 8-7 win over the White Sox, James Wager writes.\n\nNats to bring Rizzo back in \u201914\n\nSyracuse 8, Buffalo 2 (5 innings): Chris Marrero went 2 for 3 with a home run and a triple. Corey Brown went 2 for 3 with a double. Ross Ohlendorf allowed two runs in five innings on five hits and three walks, striking out four.\n\nNew Britain 9, Harrisburg 7: Destin Hood went 3 for 5 with a triple. Brian Goodwin went 1 for 4 with a walk. Anthony Rendon went 1 for 3 with a walk. Steve Souza went 1 for 1 with four walks. Brian Broderick allowed three runs in six innings on eight hits and no walks, striking out three.\n\nPotomac 12, Salem 4: Billy Burns went 3 for 4 with a walk and is hitting .550.

    "text": "Always a hero to his fans, Bruce Springsteen this week became a hero to those struggling with depression.\n\nThank you, Bruce Springsteen. You\u2019ve been the ultimate musical hero to millions of music lovers, and a populist hero to work-a-day Americans, whose dreams, needs, and concerns you\u2019ve given voice to in songs that speak to every generation.\n\nNow you\u2019re a hero for a different reason; you\u2019ve got us talking about depression. Not just the \u201cI\u2019m depressed today\u201d kind of depression, but the kind that locks you in a dark closet of isolation and despair and doesn\u2019t let you out.\n\nSpringteen spoke out about depression to David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, in an epic 15,000-word feature that has Remnick shadowing Springsteen for months, engaging in deeply intimate conversations along the way. Remnick spoke with Springsteen\u2019s wife, singer Patti Scialfa, and his bandmates, as well as the 62-year-old rock star himself.\n\nSo why am I jumping on the bandwagon and adding yet another voice to the coverage? Because when the Boss talks about struggling with suicidal thoughts, a painful childhood, a family history of mental illness, and a decades-long struggle with clinical depression, it opens doors. Doors to a discussion that for some reason America is still having trouble having.\n\nHonestly, at this point I don\u2019t know why depression is still something we hide. But it is. And so are other types of mental illness, some more \u201cacceptable\u201d to admit to than others, but all considered something shameful, rarely to be discussed with friends, neighbors, coworkers. (And don\u2019t even mention prospective employers. Let\u2019s be honest, many of us seek mental health treatment privately \u2013 despite the fact that we have insurance to pay for it \u2014 because we don\u2019t want there to be any chance our workplace could find out.)\n\nAnd it\u2019s too bad, because depression \u2014 and its dark stepchild, suicide \u2014 desperately needs to be talked about. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 1 in 10 Americans has diagnosable depression, and six percent of the population reported being treated for a major depressive episode in the past 12 months.\n\nToday, suicide is the third leading cause of death for 15- to 24-year-olds. Did you know that? Almost no one does, it seems. Even in communities like mine, where teen suicide tragedies have made headlines every year for the past five years, the subject is met with hushed comments and quick changes of subject.\n\nThen there\u2019s the difficult subject of other mental illnesses \u2013 and Bruce took that on. too. He told Remnick his father was bipolar, but frequently discontinued taking medication, leading him subject to episodes of rage that were very frightening for Springsteen as a young boy.\n\nAt the time Born in the USA made Bruce Springsteen an international star, he was struggling with severe depression.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think I\u2019m right in saying our society still stigmatizes mood disorders and other types of mental illness, look at the kinds of personal challenges we regularly share, and those we don\u2019t.\n\nFor example, in a recent support group I attended, women suffering from eating disorders discussed how they\u2019re more comfortable telling friends and schoolmates that they\u2019ve been hospitalized for anorexia or bulimia than for bipolar disorder or depression. (And yes, in case you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m owning up to my own family tree which includes depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorders and anxiety disorders.)\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe me, ask those who\u2019ve been \u201c5150-ed\u201d for suicidal thinking or a suicide attempt whether they\u2019ve told friends about the incident, or lied about where they were.\n\nAnother thing that distinguishes Springsteen\u2019s admission from the routine celebrity drama of the week is that he\u2019s a man. And while women are often at least somewhat public about depression (i.e. Brooke Shields) , men are not.",

    "text": "Noor Inayat Khan led a very unusual life. She was born in 1914 to an Indian Sufi mystic of noble lineage and an American half-sister of Perry Baker, often credited with introducing yoga into America. As a child, she and her parents escaped the chaos of revolutionary Moscow in a carriage belonging to Tolstoy\u2019s son. Raised in Paris in a mansion filled with her father\u2019s students and devotees, Khan became a virtuoso of the harp and the veena, dressed in Western clothes, graduated from the Sorbonne and published a book of children\u2019s tales \u2014 all before she was 25.\n\nOne year later, in May 1940, the Germans occupied Paris. Khan, her mother, and a younger brother and sister fled like millions of others, catching the last boat from Bordeaux to England, where she immediately joined the British war effort. In 1942, she was recruited by Churchill\u2019s elite Special Operations Executive (SOE) to work in Paris as a wireless operator. Her clandestine efforts supported the French Underground as England prepared for the D-Day invasions. Among SOE agents, the wireless operator had the most dangerous job of all, because the occupation authorities were skilled at tracking their signals. The average survival time for a Resistance telegrapher in Paris was about six weeks.\n\nKhan\u2019s service continued from June 1943 until her capture and arrest by the Gestapo in October. Her amazing life and eventual murder in Germany\u2019s Dachau prison camp in September 1944 are the focus of a PBS film I co-produced that is airing this week. In researching her story, I came across quite a number of other Muslims who bravely served the Allied cause \u2014 and sometimes made the ultimate sacrifice. History is rich with examples of their daring heroism and split-second decisions that helped defeat the Nazis.\n\nBehic Erkin, the Turkish ambassador in Paris, provided citizenship papers and passports to thousands of Jews (many with only distant claims to Turkish connections) and arranged their evacuation by rail across Europe. One fateful day, Necdet Kent, the Turkish consul-general in Marseille, stymied the shipment of 80 Turkish Jews to Germany by forcing his way onto a train bearing them to their likely death and arranging for their return, unharmed, to France.\n\nAbdol-Hossein Sardari used his position at the Iranian consulate in Paris to help thousands of Jews evade Nazi capture. Later dubbed the Iranian Schindler, he convinced the occupying Germans that Iranians were Aryans and that the Jews of Iran had been Iranian since the days of Cyrus the Great \u2014 and, therefore, should not be persecuted. Then he issued hundreds of Iranian passports to non-Iranian Jews and saved their lives.\n\nAhmed Somia, the Tunisian co-director of the French Muslim Hospital outside Paris, organized weapon caches, facilitated Resistance radio transmissions, treated wounded Resistance fighters, and helped save many downed U.S. and British pilots by hiding them in fake T.B. wards where Gestapo and French gendarmes feared to go.\n\nKhan was posthumously decorated with the highest British and French civilian and military honors, but so were other Muslims, including standout heroes among the 2.5 million British Indian troops fighting Axis forces around the globe. In this largest volunteer army in recorded history, Muslims (roughly one-third of the force), like Hindus and Buddhists, played prominent roles. In a letter to President Roosevelt during the war, Churchill pointed out that Muslim soldiers were providing \u201cthe main army elements on which we [the British] must rely for the immediate fighting.\u201d In 1944-45, the French Army of Africa, joined to de Gaulle\u2019s Free French Forces, was expanded to 260,000 men, of whom 50 percent were North African, the great majority being Muslim, while another substantial group were Senegalese Muslim riflemen. These forces invaded Italy and helped liberate southern France. According to American historian Juan Cole, fighting these dark-skinned Africans in \u201cAryan\u201d Europe, and losing to them, dismayed many German soldiers steeped in trumped-up theories of racial inferiority.\n\nEastern Europe offered more examples. In the Balkans, for instance, only 200 Jews lived in Albania before WWII. Yet by war\u2019s end, almost 2,000 Jews lived in the country, because so many had fled Greece, Austria and other locations in Europe to take shelter there among the predominantly Muslim population, which hid and protected them.\n\nAs Cole wrote elsewhere, commemorating the 70th anniversary of D-Day: \u201cWhile a few Muslims did support the Axis, out of resentment of Western colonialism and hopes that the rise of an alternative power center would aid their quest for independence, they were tiny in their numbers compared to the Muslims who not just supported the Allies\u2026 but actively fought on their behalf.\u201d\n\nOne of the jobs of documentary film is to rescue stories that fall out of the history books. Khan\u2019s account, and others like it, seems at odds with the history of the modern Middle East, whose combatants \u2014 whether Arab, Turkish, Iranian or Israeli \u2014 may want for their own reasons to bury stories about Muslim-Jewish collaboration. But these tales should be remembered and honored. It is my sincere hope that with the story of Noor Inayat Khan, we have done just that.\n\n\u201cEnemy of the Reich: The Noor Inayat Khan Story\u201d will air on PBS stations nationwide on Tuesday, September 9th.

    "text": "Bashar Masri, 54, looks pensive as he sits in the gleaming, glass-walled luxury apartment showroom of Rawabi, a brand new Palestinian city he has built from scratch.\n\nRawabi is the first planned town to be built in the West Bank. The futuristic, hi-tech and eco-friendly town, which welcomes its first residents this month and eventually aims to house up to 40,000 people cost $1.2 billion, provided by the Qatari Diar real estate firm and Masri\u2019s own Massar International real estate firm.\n\nMasri is today one of the richest men in Palestine, an accomplished real estate magnate and entrepreneur who frequently meets international leaders, from the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nBut his wealth and polished appearance betrays little of his past as an angry youth growing up in the West Bank city of Nablus and his stints in Israeli prisons. He was born in 1961 and Israel invaded the West Bank and ended Jordanian control in 1967. As he grew up, Masri found himself in confrontation with Israeli soldiers who patrolled his home town and enforced Israeli rule.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, I believed in violence\u201d, Masri says. \u201cI was active in my high school, planning demonstrations and writing letters to the U.N. Secretary General Kurt Waldheim at the time, protesting the occupation and voicing the fact that we are Palestinians and nothing else but Palestinians. At that time, we weren\u2019t even recognised as Palestinians\u2026.. Saying that you are a Palestinian under occupation was enough to send you to prison; carrying a Palestinian flag was enough to be shot dead on the spot and so we were revolting against that. So that was my activism.\u201d\n\nMasri was arrested for throwing rocks and spent a few nights in a cell in 1975 when he was 14 years old. By the time he was 16, another stint behind bars meant he missed his exams. After his release, his father sent his son to finish high school in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nHe went on to study chemical engineering and management in American and British universities. But when the first intifada broke out in 1987, he returned home. Masri says this time he did not throw any stones. \u201cAt that stage, I wasn\u2019t going out in demonstrations. I was more on the planning side,\u201d he says.\n\nMasri continued to work abroad and return home periodically until 1991 when he arrived at Israel\u2019s Ben Gurion airport and was deported. \u201cI was handed a paper from the Israeli Minister of the Interior, saying that I am a security risk to the state of Israel. If there was a Bin Laden then, I would have thought I was Bin Laden,\u201d he says. He was allowed back in 1994.\n\nAfter finishing his studies, Masri made his fortune working in real estate deals in Morocco, Libya, Jordan and Egypt, and also worked as a management consultant in London, Saudi Arabia and Washington DC.\n\nThe time away from home gave Masri a chance to reflect on what was happening in the West Bank. He thought about his previous visits home, meeting his former classmates who had been high achievers at school. But in the years following graduation, there were few jobs. \u201cThey were in a pathetic situation \u2013 no jobs, nothing to do,\u201d he says.\n\nEncouraged by the 1994 Oslo Accords, and eager to come back, Masri said he became determined \u201cto help build a nation and give opportunities to my people.\u201d The way to do so, he decided, would be to build Rawabi, a new town, which would provide cheaper accommodation than nearby Ramallah and employment for local people.\n\nAt first, the project was halted due to the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000, but in 2011, ground was broken and construction began. Today, the city is one of the largest job providers in the West Bank, employing approximately 10,000 people. Of its engineers and architects, one-third are women.\n\nYet the price for building Rawabi meant co-operation with Masri\u2019s erstwhile enemy \u2014 Israel, which continues to occupy the West Bank.\n\nIn the course of building the city, Masri shook hands with numerous Israeli army generals, politicians and businessmen in order to facilitate the construction of the city, build access roads and deliver building supplies. He has faced criticism from some Palestinians who criticise him for \u2018normalising\u2019 the occupation. \u201cAll Palestinian factions and nongovernmental institutions, as well as all the Palestinian people, have made a decision to boycott the occupation forces, which is something that should apply to everyone, including Rawabi, \u201d Wasel Abu Yousef, a senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organisation told the al-Monitor website.\n\nBut Masri is not ashamed about his co-operation with Israeli businesses. \u201cI\u2019ll say one thing: our relationship with Israeli companies is very good \u2013 we\u2019re not hiding it, we\u2019re not ashamed of saying this,\u201d he says.\n\nBut despite the succes of Rawabi, which could not be built without Israeli support and goods, Masri is not optimistic about the current political situation. \u201cYou need two to tango and I don\u2019t think we have two that can tango right now,\u201d he says.\n\nBut as tensions between Israelis and Palestinians endures, Masri says affordable, good quality housing and jobs could help provide an alternative to violence. \u201cNobody who wants to hurt someone else would buy an apartment and would come to live in a city like this,\u201d he says.",

    "text": "Danvers high school teacher Colleen Ritzer is seen in this undated photo provided by her family. Photograph: AP\n\nWhen I was 16, I was put on what police call a \"School Hit List\". A student, one year younger than me, ranked and ordered 10 of us in terms of killing priority. I don't remember much more about that traumatizing time except that I was number 7 on that list and one of my favorite teachers was target no 1.\n\nIt's hard to believe that event had little bearing on my choice to enter the educational profession, but 15 years later (and in my 8th year as a teacher), I occasionally look out into the masses of current and former students and wonder \u2013 could something like that ever happen again? And, better yet, could it happen to me?\n\nThese thoughts and questions were dredged from the depths of my memory this week \u2013 two days, two teachers murdered.\n\nThe first of these tragedies occurred on Monday. Mr Michael Landsberry's is a story of heroism, as he lived a life of being \"in the line of duty\". While on recess duty, eyewitnesses reported gun shots rang out from a 9mm handgun, injuring two students. Most fled for safety, but Landsberry, an 8th grade math teacher, casually approached the shooter to reason with him. Minutes later, he was tragically shot. After serving his country in the armed forces for most of his life, he was gunned down by a 12-year-old boy on an outdoor basketball court at Sparks Middle School, Nevada.\n\nMr Landsberry is my hero; if something like that ever happened at the middle school I teach at \u2013 one not too different from his \u2013 I'd hope to have half the courage and composure he exhibited not just on that day, but for his profession, his students, and his ultimate sacrifice.\n\nOn Wednesday, Massachusetts experienced a similar loss. Ms Colleen Ritzer was allegedly murdered by a 14-year-old student in her last class of the day. This young man stabbed her to death in the school's bathroom with a box knife, dragged her body out of the school in a recycling bin, and dumped her remains in a nearby forest. According to the local CBS affiliate, Ritzer asked the boy to stay after class to talk about how he was struggling with his math.\n\nMs Ritzer's beaming smile seemed only to be overshadowed by her kindness towards students and her love of math. She was an avid Twitter user (@MsRitzerMath), and her tweets seem indicative of her fondness for her profession. One from 11 August is telling:\n\nHowever, the big question remains: how many more teachers have to be slaughtered and slain, leaving behind a wonderful legacy before we take action? Cari Harris, a fellow teacher, said it best in a blog post on The Educator's Room:\n\nWell, considering that teachers now face the danger of being killed while doing their jobs, perhaps it's time we focus a little more on how to support our educators in real and authentic ways.\n\nIn every community in the free world, we have one thing in common \u2013 schools serve as the epicenter. It's a place for our children, their growth, and our collective future. Schools help fashion and forge the next generation, and I \u2013 like surely Mr Landsberry and Ms Ritzer were \u2013 am proud to serve my community as a teacher. Our profession shoulders a vast responsibility, but a rewarding one.\n\nAs a teacher, I find it so difficult to think about the gun shots in the searing heat of Landsberry's Nevada playground and the struggle Ritzer faced in a faculty bathroom on a dark autumn evening in Massachusetts, but find it more difficult that most of the public has already moved on; ready for the next story. I could only imagine Mr Landsberry paid this same penitence as an active duty soldier, but he traded his weapons for a different set of tools \u2013 hope, awareness, encouragement, and education.\n\nBuilding these tools in every teacher, every community, and every student, are perhaps the only way to make for a safe school that is destitute of hatred, violence, and Hit Lists. I certainly don't want any other teacher to ever ask themselves \u2013 could something like that ever happen again? And, better yet, could it happen to me or my students?\n\n\u2022 This commentary was amended on 26 October 2013 to clarify that Michael Landsberry taught in Nevada and was killed on Monday.",

    "text": "Mandela, who is 94 years old, was taken to a hospital in the capital early Saturday to be treated for a recurring lung infection. At that time, Zuma\u2019s office described the anti-apartheid leader\u2019s condition as \u201cserious but stable.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, members of Mandela\u2019s family were seen visiting the hospital where the anti-apartheid leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate is believed to be staying.\n\nThe African National Congress, South Africa\u2019s ruling party, dismissed as false a report in Monday\u2019s edition of The Star newspaper that Mandela\u2019s family had barred senior party leaders and government officials from visiting the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe have spoken to the family about this report and they deny that they issued such an instruction or (have) spoken to the media on barring the ANC and government from visiting Madiba,\u201d the party said in a statement, using Mandela\u2019s clan name.\n\n\u201cWhat we know is that given the pressure associated with the admission of President Mandela, there are general restrictions that permit only relevant people to have access,\u201d the party said. \u201cAs the ANC, we have deferred this responsibility to President Zuma to liaise with the family and the hospital.\u201d\n\nOn April 29, state television broadcast footage of a visit to Mandela\u2019s home by Zuma and other ANC leaders. Zuma said then that Mandela was in good shape, but the footage - the first public images of Mandela in nearly a year - showed him silent and unresponsive, even when Zuma tried to hold his hand.\n\nSome South Africans said that showing images of a clearly ailing Mandela was inappropriate and appeared to reflect an attempt by the ruling party to benefit politically from its association with Mandela, a former ANC head, in the runup to national elections next year. The party denied the accusation.\n\nMandela has been hospitalized several times in recent months. During a hospital stay that ended April 6, doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia and drained fluid from his chest.\n\nMandela has been particularly vulnerable to respiratory problems since contracting tuberculosis during 27 years as the prisoner of the white racist government. The bulk of that period was spent on Robben Island, off the coast of Cape Town where Mandela and other prisoners spent part of the time toiling in a stone quarry.\n\nMandela was freed in 1990 and won election to the presidency in the country\u2019s first all-race elections in 1994. He was seen by many around the world as a symbol of resolve and reconciliation for his sacrifice in confinement as well as his peacemaking efforts during the tense transition that saw the demise of the apartheid system.\n\nThe former leader retired from public life years ago and had received medical care at his Johannesburg home until his latest transfer to a hospital.\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Thank them. Blame them. Curse them. Relish them.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t create competitive eating,\u201d said Jason Fagone, the author of \u201cHorsemen of the Esophagus,\u201d a 2006 book about competitive eating with a title wiped from George Shea\u2019s lips. \u201cThey just commercialized it. They\u2019re the ones that took this low-key American tradition and turned it into a business and a spectacle.\u201d\n\nBorn in Boston and raised mostly in Maine in a family of five children with no known history of timed binge eating, George and Rich Shea are college-educated public-relations professionals who grew up more familiar with the hot dog contest in \u201cMeatballs\u201d than the one in Coney Island.\n\n\u201cLet me be very clear,\u201d George Shea said recently in the federation\u2019s Midtown Manhattan office with a serious tone and the hint of a smirk. \u201cRegardless of the fact that we wear the straw hat, we were not in \u2018The Music Man\u2019 in high school.\u201d\n\nThey were not the onstage type.\n\n\u201cWe were in the basements of friends listening to the Smiths and R.E.M.,\u201d Rich Shea said. \u201cWe were not extroverts.\u201d\n\nGeorge said: \u201cI did a magic show at 12. It was poorly received.\u201d\n\nGeorge Shea graduated from Columbia in 1986, an English major \u201cwith no direction or prospects,\u201d he said. He worked for Max Rosey and Mortimer Matz, New York public-relations veterans with a penchant for stunts like the Nathan\u2019s contest. Through most of the 1970s and 1980s, that meant mustering a few heavyset competitors and a few dozen spectators. It was a success if newspapers ran photographs. Rosey died in 1991.\n\n\u201cI was very interested in keeping that contest going,\u201d George Shea said. \u201cIt was an account. Very small account. Really small. But it was a classic New York thing. You can\u2019t let it go.\u201d\n\nNow the brothers conduct more than 80 eating contests each year, most not involving hot dogs. They have an archive of about 150 eating records, including those for cow brains, cheese steaks, candy bars, cabbage, cannoli, crab cakes, corn dogs, cranberry sauce, crawfish and calamari \u2014 to name some starting with \u201cC.\u201d About 250 eaters compete exclusively under their Major League Eating banner, though only Chestnut and Takeru Kobayashi of Japan make a living from overeating. Chestnut is set to defend his title, but Kobayashi may not appear Sunday because of a dispute with M.L.E.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about standing in front of Nathan\u2019s with Max Rosey,\u201d said Wayne Norbitz, who began working there in 1975 and has been its president since 1989, \u201cand a card table with a couple plates of hot dogs in the mid-\u201970s, and I see what this has evolved into, I\u2019m totally flabbergasted by it.\u201d\n\nRich Shea, who graduated from Villanova with an English degree and held a couple of advertising jobs, soon joined his brother\u2019s company, Shea Communications. Most of their public-relations work has been for serious clients.\n\nThey started the federation as a diversion, giving it an over-the-top logo (winged lions whose mouths are stuffed with the ends of a hot dog, and a Latin inscription that means, \u201cIn gorging, truth\u201d) and the mock-serious name of International Federation of Competitive Eating, or I.F.O.C.E. (\u201cWe kept the \u2018O,\u2019 \u201d Rich said straight-faced with a shrug. \u201cOftentimes in an acronym, they drop the \u2018O.\u2019 \u201d). In 1999, they added a partner, David Baer, and now have three other full-time employees.\n\n\u201cIf someone from The Sun in London came and said, \u2018Mate, we\u2019d like to do a French fry contest, do you have one?\u2019 \u201d Rich said. \u201cWe\u2019d go, \u2018In fact, we have one on Friday!\u2019 We\u2019d find a place and have a French fry contest.\u201d\n\nCompetitive eaters were usually local people who entered a contest on a dare. Spectators were mostly passers-by. Shtick created the spectacle.\n\n\u201cBack then, you couldn\u2019t say, \u2018This guy is the jalapeno, ice cream and chocolate eating champion of the world,\u2019 \u201d George said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019d say, \u2018His stomach is a caldron in which food is cooked by the heat of his liver!\u2019 \u201d\n\nGeorge, married with a son and a daughter, as is his brother, peppers his routine with literary references. He has been known to send the same letter to a friend year after year, or leave notes in books knowing they may not be seen for years.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t really care if it\u2019s funny to anyone else, as long as it\u2019s funny to him,\u201d said Kevin Pearce, a longtime friend.\n\nRich Shea is the more improvisational humorist, his deadpan perfect for television banter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible that anyone could dream up this scenario,\u201d Pearce said of the Sheas\u2019 career arc. \u201cBut it does not surprise me that George, in particular, was able to take his absurd sense of humor to some crazy level. And I\u2019m not surprised that it resonates with people.\u201d\n\nEverything changed on July 4, 2001, when Kobayashi nearly doubled the existing record by eating 50 hot dogs. Competitive eating received worldwide coverage. ESPN began televising the Nathan\u2019s contest in 2004.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit of a departure from a standard stick-and-ball sport, but it is something that our fans understand in that it is a July 4 tradition,\u201d said Jason Bornstein, the senior director for programming at ESPN. \u201cAnd it is something that only the experts in the field can deliver to us in a way that we understand.\u201d\n\nThose experts are George and Rich Shea. The rise of competitive eating has led to books, more televised events, even other eating leagues.\n\n\u201cThey should get full credit for that,\u201d Norbitz said. \u201cI had nothing to do with that, and others at Nathan\u2019s had nothing to do with that. They recognized something that was going on with the Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest, and they had this insight that this could be developed beyond Nathan\u2019s. And, in fact, they created this league around it, which is really crazy, right?\u201d\n\nAlmost as crazy as stuffing 68 hot dogs and buns down the gullet in 10 minutes.",

Now an ambitious digital documentation project is allowing scholars and art-lovers alike to pore over the minute details of Jan and Hubert van Eyck's multi-part painting in a specially-designed, open source website entitled 'Closer to Van Eyck: Rediscovering the Ghent Altarpiece.'\n\nConsisting of 12 panels (one of which is a copy, the original having been stolen in 1934) and depicting numerous complex theological scenes, the documentation project has rendered the already composite work into 100 billion pixels using the highest resolution photography.\n\nA collaboration between the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage in Lukasweb, Belgium, and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and funded with support from the Getty Foundation in Los Angeles and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, the venture to digitally document the work took 9 months, initially to assess it for conservation.\n\n\"And then it grew into 'These results are interesting, how can we share this information with the widest possible audience on a website?'\" said Deborah Marrow, Director of the Getty Foundation.\n\nThe documentation process -- which made use of macrophotography in visible light, macrophotography in infrared light, infrared reflectography and X-radiography -- probed beneath the painted surface to reveal the under-drawings.\n\nIt's technically an amazing feat that they were able to juxtapose the regular image, as you would normally see it, with the under-drawingAntoine Wilmering, Getty Foundation\n\n\"One of the big open questions surrounding the polyptych is the involvement of Hubert van Eyck, the older brother of Jan van Eyck, in the production of the painting,\" said Ron Spronk, Professor of Art History at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, who led the project.\n\n\"We ought to look for Hubert's hand in the under drawings of the panels, which were revealed with infrared macrophotography, and with infrared reflectography,\" he explained.\n\nEntirely open-source, the website that came out of the documentation process is now live and accessible to art-lovers as well as scholars, allowing users not only to zoom in on tiny details of the work, but also to go beneath the surface of the paint and see how the composition evolved over time.\n\n\"At the Getty Foundation, we've always supported the less sexy things that go on behind the scenes of great public projects -- conservation, research, planning -- things that are really crucial but less visible,\" said Marrow.\n\n\"But recently we've made a greater effort to take the results of those behind-the-scenes activities and make them more immediately available to a wider public,\" she continued.\n\n\"It's technically an amazing feat that they were able to do this so precisely and present the images in such a way that you can juxtapose the regular image, as you would normally see it, with the under-drawings,\" said Antoine Wilmering of the Getty Foundation.\n\nWhile the website has a wide appeal, he said, it will also be an invaluable tool for the next generation of scholars.\n\nThe Ghent Altarpiece has kept scholars, very different types of scholars, busy for centuriesRon Spronk, Professor of Art History at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario\n\n\"The last conservation on the altarpiece took place in the 1950s with a little bit of work done in the '80s, and the technology was not as advanced as it was today,\" he said.\n\nThe Altarpiece is to undergo a full, five-year-long restoration treatment beginning in September 2012.\n\nThe panel will be disassembled in three stages, and the parts being restored will be taken to the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, where the public will be able to view the treatments taking place from behind a pane of glass.\n\nSpronk, who lived with the altarpiece for six months while documenting it, told CNN: \"The Ghent Altarpiece has kept many scholars -- and very different types of scholars for that matter -- busy for centuries, and will doubtless continue to do so.\"\n\nHe believes the website will open up a \"whole new world\" for scholars who have toiled for years either working from color reproductions or from the work itself.\n\nStill, Spronk concedes that it is no substitute for seeing the work in person.\n\n\"What you can't show on a website is the sheer monumentality of the altarpiece, the incredible realism of the painting,\" he said.\n\n\"When you are looking eye to eye with the Deity... It's hard to explain, but I can see why the polyptych still grips so many people,\" he said.\n\nSee the Ghent Altarpiece up close on the Closer to Van Eyck website, or visit it in person at St. Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium.",

    "text": "U.S. forces killed another to ISIS leader this week, but experts say removing top officials won\u2019t be enough to take the terror organization down.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition against ISIS confirmed the death on Tuesday of one of the group\u2019s biggest operatives, Omar al-Shishani. The Georgian national, who is also known as Omar the Chechen, is believed to have died from injuries sustained in a U.S. airstrike earlier in March.\n\nBut while killing top ISIS officials is sure to negatively affect the organization, it\u2019s unlikely to be decisive. Patrick Skinner, special projects director of the Soufan Group, a private intelligence firm based in New York, says that ISIS has become so large that, like al-Qaeda, killing even its top leader won\u2019t bring it down. \u201cThey are not going to fall apart if they lose one person,\u201d Skinner says.\n\nThe assassination campaign has also been a victim of its own success. ISIS has filled the roles of slain leaders who, like Shishani, have been targeted during airstrikes over the past few months. But according to Skinner, the replacements won\u2019t be announced because doing so would cause \u201cthat person to become a target.\u201d\n\nThat said, experts have identified other top ISIS leaders who remain on the coalition\u2019s hit list. Still at large are:\n\nThe group\u2019s leader and self-proclaimed caliph has played an instrumental part in creating and gathering new supporters for ISIS. The shadowy figure, who has a $10 million bounty on his head, has revealed little about himself, reportedly wearing a mask while addressing fighters. He is thought to be 44 years old. Compared to Shishani, who was a decorated military man, al-Baghdadi \u201cis not the main military figure in ISIS,\u201d according to Omar Ashour, a lecturer in security studies at the University of Exeter and an associate fellow at Chatham House. Instead, Ashour says the ISIS leader\u2019s strengths lie in theology\u2014al-Baghdadi received a PhD in Islamic studies\u2014while also symbolizing the successes of ISIS\u2019s expansion from Mosul in Iraq to Aleppo in Syria. His skill at warping Islam for his own ends have enabled ISIS to recruit thousands members and helped justify the group\u2019s trademark atrocities in the eyes of some believers.\n\nThis senior ISIS operative was one of the oldest members of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), an al-Qaeda offshoot started by the notorious Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who masterminded the Sunni insurgency in Iraq and created the foundation of what would become ISIS. Al-Qaduli, like al-Baghdadi after him, served as al-Zarqawi\u2019s right-hand man before Zarqawi was killed in an airstrike in 2006. In 2012, al-Qaduli allegedly escaped from prison and joined the early iteration of ISIS, since becoming a second-in-command to al-Baghdadi. According to the BBC, he is alleged to have acted as ISIS\u2019s leader when al-Baghdadi was wounded in an airstrike in March. There has been an unconfirmed report of his death during an airstrike in Tal Afar, Iraq, but the Department of Justice continues to offer up to $7 million for any information his whereabouts. \u201cMany allege that he is one of the main figures of ISIS,\u201d says Ashour of al-Qaduli. \u201cHe is certainly the most experienced.\u201d\n\nThe 38-year-old Syrian from the northwestern city of Idlib became the senior spokesman for the group in 2014.

    "text": "Prime Minister David Cameron's office said Thursday it would be legal under humanitarian doctrine to launch a military strike against Syria even without authorization from the United Nations Security Council.\n\nThe office added that the legal conditions have been met for taking action against Syria for launching a chemical attack against civilians in a Damascus suburb last week. The British leader has been at the forefront of calls for action, but his push is expected to be slowed by objections from the opposition Labor Party and a standoff at the U.N.\n\nCameron's office released intelligence and legal documents meant to bolster the case that chemical weapons were used by the Syrian government and that retaliation would be justified. The documents were made public in advance of a debate in the British Parliament.\n\nThe Labor Party will oppose the resolution in Parliament, according to a party official who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of Labor leader Ed Miliband's announcement.\n\nIn addition to a legal summary, Downing Street released the Joint Intelligence Committee assessment that concludes it was \"highly likely\" that the Syrian government was responsible for the chemical weapons attack on Aug. 21 that killed hundreds of civilians.\n\nJon Day, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, says in the report that assessments indicate the Syrian government had already used chemical weapons on a smaller scale since fighting escalated in 2012.\n\n\"A clear pattern of regime use has therefore been established,\" he said.\n\nCameron's office said: \"The judgment of the Joint Intelligence Committee is that a chemical weapons attack did occur in Damascus last week; that it is highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible; that there is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability; and that no opposition group has the capability to conduct a chemical weapons attack on this scale,\" said a summary released by Cameron's office.\n\nSyrian officials have denied responsibility for the chemical assault.\n\nThe British legal report indicates the basis of Cameron's assertion that military action against Syria would be permissible under international law even if it is not specifically authorized by the U.N. Security Council.\n\nBritain has proposed a resolution to authorize the use of military force, but Russia and China remain firmly opposed and there is no indication of whether it will ever be put to a Security Council vote. British officials did not expect the resolution to be endorsed given the staunch opposition.\n\n\"The government's position on the legality of any action makes clear that if action in the U.N. Security Council is blocked, the U.K. would still be permitted, under the doctrine of humanitarian intervention, to take exceptional measures, including targeted military intervention in order to alleviate the overwhelming humanitarian suffering in Syria,\" the summary states.\n\nIt says the three necessary requirements for \"humanitarian intervention\" have all been met: There is convincing evidence of extreme, large scale humanitarian distress; there is no practical alternative to the use of force if lives are to be saved; and the use of force must be proportionate and aimed at relieving a human crisis.\n\nThe report says the Syrian regime has been killing its civilians for two years -- with reported deaths passing 100,000 -- and can be expected to use chemical weapons repeatedly unless action is taken.\n\nThis position that a strike would be legal has been rejected by some legislators who say they can only back the use of force if the Security Council has approved it.\n\nThe intelligence committee said there was no credible intelligence to suggest the attack was faked by opposition forces and that no rebel group had the capability for such a large-scale chemical attack.\n\nSyrian officials Thursday took the unusual step of writing to British legislators denying any role in the attack. In a letter to his counterpart in London, Jihad Allaham, speaker of the Syrian People's Assembly, invited British legislators to come to Syria to investigate the attack.\n\nHe implored British legislators to oppose the use of force in Thursday's vote: \"We ask you to stop the rush to reckless action,\" he said, asserting that a military strike would breach international law.\n\nCameron has already bowed to Labor Party demands that Parliament be required to vote a second time before any military strike against Syria would be launched.\n\nLabor leader Miliband insists that any military actions must be delayed until after the report of a United Nations inspection team is heard. The inspectors plan to leave Syria Saturday after collecting evidence about the alleged chemical attack.\n\n\"We have got to learn the lessons of Iraq because people remember the mistakes that were made in Iraq and I am not willing to make those mistakes again,\" Miliband said, according to Reuters.\n\nConservative officials are reportedly furious at the delay, accusing Miliband of opportunism.\n\n\"Ed Miliband is playing politics when he should be thinking about the national interest and global security,\" a Conservative source told Reuters. \"He keeps changing his position, not out of principle, but to achieve political advantage,\" the source added, saying Cameron wanted to \"do the right thing\" in the right way.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Britain is to send six RAF Typhoon air-to-air interceptor jets to its Akrotiri base in Cyprus on Thursday, the Ministry of Defense said. Cyprus is just 62 miles from the Syrian coast. Britain also has warships in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nClick for more from Reuters.",

(Before you start yelling \"spoilers!\" remember that most reviews of the film came out more than a week ago, and Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel has been on shelves for two years.)\n\nEarning $38 million, \"Gone Girl\" is director Fincher's biggest debut ever, easily surpassing the $30 million \"Panic Room\" opened with in 2002.\n\nThough most horror films have suffered at the box office this year, new release \"Annabelle\" bucked the trend. With an opening weekend bow of $37.2 million, the movie quintupled its $6.5 million budget and nearly knocked the higher-profile \"Gone Girl\" out of top spot.\n\nThe fright flick is a prequel to last year's \"The Conjuring,\" so that connection may have helped -- and if there's a month when horror movies figure to score, it's October.\n\nThe weekend's other major release, \"Left Behind,\" was even darker in tone, depicting a world literally gone to hell after the Rapture. Nicolas Cage assumes the Kirk Cameron role in the latest big-screen take on the postapocalyptic Christian novels.\n\nCritics savaged the thriller, but enough moviegoers turned out to give it a decent debut of $6.9 million, finishing just outside the top five.\n\nThere was some laughter, light and heroism to be found at theaters as \"The Boxtrolls,\" \"Dolphin Tale 2\" and the Energizer bunny of 2014 movies, \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" held strongest at the box office.\n\nMarvel's \"Guardians\" spent its 10th straight weekend in the top 10, increasing its total domestic box office take to $323 million. If twisted relationships, possessed dolls and the end of the world aren't your cup of cinematic tea, it's reassuring to know a talking tree named Groot will still be around for a while.\n\nDomestic weekend box office estimates from Exhibitor Relations Co.

It's expensive. There isn't central control over the process,\" said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.\n\nExperts say there's no evidence that the errors lead to fraud on Election Day. \"The perception of the possibility of fraud drives hyper-partisan policymaking,\" said David Becker, director of Pew's election initiatives. But inactive voters do cost money. Inaccurate lists mean wasted money on mailings and extra paper ballots.\n\nIn Wood County, Ohio, home of Bowling Green State University, there are 106% as many registered voters as there were people in the 2010 Census. \"We can't explain it, but obviously having a major university here creates challenges to having our voter-registration list cleaned up,\" elections director Deborah Hazard said.\n\nNearly 2.8 million people are registered to vote in more than one state. Number of people registered in: Two states \u2014 2,688,046 Three states \u2014 68,725 More than three states \u2014 1,807 Source: Pew Center on the States\n\nThe 1993 National Voter Registration Act, known as the \"motor voter\" law, made it easier for people to register to vote by, for example, allowing them to register when they get a state driver's license.\n\nThat same law also made it more difficult to remove someone from the voting rolls. Unless officials have a death certificate or written confirmation from the voter that they've moved, a voter must miss two presidential elections \u2014 that's eight years \u2014 before they can be removed.\n\nThe problem is particularly bad in swing states, where parties, campaigns and others canvass the state registering voters, even if they're already registered, and often collecting inaccurate information, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted said. \"Everybody's registering you here,\" he said. \"We don't really have control of that.\"\n\nHusted is asking the U.S. Justice Department for guidance on how to clean up the rolls before the presidential election without violating motor voter. \"It undermines voter confidence and creates the potential for voter fraud where people could act and vote on their behalf,\" he said.\n\nPew's solution: create a multistate data center to give officials voter registrations, motor vehicle records and death certificates from other states, allowing them to spot records that could be removed. That effort is starting this year with Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Virginia and Washington.\n\n\"This gives election officials more control over their lists,\" Becker said. Even so, the motor voter law still applies: \"Nothing happens automatically, and even more importantly, it requires something affirmative from the voter.\"\n\nHazard said Ohio has a similar system to catch voters who die in Ohio, or move within the state. But if a voter moves or dies elsewhere, they can remain on the rolls for years.",

    "text": "WSJ Washington Bureau Chief Jerry Seib joins The News Hub to explain why most likely path to a big budget deal is from the bottom up.\n\nAs Laurel and Hardy might say, this is another fine mess Washington has gotten us into.\n\nThe country remains in great need of a \"big deal,\" a comprehensive budget fix that starts to curb spending on the entitlement programs that are poised to really drive up the deficit, while also overhauling the nation's tax code to make it more economically efficient and internationally competitive. That's what all the energy and political drama of the past two years should have produced.\n\nGOP Sen. Rob Portman was part of a special deficit-cutting panel.\n\nInstead, Washington has brought forth merely a series of half-steps and patches, the newly launched sequester being only the latest.\n\nThose half-measures not only fail to address the real problems, but worse yet, actually may have made it more difficult politically to get a big deal done in the short term.\n\nThe half-deals have squandered political capital and removed some of the legislative lubricants needed to get the wheels rolling toward a big deal.\n\nStill, hope springs eternal. Conversations with leaders from both parties in recent days suggest it's possible that the sequester\u2014that set of automatic spending cuts that now will hit disproportionately military programs that Republicans protect and social-service programs cherished by Democrats\u2014will prove so grating over time that it may push the parties back toward a big deal.\n\n\"The objective here ought to be not just to deal with the sequester but to deal with the underlying spending problem, which requires tax reform and entitlement reform,\" says Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), who was part of a special panel that searched for a big deficit-cutting deal.\n\nAnd if that is to happen, the most likely path is from the bottom up, from rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans in Congress who begin to drive the process toward a big deal.\n\nIn other words, the best hope for a big deal may be if the followers start leading the leaders.\n\nWhat's frustrating about the past two years is that the two parties have wasted so much energy to underachieve.\n\nIt's best to think of the past two years of endless budget wrangling as a series of four piecemeal measures, none of them satisfactory.\n\nFirst, there was the early 2011 budget deal that cut $38 billion in federal spending as a way to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nThen, after months of tumultuous and largely unsuccessful negotiations, Congress passed later that summer the Budget Control Act that raised the debt ceiling in return for caps on discretionary spending. That deal also set the clock ticking toward the now-notorious sequester, if a broader deficit-reduction deal wasn't put in place.\n\nThen came 2012's year-end fiscal-cliff deal, which raised taxes on top-income Americans and put off the sequester for two months so some more intelligent deal on spending could be pursued.\n\nFinally, on Friday, the sequester kicked in, hitting the military hardest, but doing very little to address automatic Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid payments.\n\nIt's true that these measures, taken together, have helped bring down the short-term deficit. But they have done so almost entirely by cutting the kind of spending that already is in decline, which is on military and domestic discretionary programs that Congress has to approve every year.\n\nThey have done very little to address the long-term drivers of the deficits, which are the big, autopilot entitlement programs that pay out benefit checks no matter what. Worse, these half-measures of the past two years actually may have made the quest for the comprehensive deal politically harder. Here's how:\n\nBy squeezing the wrong kind of spending, the deals are wasting political capital that ought to be spent convincing Democrats to accept curbs in spending that matters, on entitlements.\n\nBy dealing with the revenue question piecemeal, the deals have wasted political capital that might otherwise be spent convincing Republicans that they could accept more in tax revenue overall, if that came in return for a real overhaul of the tax code that would generate more economic growth.\n\nBy putting into effect spending cuts that seem both meaningful and painful, the deals have wasted political capital that ought to be spent conditioning the public for the kinds of gradual but meaningful reductions in benefits paid by Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\n\nThe danger now is that Democrats have endured all the spending pain they are willing to tolerate, and Republicans have taken all the revenue-raising pain they are willing to accept, without ever getting to either entitlement or tax overhauls.\n\nCertainly Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) say they are done with revenue increases.\n\nSo now, maybe the compromises that add up to a big deal may be better worked out elsewhere. The House Ways and Means Committee, for instance, has set up a series of working groups to begin devising an overhaul of the tax code. Maybe these things now are best done at a low level out of the spotlight rather than at the top, under the klieg lights.\n\nWrite to Gerald F. Seib at jerry.seib@wsj.com\n\nA version of this article appeared March 5, 2013, on page A4 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: How (Maybe) to Reach an Elusive Budget Deal.",

King has passed away at his home in Las Vegas, aged 89.\n\nThough the world will miss this giant of guitar gifts, no one can say that King didn't devote his life to sharing his music with the masses. With 43 studio albums and a tour schedule that kept him performing at least 100 shows a year into his 70s, King was one of the few seemingly tireless artists who never got sick of performing for his legions of devoted fans.\n\nKing also knew the value of collaborating with other artists, releasing two albums late in his career devoted to duets: 1995's \"Lucille and Friends\" and 2005's \"B.B. King and Friends,\" as well as an entire album of duets with Eric Clapton, 2000's \"Riding With the King.\" He always seemed to be at the top of his form when singing with someone else, using his virtuoso picking and muscular voice as a counterpoint, or using the call-and-response form borrowed from the gospel tradition.\n\nWhether he was teaming up with folk legends like Tracy Chapman, blues pioneers like John Lee Hooker, or rock stars like The Rolling Stones, B.B. King always brought out the best in himself and others, making us smile even when he was singing the blues.\n\nAnd finally, a short clip of B.B.

    "text": "\u201cTo be called a sellout in Zimbabwe is to be condemned to death.\u201d This observation delivered with a dry, matter-of-fact tone comes late in the director Camilla Nielsson\u2019s outstanding, unsettling documentary \u201cDemocrats,\u201d a film that chronicles recent efforts to put a constitution into place in that country.\n\nShot over three years, the movie begins with archival footage and on-screen text that do a good job of acclimating viewers who may not be familiar with the political situation in Zimbabwe. Here\u2019s the short version: Since the country gained independence in 1980, it\u2019s been ruled by the autocrat Robert Mugabe. In 2008, compelled by international scrutiny over what many saw as a sham election, Mr. Mugabe was forced to share power with his rival, Morgan Tsvangirai. That situation led to the formation of a committee to draft a constitution that would push the country\u2019s government closer to a Western-style democracy.\n\nMs. Nielsson and her crew had exceptional access to the two men steering the constitutional process: Paul Mangwana, representing ZANU-PF, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s party; and Douglas Mwonzora, a representative of the Movement for Democratic Change (M.D.C.). Both men are lawyers, and they each make a great show of being happy warriors, as it were, and approach each other with often deferential friendliness. But an indication of how big a struggle one side faces comes early on. At an outreach session held in a rural province, an unusually large number of citizens proclaim that only the president ought to be permitted to appoint judges.\n\nWhat is happening here? Are the Zimbabweans of the old school, veterans of the war that won their country its independence, so flush with nationalist pride that they revere Mr. Mugabe so? Or is the whole process being rigged by Mr. Mugabe\u2019s secret service? Ms. Nielsson\u2019s handling of the events silently stresses that there are no simple answers to those questions.\n\nThe fits and starts of the process put the opposing representatives, both charismatic fellows, through some fascinating changes. Mr. Mwonzora winds up in jail during a particularly crucial point of constitutional drafting, while Mr. Mangwana haplessly finds himself in that dangerous position of being termed a \u201csellout\u201d later on. Ms. Nielsson\u2019s cameras take us only so far behind the scenes; Mr. Mugabe\u2019s own conference rooms are never entered. But the portrait of passionate people struggling to improve their government is urgent, vivid and satisfactory. Both inspiring and upsetting, \u201cDemocrats\u201d is, finally, a film that deserves to be called \u201cnecessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocrats\u201d is not rated. It is in English and Shona, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes.",

    "text": "JACKSON, Ga. \u2014 Georgia executed a 72-year-old man, its oldest death row inmate, early Wednesday for the killing of a convenience store manager during a robbery decades ago.\n\nBrandon Astor Jones was pronounced dead at 12:46 a.m. Wednesday after an injection of the barbiturate pentobarbital at the state prison in Jackson. He was convicted in the 1979 shooting death of suburban Atlanta store manager Roger Tackett.\n\nJones declined to make a final statement in front of witnesses but agreed to have a prayer read.\n\nGeorgia doesn't announce exactly when lethal injections begin, and the injection isn't visible to observers. But the warden left the execution chamber at 12:30 a.m., and records from past executions show the lethal drug generally begins to flow within a minute or two of the warden's departure.\n\nJones was initially still with his eyes closed and then swallowed a couple of times and moved his head slightly. He opened his eyes at 12:36 a.m. and turned his head to his left, appearing to look toward a clock hanging on the wall. Then he closed his eyes again and took a few deep breaths before falling still.\n\nThe execution had initially been set for 7 p.m. and was delayed while the U.S. Supreme Court considered appeals from Jones' attorneys. They asked the justices to block the execution for either of two reasons: because Jones was challenging Georgia's lethal injection secrecy law or because he said his death sentence was disproportionate to his crime.\n\nAround 11 p.m. Tuesday, the court denied the requests for a stay.\n\nThe challenge to Georgia's strict execution secrecy law sharply divided the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday. The law classifies the identifying information of any person or entity who participates in an execution as a \"confidential state secret.\"\n\nJones' lawyers argued the state's execution method carries \"a substantial risk of significant harm,\" violating his constitutional right against cruel and unusual punishment. But because of the secrecy law, they argued, they don't have enough information to make that claim, which violates his constitutional right to due process.\n\nThree-judge panels of the 11th Circuit had already rejected similar arguments, setting a binding precedent. But because of divided opinions expressed by judges on those panels, Jones' lawyers asked the full 11-judge court to consider their arguments. The court on Tuesday voted 6-5 to deny that review, but several judges offered strongly worded dissenting opinions.\n\n\"Today Brandon Jones will be executed, possibly in violation of the Constitution. He may also be cruelly and unusually punished in the process. But if he is, we will not know until it's too late - if ever,\" wrote Circuit Judge Robin S. Rosenbaum, adding that she believes the secrecy law denies Georgia death row inmates of their due process rights and may deprive them of their right to access to the courts.\n\nAccording to evidence at his trial, Jones and another man, Van Roosevelt Solomon, were arrested at a Cobb County store by a policeman who had driven a stranded motorist there to use a pay phone about 1:45 a.m. on June 17, 1979. The officer knew the store usually closed at midnight and was suspicious when he saw a car out front with the driver's door open and lights still on in the store.\n\nThe officer saw Jones inside the store, prosecutors have said. He entered and drew his weapon after hearing four shots. He found Jones and Solomon just inside a storeroom door and took them into custody. Tackett's body was found inside the storeroom.\n\nTests showed each man had recently fired a gun or handled a recently fired gun, prosecutors said. The cash drawer had been removed and was found wrapped in a plastic bag.\n\nJones was convicted in October 1979 and sentenced to death. A federal judge in 1989 ordered a new sentencing hearing because jurors had improperly been allowed to bring a Bible into the deliberation room. He was resentenced to death in 1997.\n\nSolomon, who was also convicted and sentenced to death, was executed in Georgia's electric chair in February 1985.",

Their charge is to chronicle American culture by telling the stories, large and small, that collectively make us what we are.\n\nWe also publish weekly columns by Al Neuharth, USA TODAY's founder, and DeWayne Wickham, who writes primarily on matters of race but on other subjects as well. That leaves plenty of room for other views from across the nation by well-known and lesser-known names alike.\n\nAs America approaches the 50th anniversary of John F.

As custodians of our heritage, we must uphold the American values of freedom, equality and opportunity for all.\n\nFor the past four years, it has been my honor to serve as speaker of the House, to follow in this tradition, and to work with my colleagues on behalf of the economic and national security of every American. Today, I will turn the gavel over to the new speaker, John Boehner, with my full commitment to join him in solving problems for America's families. When Republicans put forth solutions that reflect our priorities and address our nation's challenges, they will find in Democrats a willing partner.\n\nAs we pivot into a new Congress, our No. 1 priority will continue to be putting people to work. And we will measure each proposal by a simple test: Will it create jobs? Will it strengthen our middle class? Will it reduce the deficit?\n\nThe Democratic Congress and President Obama acted to lay a strong foundation for our nation's prosperity. We took action to create and save millions of jobs, and cut taxes for every worker. Our historic health insurance reform enacted a Patient's Bill of Rights, and Wall Street reform brought the greatest consumer protections in history.\n\nWe made the largest commitment to making college more affordable, and established landmark investments in the health and education of our veterans. These initiatives were all paid for; in the case of health reform and student loans, these actions will save taxpayers $1.3 trillion.\n\nHealth care reform and Wall Street reform increased leverage for America's working families. Any efforts to repeal or defund them will be met with stiff resistance. For the sake of all Americans, these protections must remain in place.\n\nIn the new Congress, Democrats are prepared to join congressional Republicans in focusing on job creation and strengthening our future. At this time of continued economic challenge, one place to start would be our \" Make It In America\" strategy \u2014 a series of steps to bolster America's manufacturers and our competitiveness so that we continue to lead the world economy. By creating jobs in our manufacturing and clean energy sectors, and making critical investments in our infrastructure, we can keep America No. 1. And with our plan, we can do so in a fiscally responsible way.\n\nNow is the time for Republicans to join us in offering bold ideas to continue our recovery and to keep our promises to generations to come. Together, we must act to meet the challenges of the moment and of our country's future: creating a strong and growing workforce, ensuring a thriving middle class, and acting as responsible stewards of the public purse.\n\nAs we congratulate Speaker Boehner and our Republican colleagues, we stand ready to solve problems and to find common ground on behalf of all Americans.

    "text": "Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, the author of \"Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad\" and a director at the New America Foundation. Jennifer Rowland is a program associate at the New America Foundation.\n\n(CNN) -- On the evening of March 19, Tom Clements, the director of Colorado's prison system, was shot and killed when he answered the door of his home near Colorado Springs.\n\nThe slaying sparked a police chase that ended a few days later in Texas, with authorities finally killing the suspect, 28-year-old Evan Ebel, in a shootout. It was soon discovered that Ebel had been part of a violent white supremacist gang during the eight years he spent in Colorado prisons.\n\nClements was the latest victim of increasingly active violent right-wing extremists. While American politicians and the U.S. public continue to focus on the threat from jihadist extremists, there seems to be too little awareness that this domestic form of political violence is a growing problem at home.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2007, only nine right-wing extremists were indicted for their roles in politically motivated murders and other types of ideologically motivated violent assaults. But between 2008 and 2012, the number mushroomed to 53, according to data collected by the New America Foundation.\n\nFifteen right-wing extremists were indicted in 2012 -- including six who were involved in a militia in Georgia that accumulated weapons, plotted attacks on the government and murdered a young U.S. Army soldier and his 17-year-old girlfriend, who they suspected were planning to rat out the group to authorities. Seven claimed membership in the anti-government Sovereign Citizens movement and allegedly murdered two policemen in Louisiana. And two had gone on a murderous rampage the previous year, killing four people before they were arrested in California, where they told police they were on their \"way to Sacramento to kill more Jews.\"\n\nBy comparison, in 2012, only six people who subscribed to al Qaeda's ideology were indicted on terrorism-related charges in the United States, confirming the trend of the past four years, which is a sharp decline in such cases that has been documented by the authors in previous pieces for CNN.com.\n\nIt's about time that politicians who are quick to talk about the threat posed by al Qaeda began paying attention to the shifting nature of the threats.\n\nIn comparing the two sources of domestic terrorism, it's striking that the jihadists charged with crimes were much less likely to have actually carried out a violent attack before they were arrested.\n\nAccording to data gathered by the New America Foundation, 207 people motivated by al Qaeda's ideology of violence against American targets have been indicted in the U.S. on terrorism-related charges since 9/11. But only about 5% of those were indicted for their roles in violent incidents, whereas of the 139 right-wing militants indicted in the United States since 9/11, just under half had engaged in a violent attack before they were arrested.\n\nThe word \"terrorism\" is not often used in the charges leveled against these right-wing militants, simply because laws in the United States primarily define terrorism as the work of a designated foreign terrorist group.\n\nBut the New America data shows that domestic terrorists motivated by non-jihadist ideologies now pose a similar or even greater threat than those who admire al Qaeda. We define non-jihadist terrorists to be those who carry out or aspire to carry out acts of politically motivated violence, and who fall into the following categories: right-wing extremists who oppose the government, subscribe to a neo-Nazi ideology, or oppose homosexuality or abortion; left-wing extremists; violent animal rights activists; and violent environmental activists.\n\nOver the past several years, acts or plots of non-jihadist terrorism have derived almost entirely from right-wing extremists like the soldiers' militia in Georgia and the anti-government group in Louisiana. Of the 54 non-jihadist terrorists indicted between 2010 and 2012, 47 were right-wing extremists.\n\nSeven were leftists or animal rights extremists. For instance, three were participants in Occupy Chicago, a leftist political movement, and were indicted on terrorism charges last June for plotting to throw Molotov cocktails at President Barack Obama and other officials during a NATO summit in Chicago. Their lawyers say an undercover government agent had urged them to plot the attacks and build the firebombs.\n\nSince 9/11, at least 29 people living in the United States have been killed by right-wing extremists, while 17 have been killed by jihadist extremists, the majority of whom died in one incident: the 2009 massacre at Fort Hood, Texas. Of course, this story would be much different if al Qaeda recruit Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab had detonated a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard Northwest Flight 253 on Christmas Day 2009.\n\nBut it would also be much different if city workers hadn't spotted a suspicious backpack left on the route of a Martin Luther King Jr. parade in Spokane, Washington, in January 2011, in which white supremacist Kevin Harpham had hidden a bomb packed with fishing weights coated in rat poison. Or if police hadn't discovered a napalm bomb and several other live, wired explosives in the suburban Cleveland home of right-wing extremist Matthew Fairfield in April 2010.\n\nAnd of all the people indicted on terrorism charges in the United States since 9/11, no jihadist suspect has ever acquired or attempted to acquire chemical, biological or radiological weapons, while at least 11 right- and left-wing terrorists either obtained such materials or made serious attempts to do so.\n\nIn 2003, federal agents discovered \"nearly two pounds of a cyanide compound and other chemicals that could create enough poisonous gas to kill everyone inside a space as large as a big-chain bookstore or a small-town civic center\" at the home of Judith Bruey and her husband, William Krar, according to an Associated Press report. Alongside the arsenal of chemical weapons were about 60 pipe bombs, several machine guns, remote-controlled bombs disguised as briefcases, and anti-Semitic, anti-black, and anti-government literature, the report said.\n\nAlthough the feds had been tracking Bruey and Krar in the mid-90s, their case fell through the cracks when the events of 9/11 turned law enforcement's attention to jihadist terrorism. The couple was only found out when Krar tried to mail a package of counterfeit birth certificates to an anti-government militia member in New Jersey, but got the address wrong. That mistake resulted in a tip to local police.\n\nA report from the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point released in January found that, \"In the last few years, and especially since 2007, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of attacks and violent plots originating from people and groups who self-identify with the far-right of American politics.\"\n\nIn a report that was much criticized at the time, the Department of Homeland Security predicted in 2009 that the nation's election the previous year of its first black president, along with a severe economic downturn that created disenchantment with the government among poorer populations, had the potential to radicalize greater numbers of right-wing terrorists. The same report warned that increasing numbers of returning military veterans as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down provided those on the far right with a vulnerable population to target for radicalization.\n\nThe New America Foundation data shows that about 20% of the right-wing extremists indicted since 9/11 had spent time in the military.\n\nThe New America data supports the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of the growing threat of right-wing extremist groups. American politicians and the public should become more aware of the fact that while the threat from al Qaeda-inspired terrorists is much diminished at home, the threat from right-wing militants continues to rise.\n\nDavid Sterman assisted with research for this report.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A federal advisory panel said Friday that Congress should move immediately to cut payments to hospitals for many services that can be provided at much lower cost in doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices.\n\nThe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said the current payment disparities had created incentives for hospitals to buy physician practices, driving up costs for the Medicare program and for beneficiaries. Hospital buyouts of doctors, turning independent practitioners into hospital employees, have also led to higher spending by private insurers and higher co-payments for their policyholders, the commission said.\n\nCongress often adopts ideas suggested by the commission, and hospital executives fear that could happen again as lawmakers search for ways to squeeze savings out of Medicare.\n\nMedicare uses different fee schedules and formulas to pay for services provided in doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices and in hospital clinics.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn many cases, a physician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practice that is purchased by a hospital stays in the same location and treats the same patients,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare and beneficiaries pay more for the same services,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the 17-member commission said in a report to Congress.\n\nFor example, it said, Medicare pays $58 for a 15-minute visit to a doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office and 70 percent more \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $98.70 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for the same consultation in the outpatient department of a hospital. The patient also pays more: $24.68, rather than $14.50.\n\nLikewise, the commission said, when a Medicare beneficiary receives a certain type of echocardiogram in a doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, the government and the patient together pay a total of $188. They pay more than twice as much \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $452 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for the same test in the outpatient department of a hospital. (The test is used to evaluate the functioning of the heart.) The commission urged Congress to \u00e2\u0080\u009cequalize payment rates\u00e2\u0080\u009d or at least reduce the disparities, for doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office visits and hospital clinic visits in which similar patients receive the same or similar services.\n\nVariations in payment \u00e2\u0080\u009curgently need to be addressed because many ambulatory services have been migrating from physicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices to the usually higher-paid outpatient department setting, as hospital employment of physicians has increased,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the panel said.\n\nUnder the changes outlined by the commission, hospital clinics could lose 5 percent of their Medicare revenue. But the Medicare program and beneficiaries could save $1.8 billion a year, the panel said.\n\nHospitals strenuously oppose the cuts, saying they have many costs that doctors practicing on their own do not have.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare already underpays hospitals for caring for patients in an outpatient setting, and the commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals would worsen that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joanna Kim, a vice president of the American Hospital Association. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHospitals might be forced to curtail services, threatening access for the poor and patients with multiple chronic conditions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFull-service hospitals, unlike doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices, have emergency rooms and \u00e2\u0080\u009cstandby capacity\u00e2\u0080\u009d to care for victims of accidents, natural disasters, epidemics and terrorist actions. And hospitals are subject to more stringent regulation.\n\nJonathan D. Blum, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the Obama administration had \u00e2\u0080\u009cno official position\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal. But at a Congressional hearing on Friday, Mr. Blum said he supported the general goal of \u00e2\u0080\u009csite-neutral payments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning that Medicare would pay about the same amount for a service, regardless of where it was provided.\n\nThe new health care law encourages doctors and hospitals to join forces, coordinate care and hold down costs. But the Medicare commission cited another reason for collaboration, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHospitals often choose to employ physicians to ensure a stable stream of tests, admissions and referrals to specialists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom 2010 to 2011, the commission said, the number of echocardiograms provided to Medicare beneficiaries in doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices declined by 6 percent, but the number in hospital outpatient clinics increased by nearly 18 percent.\n\nThe shift reflects \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinancial incentives in Medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s payment systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d and coincides with \u00e2\u0080\u009crapid growth in hospitals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 employment of cardiologists,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the panel said, noting that the share of cardiologists who are employed by hospitals tripled, to 35 percent in 2012, from 11 percent in 2007.\n\nIn a separate section of its report, the panel explored broader changes in Medicare, under which each beneficiary would receive a fixed amount of federal money to buy insurance from a private health plan or to help pay for coverage under the traditional Medicare program.\n\nRepublicans have championed such proposals as a way to increase choices for beneficiaries and save money for Medicare. President Obama and other Democrats have denounced the idea, saying it would turn Medicare into a voucher program and expose beneficiaries to higher costs.\n\nThe nonpartisan Medicare commission said the proposals were not necessarily good or bad but were \u00e2\u0080\u009cworth investigating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe effects on beneficiaries and the potential savings, it said, depend on the answers to crucial questions: whether all plans would offer the same benefits, how the federal contribution would be set, how it would increase over time and whether the traditional Medicare program would compete directly with plans offered by private insurers.",

    "text": "The federal reserve is scrambling to convince the public that it is not a secretive institution that acts at the behest of Wall Street, but the public isn't buying the Fed's line. According to a Gallup Poll conducted in mid-July, the Fed received the lowest approval rating of the nine government agencies and departments evaluated--even lower than the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nTrying to show the softer side of the central bank, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke took us on a tour of his hometown of Dillon, S.C. on a 60 Minutes segment in March, and in July he fielded questions from newsman Jim Lehrer and an auditorium full of people for more than an hour in a televised town hall meeting.\n\nBoth events were carefully choreographed--and unprecedented. During his face time Bernanke explained many things, including the Fed's strategy for shrinking its balance sheet and withdrawing the ocean of excess reserves from the banking system. Unfortunately, he did not address my main beef with the bank: that it clings to a flawed inflation-targeting regime with a horrible history of monetary policy failures.\n\nIn pursuit of inflation targeting--the idea that monetary policy should be geared to keeping the annual core inflation rate in a range of, say, 0% to 2%--the Fed has been much more tolerant of inflation than it has of deflation. In November 2002 then governor Bernanke and then chairman Alan Greenspan misdiagnosed a benign cyclical dip in the price level. Fearing deflation, the Fed panicked, and by July 2003 pushed the Fed funds rate down to a then record low of 1%, where it stayed for a year, allowing a flood of liquidity to hit the economy and the housing bubble to inflate. The Fed ignored economic theory developed by Austrian economists such as Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek, who demonstrated that there was such a thing as a \"good deflation,\" which occurs during a productivity boom. It was just such a boom, coupled with an improvement in the U.S. terms of trade, that was putting downward pressure on the core inflation rate.\n\nMore monetary blundering occurred after the Dubai G7 Summit in September 2003, when the U.S. got other Western nations on board to pressure China to allow its currency to appreciate against the dollar. The 2004 elections were approaching, and the outcome of key contests in the Rust Belt, according to President Bush's advisors, hinged on whether China could be forced to alter its fixed yuan-dollar exchange rate of 8.28. Surprisingly, the Fed was drawn into what is normally the exclusive domain of the U.S. Treasury--the dollar's exchange rate.\n\nThe Bush Administration's weak dollar policy, endorsed by the Fed, brought with it not only a dollar rout but also an explosion in commodity prices. Perhaps the commodity price surge explains why the Fed was behind the curve in lowering the Fed funds rate--something that pushed the economy into a steep recession well before the collapse of Lehman Brothers one year ago. By the start of 2007 weak aggregate demand was signaling a recession, but the Fed kept the funds rate at 5.25% until mid-September 2007. It's not surprising that the economy tanked.\n\nNever mind these missteps. The Obama Administration has proposed rewarding the Fed for its failures by crowning it the nation's systemic regulator--a sort of financial regulatory czar. But many in Congress demand a closer peek inside the central bank.\n\nCongressman Ron Paul (R--Tex.), along with 282 cosponsors, has introduced a bill that would require the Government Accountability Office to audit the Fed. The Fed claims that auditing would imperil its independence.\n\nMilton Friedman weighed in on central bank independence in a 1962 essay, \"Should There Be an Independent Monetary Authority?\" Friedman's conclusion: \"The case against a fully independent central bank is strong indeed.\" As for letting in some sunshine, the late senator Patrick Moynihan (D--N.Y.) had it right: \"Secrecy is for losers.\"\n\nAs we await the outcome of the battle over Fed transparency, we should ponder a recent conclusion of Carnegie Mellon's Allan Meltzer. As the author of the authoritative A History of the Federal Reserve, he has observed that the Fed responds \"decisively to the unemployment rate but not to the inflation rate.\" As long as unemployment remains elevated, expect loose monetary reins and more inflation.\n\nProtect yourself with some exchange-traded funds.

The seller was Mark Gainor, founder of the health-care and financial services company Lucor Holdings. Mr. Gainor was represented by Nelson Gonzalez of EWM Realty International, an affiliate of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. Mr. Collins was represented by Mathieu Rochette of Barclay\u2019s Real Estate Group.\n\nMr. Collins also has a home in New York, but has two sons in Florida so he spends a lot of time in Miami, according to Mr. Rochette.\n\nThe seven-bedroom house has about 200 feet of waterfront on Biscayne Bay and a view of the Miami skyline, Mr. Gonzalez said. Mr. Gainor purchased the house from Ms. Lopez in 2005 for $13.9 million. He said he spent about three years gut-renovating it and lived there for about seven years, but decided to sell because he is moving to the West Coast.\n\nThe Mediterranean-style home, built in the late 1920s, measures about 12,100 square feet and sits on over an acre. In renovating the home, Mr. Gainor said he tried to keep \u201ca lot of the same look and feel from its original state\u201d in the exterior, but the interiors are European contemporary in style.\n\nThe renovation involved removing the roof and reconfiguring all of the rooms on the second floor, creating a massive master suite with a closet that measures about 1,000 square feet. The house has an elevator and an interior courtyard with a 6,000-gallon koi pond. There\u2019s a 60-foot long swimming pool and spa tub, a coral stone deck, and a cabana with an outdoor kitchen. The property has a dock with room for several boats.\n\nMr. Gainor said the home likely appeals to celebrities because it\u2019s \u201cvery private\u201d\u2014in renovating the property, he did extensive landscaping \u201cso nobody could see us on either side.\u201d\n\nPrivacy was in fact one reason Mr. Collins was attracted to the property, Mr. Rochette said, along with the size of the lot and the views. \u201cHe was really looking for a big piece of land,\u201d Mr. Rochette said. Mr. Collins declined to comment.\n\nHaving more than an acre is considered a \u201cvery large lot for Miami Beach,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said.\n\nThe home had been on an off the market for several years. It initially came on the market in 2010 for $29 million, but was most recently listed for $37.5 million. \u201cWe took our time selling it, looking for the right price and the right buyer,\u201d said Mr. Gainor.\n\nHe said he believes he\u2019s found it in Mr. Collins, noting that he is a fan of his music. \u201cHe\u2019ll enjoy it,\u201d Mr. Gainor said.\n\nMr. Gonzalez said he\u2019s seen an uptick in recent activity at the very high end of the market in Miami. \u201cInventory is really drying up,\u201d he said, noting that he\u2019s sold two other homes in the $30 million range in the past year: 12 Indian Creek sold for $28 million, and 17 Indian Creek for $30 million.",

Bobby Jindal against becoming \u201cthe party of austerity.\u201d Just as GOP lawmakers are tacitly endorsing sequester cuts to the Pentagon, long a sacred cow, they fear the balanced-budget goal will force them to abandon a campaign pledge not to reduce Medicare benefits for those who are now 55 and older.\n\n\u201cI know a number of people who have real concerns about where this is going,\u201d said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), who said Medicare cuts targeting people as old as 58 are under discussion.\n\n\u201cOne of the last presidents to balance the budget was Herbert Hoover,\u201d King added darkly, referring to the penny-pinching Republican blamed for deepening the Great Depression.\n\nGOP leaders say the strategy has been necessary to persuade their right wing to postpone a fight over the debt ceiling until this summer and to support a bill on the floor this week to fund the government through the end of September. The payoff, they say, will be a budget framework that holds the promise of paying down the national debt without higher taxes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of political peril associated with this. Whether we as a conference have the stomach to look at Medicare and Social Security spending will be the make-or-break part of the deal,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior member of the House Budget Committee. \u201cBut I think setting an ambitious goal was wise. If we can\u2019t do it, the country can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nBudget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) plans to present the new framework next week and put it to a vote in the House before the Easter break. In a brief interview, he said the year-end \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d deal made balancing the budget easier than it would have been last year, when he offered a plan that wouldn\u2019t balance the budget until nearly 2040. Independent analysts estimate that Ryan would have to cut about $100 billion more in 2023 to balance spending and revenue.\n\n\u201cMy first reaction [to the balanced-budget pledge] was the same as everybody else\u2019s: God, what . . . is he going to do?

Just as the pain of the sequester starts affecting schools, parks and airports, Democrats say, Republicans will be promoting a vision of extreme austerity that voters rejected in the 2012 presidential campaign \u2014 which featured Ryan as the GOP vice-presidential nominee.",

These equations, the app\u2019s Background section explains, have helped shape nearly every training program since developed for runners.\n\nThe app is available in two versions: one for $0.99 [iTunes link], and a second for free [iTunes link], courtesy of New Balance. The paid version is ad-free and allows users to e-mail and print their training plans, as well as receive special discounts and other offers.\n\nWhile the app offers a much more convenient alternative to planning my own training guide (which I\u2019ve somewhat inefficiently been doing in iCal for the past two years), it doesn\u2019t offer enough functionality to be truly useful.

At the time he was selected, Spikes was represented by Marietta, Georgia-based football agent Terry Watson of Watson Sports Agency. A year later, Spikes left Watson to sign with competitor Drew Rosenhaus of Rosenhaus Sports Representation after rumors circulated that Spikes had made wild monetary demands to Watson.\n\nA mugshot of football agent Terry Watson. Photo courtesy of @DerekMedlin.\n\nIn the past 2 years, Watson has felt the burn of clients leaving his firm for his rivals. Kansas City Chiefs defensive end Allen Bailey (No. 86 overall pick of the 2011 NFL Draft) also moved from Watson to Rosenhaus after being selected. in 2012, Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Mike Harris decided to switch from Watson to Joe Linta and Tom Kleine of JL Sports agency. Earlier this year, San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver changed agencies, going from Watson\u2019s company to Joel Segal of Lagardere Unlimited.\n\nYet, Watson\u2019s biggest problem is not the fact that his once-reputable client base has gradually drifted away and into his competitors hands. Instead, his focus is on the State of North Carolina, where he currently faces 14 felony counts (based on Athlete Agent Inducement & Felony Obstruction of Justice) on charges that he violated the State\u2019s laws concerning athlete agents. Watson has been indicted for allegedly providing a host of illegal benefits to former football players at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, all of whom now play in the NFL.\n\nThe alleged benefits come in the form of money, hotel rooms and airfare, and were purportedly provided by Watson to Marvin Austin, Greg Little and Robert Quinn.\n\nAs early as September 2010, it was known that Austin, Little and Quinn were being investigated for allegedly receiving benefits deemed to be improper by the NCAA. Those players have had a tough time keeping their names out of the news. Each of the aforementioned football players have changed agents since entering the NFL. One agent even sued Quinn (for agent commissions on his first NFL contract) and Austin (for recruiting Quinn away to a rival agent). In 2011, an NCAA Notice of Allegations against the University of North Carolina mentioned that Austin and Little received money to cover travel expenses (in violation of NCAA rules and regulations).\n\nThe indictments against Watson reveal that Watson allegedly attempted to induce Little and Austin to sign an agency contract with him and paid the two players money throughout 2010. Additionally, the indictments show that Watson provided Little and Quinn with hotel rooms and airline tickets on multiple occasions.\n\nThe alleged benefits received by the former UNC football players may have begun as early as May 4, 2010. It was only 2 months later that Joe Schad of ESPN.com learned that the NCAA had initiated an investigation of UNC\u2019s football program concerning benefits that may have been delivered from sports agents to student-athletes. Marvin Austin was 1 of 13 players who were interviewed as part of the investigation. The State of North Carolina got into a legal battle with the NCAA over a request for the documents and records related to the NCAA investigation. And then the State embarked on its own investigation. Now it seems that Terry Watson may be hit with some major penalties in a rare display of a state actually enforcing the athlete agent laws it has on the books.\n\nEarlier today, Watson was released on a $50,000 bond. His next court appearance is scheduled for October 15.\n\nDarren Heitner is a Partner at Wolfe Law Miami, P.A. in Miami, Florida, Founder of Sports Agent Blog, and Professor of Sport Agency Management at Indiana University.

Evidence of willful obstruction could raise the stakes for Volkswagen amid criminal investigations into the diesel scandal by U.S. authorities.\n\nKlaus Ziehe, the prosecutor in Braunschweig who is leading several investigations of Volkswagen employees in connection with the emissions scandal, said the employee \u201cmade suggestions to other employees in a roundabout way that they should delete or at least remove files linked to the diesel issue.\u201d\n\nVolkswagen employees transferred much of the data to thumb drives, most of which were later recovered.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think a lot of data were lost that could significantly impede or delay the investigation,\u201d Mr. Ziehe said.\n\nIn a separate case in March, a former Volkswagen employee filed a lawsuit in Michigan alleging that his co-workers continued to delete files at a Volkswagen data center in Auburn Hills, Mich., even after September, when the company issued a \u201clitigation hold\u201d requiring employees to preserve all files as potential evidence in the investigation.\n\nThe whistleblower, Daniel Donovan, alleges that he was fired because his superiors believed he was going to report the company to authorities, according to a court filing seen by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nA Volkswagen spokesman has said that Mr. Donovan was let go for other reasons, but declined to elaborate because of privacy laws.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear if there is any link between the case under investigation by Braunschweig and Mr. Donovan\u2019s allegations in the U.S.\n\nThe investigation of the German manager was first reported by German media.\n\nU.S. authorities disclosed in September that Volkswagen had manipulated software in some of its diesel vehicles to produce lower levels of toxic nitrogen oxide emissions during laboratory tests than under real driving conditions.\n\nProsecutors in Braunschweig, the district with jurisdiction over Wolfsburg, where Volkswagen is based, have said they are investigating around 17 people in connection with the emissions scandal. No charges have been filed against anyone yet.\n\nA Volkswagen official, who asked to remain anonymous because of the ongoing investigation, said the person under investigation is a member of the legal team and has been suspended pending completion of the investigation.\n\nOlaf Lies, economics minister in Lower Saxony state, a major Volkswagen shareholder, said the company\u2019s supervisory board had also discussed the allegations that employees removed or destroyed evidence.\n\n\u201cWe are taking these allegations very seriously,\u201d he told the state\u2019s legislature on Thursday.\n\nWrite to William Boston at william.boston@wsj.com",

    "text": "BOSTON, April 3\u2014 Left-handed people tend to live significantly shorter lives than right-handers, perhaps because they face more perils in a world dominated by the right-handed, according to new research.\n\nEarlier studies also suggested that left-handed people do not seem to live as long as those right-handed.\n\nIn a letter in the current issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers who studied the deaths of 1,000 Southern Californians report that right-handers, on average, live to be 75 years old. Left-handers typically die at age 66.\n\nThe trend was seen in both men and women. Right-handed women tended to live five years longer than left-handed women. Right-handed men lived 10 years longer than left-handed men, the report said.\n\nThe researchers, Dr. Diane F. Halpern of California State University at San Bernardino and Dr. Stanley Coren of the University of British Columbia, said the differences were striking.\n\nThey cautioned, \"We are not implying that using one's left hand causes a risk of earlier death.\" But they found that left-handers were more than five times (7.9 percent to 1.5 percent) as likely to die in accidents, often while driving. One reason, they suggested, is that left-handers live in a world designed for right-handers.\n\nTheir findings support a 1989 study published in The American Journal of Public Health that found a higher rate of accident-related injuries in left-handed people.\n\nDr. Halpern and Dr. Coren also speculated that left-handers might fall victim to underlying neurological or immune-system problems that have been shown to be slightly more common in left-handers.\n\nAn earlier study of baseball players showed that from the time statistics were kept, the mean life span of left-handers was nine months shorter than that of right-handers. The proportion of left-handers is 13 percent among people in their 20's, but only 1 percent among those in their 80's.\n\nAnother researcher at the University of British Columbia who was involved in the earlier study, Dr. Stanley Coren, said, \"Nine months in a lifetime does not sound like much, but it is a very large difference in statistics involving a large group of people.\"",

    "text": "Lester Bernstein, a former editor of Newsweek magazine who also wrote for The New York Times, was a foreign correspondent for Time magazine and, as a vice president of NBC in 1960, helped arrange America\u2019s first televised presidential debates, died on Thursday at his home in Lido Beach, N.Y. He was 94.\n\nHis death was announced by his daughter Nina Bernstein, a reporter for The Times. It came eight days after his wife, Mimi, died, and 71 years to the day after they met at a U.S.O. dance in Austin, Tex.\n\nIn a half-century career, Mr. Bernstein was a theater columnist for The Times; a Rome and London correspondent for Time; a senior Newsweek editor in the 1960s and \u201970s, and then its chief editor from 1979 to 1982, when the magazine won national awards for general excellence and in-depth reporting.\n\nIn August 1960, Mr. Bernstein, representing the NBC television network, worked with executives of CBS and ABC and aides to Senator John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard M. Nixon, the Democratic and Republican nominees, to hammer out logistical details of the nation\u2019s first televised presidential debates.\n\nThe four live presidential debates that fall drew national audiences of up to 70 million people and were widely regarded as a major factor in Kennedy\u2019s narrow election victory.\n\nWhile he began and ended his career writing for The Times, Mr. Bernstein was known primarily for his work at Time and Newsweek in an era when newsmagazines were read in millions of homes, barbershops and doctors\u2019 offices for their terse, often anonymously written weekly digests of international and national news and reports on science, culture and other topics.\n\nAs a senior editor at Newsweek in the 1960s, he supervised coverage of wars, disasters, elections and other world and national news. He decided what to cover, which reporters to deploy and the emphasis and play of articles. He also traveled widely to oversee staff work, especially in political campaigns, and was sometimes on the scene of breaking news.\n\nIn June 1968, he accompanied Senator Robert F. Kennedy to Los Angeles when he won the California primary in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and was at the Ambassador Hotel on the night the senator was assassinated.\n\nMr. Bernstein gained a reputation for stylish writing covering Broadway as a reporter and columnist for The Times in the 1940s, interviewing stars like Ingrid Bergman. He joined Time in 1948 as a film critic and in 1952 was posted to Rome, where he interviewed Gina Lollobrigida and luminaries of Italian postwar neorealism cinema like Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica.\n\nIn 1955, he became Time\u2019s London correspondent, covering Britain and Europe. He interviewed Carl Jung for a cover story on psychiatry, and profiled the Rev. Billy Graham on a European revival tour. In 1956, he returned to New York as an associate editor and writer and wrote a cover profile of Edward R. Murrow, the wartime CBS broadcaster, evoking \u201can apocalyptic voice and a cachet as plain as his inevitable cigarette.\u201d\n\nAfter four years at NBC, Mr. Bernstein joined Newsweek as national affairs editor in 1963 and was soon directing coverage of President Kennedy\u2019s assassination. He became executive editor in 1965 and managing editor in 1969. After long lagging behind Time in circulation and advertising, Newsweek gained on its rival in the 1960s with more ambitious coverage of civil rights, the women\u2019s movement and the Vietnam War.\n\nIn 1972, when Osborn Elliott succeeded Kermit I. Lansner as editor, Mr. Bernstein felt passed over and moved to RCA as a vice president, writing speeches for Robert W. Sarnoff, the chairman.\n\nIn 1979, after a series of leadership changes at Newsweek during Mr. Bernstein\u2019s absence, Katharine Graham, chairman of The Washington Post Company, Newsweek\u2019s owner, brought Mr. Bernstein back as the top editor.\n\nThe magazine won several honors on his watch. In 1981, the American Society of Magazine Editors cited Newsweek as a finalist for awards in reporting and criticism. A year later the group gave the magazine its top national awards for general excellence and for a whole issue devoted to one topic: \u201cWhat Vietnam Did to Us.\u201d\n\nMr. Bernstein was replaced in 1982 by William D. Broyles Jr., former editor of Texas Monthly.\n\n\u201cWe are all extremely grateful to Lester Bernstein for returning to Newsweek to build a sound foundation for future growth,\u201d Mrs. Graham said at the time. \u201cThe record number of awards received by the magazine last year, and already equaled this year, is only one measure of his outstanding success.\u201d\n\nLester Bernstein was born in the Bronx on July 18, 1920, to Isidore and Rebecca Axelrod Bernstein, Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Eastern Europe. He graduated in 1936 from DeWitt Clinton High School and in 1940 from Columbia College, where he was The Times campus correspondent.\n\nHe soon joined the paper\u2019s staff. On Dec. 7, 1941, writing bulletins for The Times\u2019s radio affiliate, he was the first staff member to report the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He was an Army radioman in Europe in World War II, then rejoined the paper as a theater reporter.\n\nIn 1946, he married Jacqueline Lipscomb, an artist who exhibited under the name Mimi Talbot.\n\nBesides his daughter Nina, he is survived by another daughter, Lynn Brenner; a son, Paul; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. Another son, Daniel, died in 1978.\n\nAt Newsweek, Mr. Bernstein and other top editors became known as the Flying Wallendas for managing tasks on deadline with the seeming ease of the famed trapeze artists. In a tribute, staff members framed a circus poster of the high-wire troupe and hung it in his office.\n\nHe was a courtly raconteur who relished stories of events in the news, elections won and lost and the people he had known. He also loved sailing, which he took up in his 50s, and owned a 40-foot ketch that he piloted in coastal waters from Maryland to Maine, where he had a summer home.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still the most civilized man I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d Peter Goldman, a former Newsweek writer, said after a 2012 reunion lunch marking Mr. Bernstein\u2019s 92nd birthday.\n\nMr. Bernstein wrote for The Times in the late 1980s: book reviews, Op-Ed commentaries, travel and leisure essays and a 5,000-word magazine piece on the expansionist empire bequeathed by Henry R. Luce, who founded Time, Life, Fortune and other publications.\n\n\u201cToday Time Inc., tomorrow the world,\u201d he wrote in a parody of Time\u2019s pithy, aggressive, backward-ran-the-sentences style. \u201cIt is a powerful vision, if not quite the legacy of Henry Luce. It conjures up the once-celebrated kicker of Wolcott Gibbs\u2019s 1936 New Yorker profile of Luce: \u2018Where it will all end, knows God!' \u201d",

Amy Derrick Frost told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"Anyone who threatens to disrupt freedom of navigation in an international strait is clearly outside the community of nations; any disruption will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe 34-mile-wide shipping channel leads in and out of the Persian Gulf between Iran and Oman. It is strategically important because tankers carrying oil travel through it.\n\nIran's vice president has warned that the country could block the strait if sanctions are imposed on its exports of crude oil. France, Britain and Germany have proposed sanctions to punish Iran's lack of cooperation on its nuclear program.\n\nPhysically closing the strait would require means that likely are not available to Iran, said Professor Jean-Paul Rodrigue of Hofstra University.\n\n\"At best, Iran can posture and potentially disrupt traffic for a short duration,\" said Rodrigue, who specializes in global trade and maritime transportation issues.\n\nThe 5th Fleet is based in Bahrain, and Frost noted that the Navy \"maintains a robust presence in the region to deter or counter destabilizing activities.\"\n\n\"We conduct maritime security operations under international maritime conventions to ensure security and safety in international waters for all commercial shipping to operate freely while transiting the region,\" she said.\n\nAsked whether the fleet would be able to keep the strait open if Iran moved to close it, she said, \"The U.S. Navy is a flexible, multi-capable force committed to regional security and stability, always ready to counter malevolent actions to ensure freedom of navigation.\"\n\nFrost was also asked whether keeping the strait open is part of the fleet's mandate.\n\nShe said it is \"committed to protecting maritime freedoms that are the basis for global prosperity. This is one of the main reasons our military forces operate in the region.\n\n\"The U.S. Navy, along with our coalition and regional partners, operates under international maritime conventions to maintain a constant state of high vigilance in order to ensure the continued, safe flow of maritime traffic in waterways critical to global commerce.\"\n\nThe French Foreign Ministry stressed that the waterway is an international strait.\n\n\"In consequence, all ships, whatever their flag, enjoy the right of passage in transit, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, adopted in 1982, and with the customary international maritime law,\" the ministry said.\n\nIran is holding a 10-day military exercise in an area from the eastern part of the strait out into the Arabian Sea. Western diplomats describe the maneuvers as further evidence of Iran's volatile behavior.\n\nRodrigue told CNN that any move by Iran to close the strait would be \"suicidal\" to the current regime.\n\nIn 2009, 15 million barrels passed through the strait every day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n\"Keep in mind that countries such as China and Japan are more dependent on Persian Gulf oil than the United States,\" the professor said.\n\nAbout 18% of U.S. net petroleum imports come from the Persian Gulf region, while Canada provides 25%, according to Rodrigue.\n\nThe scholar, who has written extensively about oil \"chokepoints,\" said there are no other means to move large quantities of oil over long distance than by maritime transportation.\n\nHormuz marks the boundary between Iran and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"It is thus an international issue where the United States, for strategic and historical reasons, is spearheading its security,\" Rodrigue said.\n\nBarbara Starr is CNN Pentagon correspondent.",

    "text": "It is not just habit. All of Karanka\u2019s peers in the Premier League go into this much detail, too. Survival in England\u2019s top flight is more than a battle of wits, or even money; it is a war of information. Losing is, often, not simply about playing worse; it is about knowing less. As Karanka sees it, his job is to make sure his players know \u201cat least 95 percent\u201d of what they will need to discern even before they step on the field.\n\nThat is why his staff prepares a new ledger for him before every game. Middlesbrough\u2019s visit to Manchester United on Saturday might have the veneer of a special occasion, given that Karanka, 43, will be having a reunion with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, whom he served as an assistant at Real Madrid, who showed him the ropes of management and to whom he says he will \u201calways say thank you.\u201d But Karanka, determined to show his former boss just how much he has learned, will prepare for the game just the same as he would for any other. There will be a hundred pages to study, thousands of things to consider and contemplate and counter.\n\nOne day last month, Karanka offered rare and detailed insight into all of the unseen work that he and his managerial peers put into every game of the Premier League season. Leafing through the report for his opponent that weekend \u2014 another of England\u2019s giants, Chelsea \u2014 he outlined the process by which he prepares his players, describing how many arduous hours are spent in the shadows getting ready for those 90 lightning minutes every Saturday.\n\n\u201cA normal week, when we have played on Saturday, we have Sunday to recover and then Monday is a day off,\u201d he said, beginning to flick through the pages. \u201cSunday and Monday, the analysts work to tell me everything about our next opponents.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday morning, the staff has a meeting: me, the analyst, the fitness and goalkeeping coaches, my assistants. First, we analyze our last game: how well we played, or how badly, the mistakes we made. Then the analyst gives his general thoughts on our opponents.\n\n\u201cFrom those thoughts, he will provide images and videos and reports, and from those we create the exercises for the training ground.\u201d\n\nHe opens the report. It starts with the Premier League standings and goes through the shapes deployed by Chelsea in recent weeks. It lists a possible lineup that Karanka might pick, but also a handful of alternatives. It goes into an analysis of defensive shape, then a description of attacking style. There is an emphasis on set pieces. Karanka would, presumably, go along with Pep Guardiola\u2019s assertion that these are a uniquely defining characteristic of games in England. Each opposition player is also analyzed, his strengths, weaknesses, anything in particular that needs to be attacked \u2014 or defended against.\n\nKaranka and his coaches then plot out training exercises with all that in mind, what Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager, refers to as the \u201ckinesthetic\u201d approach to learning.\n\n\u201cThe best way to show the players is in training,\u201d Karanka said. \u201cThey are doing it, but they don\u2019t notice they are doing it.\n\n\u201cThen when you show them the video, and say we have to play this way, because they will have problems if we do that, they will say, \u2018Oh, we just have to do what we have been doing in training.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat video session with the team will occur toward the end of the week, once the lessons have been burned into brains. But before then, usually on a Thursday, Karanka will hand his players personalized reports on their direct opponents. \u201cOur central defenders will see the opposition\u2019s strikers, our fullbacks their wingers, our wingers their fullbacks,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are individual video sessions, too, for players eager for insight into what they could be doing better. One, Adama Traor\u00e9, 20, is on what Karanka calls an intensive process of learning where he can improve his game.\n\n\u201cOne afternoon a week, Adama comes in to watch his clips,\u201d Karanka said. \u201cThere are videos of games, of training sessions. We ask him questions, correct certain things. The analysts look at every movement he makes, the fitness coaches every detail of his output.\u201d\n\nOther players come in on a more ad hoc basis. \u201cPlayers will come and ask to watch clips, and we will show them certain training sessions,\u201d Karanka said. \u201cIn the past, when I was a player, the manager could say you made a mistake and you could deny it. Now: Here is the mistake, watch it.\u201d\n\nThat empirical side of his job is important to Karanka. The two projects that currently concern Mark Ellis, Middlesbrough\u2019s chief operating officer, are an expansion of the parking lot at the training center \u2014 one cost of the enlarged Premier League squad required after Middlesbrough won promotion last season \u2014 and Karanka\u2019s request to install elevated cameras over the training fields, the better to analyze his squad\u2019s sessions.\n\n\u201cThe more information, the better for everyone,\u201d he said. It is a belief given root by his own playing career, with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. The most difficult moments, he said, came when managers told him what they thought he wanted to hear, rather than the truth.\n\nHe was \u201con that sofa\u201d too often asking why he was not playing to contemplate misleading his own players, he said. It is the same reason he refuses to criticize a player in front of his teammates, preferring instead to highlight regular shortcomings in the privacy of the video room, and armed with evidence. \u201cI show him alone,\u201d he said.\n\nHis obsessive attention to detail does not always bear fruit, of course.\n\n\u201cAgainst Crystal Palace, we conceded a goal from a Wilfried Zaha cross to Christian Benteke,\u201d Karanka said. \u201cWe had seen the image three times in the video. We said don\u2019t let them deliver crosses, and we said if they do, watch Benteke. They scored.\u201d\n\nThe most frustrating goals to concede, he said, are when his players \u201cknow, and it happens anyway.\u201d\n\nThe times when the preparation works, though, are cause for satisfaction, when the week\u2019s exercises and the video sessions and the final team talks on Friday and Saturday are all heeded. A draw at Arsenal earlier this season was one such example.\n\n\u201cAdama played,\u201d he said. \u201cWe trained all week how we could defend without him, so we could have him ready for counterattacks. We showed him where Arsenal would have one fullback, and the other, and where to attack. The players realized that was what we had been working on all week.\u201d\n\nIt almost worked: Traor\u00e9 had two glorious chances to claim an unlikely win for Middlesbrough. Even in the absence of victory, though, Karanka had vindication. All the hours of video, all the pages of the report, all the meticulously sculpted training sessions had been worth it; a long week well spent.\n\nForty-eight hours later, he opened the next report.",

    "text": "A data program used by the campaign of the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, was \u201caccessed\u201d as a part of hack on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) that intelligence officials believe was carried out by Russia\u2019s intelligence services, Clinton\u2019s campaign said on Friday.\n\nThe news came as a new Reuters-Ipsos poll, released after Clinton\u2019s acceptance of the Democratic nomination for president at the party\u2019s convention in Philadelphia, put her six points ahead of her Republican rival, Donald Trump.\n\nHacks against the Democratic party, revealed in the past week, have been blamed on Russian intelligence services. The Clinton campaign has accused the Trump campaign of involvement.\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill said that despite the breach of the campaign network, \u201cno evidence\u201d had been found to suggest that the \u201cinternal systems have been compromised\u201d. Reuters, citing people familiar with the matter, first reported that the Clinton computer network had been hacked.\n\nIn a statement, Merrill said: \u201cAn analytics data program maintained by the DNC, and used by our campaign and a number of other entities, was accessed as part of the DNC hack.\n\n\u201cOur campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised.\u201d\n\nThe FBI said it \u201ctakes seriously any allegations of intrusions\u201d and is \u201caware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these matters\u201d.\n\nThe Trump campaign has denied claims of involvement in the hacks. On Friday, senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in a statement: \u201cThis seems to be a problem wherever Hillary Clinton goes. Hopefully this time there wasn\u2019t classified or top secret information that puts American lives at risk.\u201d\n\nRussian hackers, designated Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear by cybersecurity analysts, broke into the Democratic National Committee at the beginning of last year and are believed to be the source of anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks\u2019 release of 20,000 emails last week, though the group has denied this.\n\nLast Sunday, that leak led to the resignation of the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, on the eve of the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia.\n\nThe emails revealed exchanges between party officials discussing ways to undermine Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, and were seized upon by Sanders supporters who had long called for Wasserman Schultz\u2019s resignation, charging the DNC with tipping the scales in Clinton\u2019s favor.\n\nThe breach of the DNC is believed by security researchers in private industry and the US government to have been the work of Russian intelligence services.\n\nThis week the fundraising network of the the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) was also breached, an act Reuters said US intelligence officials had attributed to Russians as well.\n\nThe US Department of Justice\u2019s national security division is investigating whether hacking attacks on Democratic political organizations threatened US security, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe involvement of the justice department\u2019s national security division was a sign that the Obama administration has concluded that the hacking was state-sponsored, individuals with knowledge of the investigation said.\n\nEarlier, the Clinton campaign, based in Brooklyn, referred to a comment from earlier this week by campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan, criticizing Trump and calling the hacking \u201ca national security issue\u201d.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign has said that the Russians hacked the DNC emails and released them to sow discord in the party and, ultimately, help Trump. The Trump campaign has denied this. Trump himself said a controversial call on Wednesday for Russia to find and release 30,000 \u201cmissing\u201d emails from Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state was \u201csarcastic\u201d.\n\nAmongst the fallout from the scandal and the Democratic convention, the Reuters-Ipsos poll released on Friday showed nearly 41% of likely voters favoring Clinton, 35% favoring Trump, and 25% picking \u201cother\u201d. The poll had a credibility interval of four percentage points.\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Justice had no comment about the reported hack of the Clinton campaign. It was not immediately clear what if any information on the campaign\u2019s computer system hackers might have been able to access.\n\nIn the DCCC breach, hackers gained access to the entire network, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, detailing the extent of the breach for the first time. Access to the full network would have given access to everything from emails to strategy memos and opposition research prepared to support Democratic candidates in campaigns for the House.\n\nThe hack of the DCCC, which is based in Washington, was reported first by Reuters on Thursday, ahead of Clinton\u2019s convention speech in Philadelphia. Russian officials could not be immediately reached for comment. The DCCC said in a statement early on Friday that it has hired the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to investigate.\n\n\u201cWe have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network,\u201d the DCCC said. \u201cWe are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation.\u201d",

    "text": "SAO PAULO, Aug 14 (Reuters) - More defendants are negotiating and signing plea bargain deals in a massive bribery case focused on Brazil's state-run oil firm Petrobras as federal prosecutors prepare charges against higher-profile suspects, including politicians.\n\nPetrobras' former head of corporate services Renato Duque and Fernando Soares, a lobbyist who helped firms win drillship contracts with Petrobras and is accused of funneling bribes to the Brazil Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), are among those negotiating deals, lawyers for both defendants said.\n\nMore than 100 people have been indicted, the country's most powerful engineering executives detained and dozens of lawmakers implicated in the case with prosecutors relying heavily on plea bargain deals, a relatively new legal tool in Brazil, to expand their investigation.\n\nThe push to keep building a stronger list of potential witnesses signals that prosecutors have their eye on even higher-level suspects in the price fixing and political kickback scheme.\n\n\"Prosecutors are both building a case against people higher up the political food chain, and seeking to increase the likelihood that those executives already implicated will receive definitive jail sentences,\" said Matthew Taylor, an expert on Brazil's legal system at American University.\n\nPresident Dilma Rousseff is not being investigated and has supported the probe, but it has ensnared senior members of her Workers' Party and its allies. Combined with a weak economy, it has also pushed her approval ratings down into single digits.\n\nShe served as chairwoman of the board of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, from 2003 to 2010 when much of the alleged graft took place.\n\nProsecutors are expected to present charges against dozens of lawmakers and former ministers they have been investigating since March in coming weeks.\n\nTo be sure, some defendants say they are innocent and will not collaborate, vowing to appeal any eventual sentences.\n\nBrazil's largest engineering firm, Odebrecht SA, denied there were any talks about a deal for CEO Marcelo Odebrecht after the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper said the company was considering cooperation.\n\nMarcelo Odebrecht's personal ties to former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva threaten to bring the scandal closer to the Workers' Party if he were to collaborate.\n\nProsecutors have also opened a separate inquiry into whether Lula improperly used his connections to benefit Odebrecht after leaving office.\n\nDeals with 28 defendants had been sealed as of this week, though only 21 names are public, a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutors' office said, adding that the number is rising daily. Prosecutors do not comment on plea negotiations.\n\nThe rising number of agreements is also a sign the tide is turning against the defendants, lawyers said.\n\nNeither Soares nor Duque managed to get a higher court to order their pre-trial release.\n\nThe Supreme Court has recently upheld other decisions from federal judge Sergio Moro, who oversees the investigation and has become a folk hero for many Brazilians fed up with near daily revelations of corruption.\n\nIn one significant ruling, the high court agreed to transfer Jose Dirceu, who was Lula's chief of staff, to the southern city of Curitiba, where Moro's court is based, on Aug. 3.\n\n\"There are a series of elements that made the outlook a little leas certain for these people,\" Pierpaolo Bottini, who negotiated a plea deal for the chief executive officer of builder Camargo Correa, said of the more recent deals.\n\nBottini's client, Dalton Avancini, told prosecutors that construction executives discussed paying bribes to executives of state-run electrical utility Eletrobras, helping them discover the scandal extended to the power sector and included fraud on contracts to build the Angra 3 power plant and the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam.\n\nAvancini's cooperation reduced his penalty to a six-year house arrest from a potential 16-year prison sentence.\n\nThe CEO of another builder, OAS, who resisted a deal with prosecutors, was sentenced to 16 years in prison last week. The difference in sentences for executives who collaborate and those who do not is also likely encouraging more plea bargains.\n\nA Curitiba-based lawyer not acting in the case, Ubirajara Costodio Filho, said new testimony would likely yield information about politicians since much is already known about the engineering firms that participated in what prosecutors call a cartel that fixed prices on contracts and passed on bribes to executives, political parties and politicians.\n\nBottini said the new plea deals show the tool is becoming more effective. They are common in the United States, but Brazil only passed a law regulating how they should be used in 2012.\n\nIn response to news reports that the former head of Petrobras' international division, Nestor Cervero, sought a plea deal, his lawyer Edson Ribeiro said there would be none as long as he represented Cervero.\n\n\"I do not accept the use of pre-trial detention as a method for obtaining testimony and will not lend my credibility to a judge who violates procedural and constitutional norms, violating the democratic rule of law,\" Ribeiro said.\n\nJudge Moro and the prosecutors say the detentions are legal and that many of the plea deals were signed while defendants were free.\n\n(Reporting by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Christian Plumb and Kieran Murray)",

    "text": "The striking thing about Russia\u2019s subjugation of uppity Georgia was not the ease or audacity but the swagger of it. This was not just about a couple of obscure border enclaves, nor even, really, about Georgia. This was existential payback.\n\nIt turns out that if 1989 was an end \u2014 the end of the Wall, the beginning of the end of the Soviet empire, if not in fact the end of history \u2014 it was also a beginning.\n\nIt gave birth to a bitter resentment in the humiliated soul of Russia, and no one nursed the grudge so fiercely as Vladimir V. Putin. He watched the empire he had spied for disbanded. He endured the belittling lectures of a rich and self-righteous West. He watched the United States charm away his neighbors, invade his allies in Iraq, and, in his view, play God with the political map of Europe.\n\nMr. Putin is, in this sense of grievance, a man of his people, as visitors to the New York Times Web site can see in the sampling of breast-beating commentary from Russian bloggers. It is safe to assume that Mr. Putin\u2019s already stratospheric popularity at home has grown to Phelpsian proportions, not least among the long-suffering military.\n\nIn China, 1989 was the year that a spark of liberal aspiration flickered on Tiananmen Square, and was decisively extinguished. That was another beginning, or at least a renewal: of Chinese resolve. In May of that year, in the midst of the Tiananmen euphoria, Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Beijing, and two visions of a new communism stared each other in the face.\n\nThe protesters on the Chinese pavilion held banners welcoming Mr. Gorbachev as a champion of the greater freedom they sought. Meanwhile, the visiting Russian delegation marveled at the abundance in Chinese stores, the bounty of a policy that chose economic liberalization without political dissent.\n\nThe Chinese and Russians scorned each other\u2019s neo-Communist models, but in some ways they have evolved toward one another. Both countries now tolerate a measure of entrepreneurship and social license, as long as neither threatens the dominion of the state. Both countries have calculated that you can buy a measure of domestic stability if you combine a little opportunity with an appeal to national pride. (The Chinese \u201cstreet\u201d felt no more sympathy for restive Tibetans than the Russian blogosphere felt for Georgia.) And both have discovered that if you are rich the world is less likely to get in your way.\n\nPresident Bush was mocked from both sides for his seeming impotence. Neoconservatives were appalled by photos of President Bush sharing a laugh with Mr. Putin in Beijing while Russian armor gathered at the Georgian border. For a president who has made the export of democracy his signature doctrine, that looked to the stand-tough crowd like a \u201cPet Goat\u201d moment.\n\nOthers argued that this was a crisis Mr. Bush tacitly encouraged by talking up Georgia\u2019s rambunctious president as a friend and NATO candidate. By midweek, possibly goaded by the wailing of neoconservatives and the aggressively anti-Putin rhetoric of Senator John McCain, Mr. Bush had abruptly amped up his opprobrium and dispatched an American airlift of humanitarian aid. And by the weekend there was a cold war chill in the air.\n\nBut Mr. Bush\u2019s predicament is not just his. The question of how to deal with these reinvigorated autocracies bedevils the Europeans and will surely rank high among the legacy issues that confound Mr. Bush\u2019s successor.\n\nThis time it is not \u2014 or not yet \u2014 the threat of nuclear apocalypse that limits the West\u2019s options toward our emboldened Eastern rivals. The Chinese, in fact, are acting as if they have gotten past the saber-rattling stage of emerging-power status; they lavish diplomacy on Taiwan and Japan, and deploy the might of capital instead. The Russians may be in a more adolescent, table-pounding stage of development, but Mr. Putin, too, prefers to work the economic levers, bullying with petroleum.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, is mired in Iraq and Afghanistan, estranged from much of the world, and bled by serial economic crises.\n\nHistory, it seems, is back, and not so obviously on our side.",

    "text": "Ten years ago on a gorgeous Tuesday morning, a pair of aircraft were flown into the World Trade Center\u2019s Twin Towers by terrorists in an attack that took thousands of lives in New York City. The attackers also struck the Pentagon, and another plane headed for Washington crashed in a field in Pennsylvania thanks to heroic acts by passengers and crew.\n\nThe deadly attacks of September 11, 2001 were a wakeup call on national security, and a threat to the American way of life. The destruction in lower Manhattan resulted in the New York Stock Exchange being closed for four straight trading days as rescuers sorted through the Trade Center for survivors, and ultimately remains.\n\nSunday marks the tenth anniversary of the tragedy, and while the attacks took an incalculable human toll, the U.S. and New York City have proven resilient in the decade since the tragedy. The NYSE reopened on Sept. 17, the following Monday, and over the ensuing decade the financial system has gotten more complex for certain, but also more accessible for millions. The NYSE itself has been transformed, first by the acquisition of Euronext and now by the pending merger with Germany\u2019s Deutsche Borse, not to mention the shift toward electronic trading that has turned the exchange\u2019s floor into a symbolic, albeit emptier, reminder of what it once was.\n\nGallery: Market Moments Since 9/11\n\nAt the time of the terrorist attacks the U.S. was still working its way through the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, and in the midst of a recession that stretched from March 2001 to November 2001.\n\nThe economy would come flying out of that period though, after an aggressive interest rate cutting cycle by the Federal Reserve, the consequences of which would lead to trouble down the road. There were other events going on that would change the way markets and businesses operate, including corporate scandals at firms like Enron, WorldCom and Tyco. Fraud and sketchy accounting at such companies would lead to Sarbanes-Oxley, a new regulatory regime that heightened the scrutiny of publicly-traded companies.\n\nDespite the dark days of 9/11, and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan in pursuit of the plot\u2019s mastermind Osama Bin Laden \u2014 who Navy Seals killed in a daring raid in Pakistan earlier this year \u2014 the U.S. has remained a place where entrepreneurs can create new businesses and succeed. The poster child of the last decade may very well be Google, which went public in a hotly-anticipated 2004 offering that raised $1.7 billion.\n\nThe economy was humming by then, with the Fed easy on interest rates and markets in the midst of a bull streak that would put the Dow Jones industrial average at its high-water mark of 14,164 by October 2007. Of course, the expansion was built on a house of cards thanks to irresponsible lending that seemed to put any American with a pulse into a new home with a brand-new car in the driveway and a vacation property in the Sun Belt.\n\nThat period of massive overleveraging by consumers would come crashing down. By early 2008 a liquidity crunch would force Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns into the arms of JPMorgan Chase and in September 158-year-old Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in a stunning turn of events that threatened to bring the entire global financial system to its knees. Extraordinary intervention from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve would keep the banking industry from complete collapse, but markets wouldn\u2019t bottom until early March, when the Dow plunged to 6,547 and the S&P 500 to 666.\n\nGallery: Market Moments Since 9/11\n\nThe bounce off that level was ferocious, but two and a half years later a fresh wave of worries are threatening global markets. Financial firms like Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are still mired in mortgage troubles and a European sovereign debt crisis threatens to produce a Lehman-like event across the Atlantic. Meanwhile, the inability of U.S. lawmakers to get a handle on government spending and the federal deficit led to Standard & Poor\u2019s knocking America down a peg and downgrading the country\u2019s AAA credit rating in early August.\n\nTen years ago thousands were killed in a heinous act that changed countless lives and put our financial system on hold. If nothing else, the decade since is a reminder that the U.S. way of life goes on. Its people, and its markets, are resilient.",

    "text": "Erik Olsen/The New York Times\n\nIF you\u2019re a chef \u2014 a great one \u2014 you will go to almost any length to gain marginal improvement in a recipe. You\u2019ll find the best provider for every given ingredient, and if you can gain an edge by fussing with those ingredients, you will. (Chances are you\u2019re not the one doing the work anyway.) These kinds of differences define the food of the most talented chefs, at least those successful enough to indulge their talents.\n\nIt\u2019s also why their recipes are often as annoying as running out of garlic.\n\nI\u2019ve spent some time trying to make those kinds of recipes more accessible, as often as not with Jean-Georges Vongerichten; we\u2019ve been friends since he moved to New York in the mid-1980s, and have written two books together.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since we worked together, but his recipe here, for fried cakes of sushi-style rice topped with chipotle mayonnaise and raw scallop, then painted with a thin glaze of a soy-honey mixture, was just irresistible. (If I were an award committee, I\u2019d give it \u201cbest of the year.\u201d)\n\nAs irresistible, for me, was the opportunity to ask J. G. how to make the thing simpler; he knows full well that the subtle differences he\u2019s employed to make this dish near-perfect can be compromised with still-terrific results.\n\nOne thing you can\u2019t mess with is the rice itself: perfectly seasoned sushi rice, made simpler by adding the fairly standard seasonings of konbu (kelp), mirin, salt and vinegar before the cooking instead of after. It\u2019s then fried, and this is the genius of the dish; it becomes a sweet rectangle of sticky crunch surrounding a sweet, tender interior. (You could probably sell it at a fast-food place with ketchup and get rich.)\n\nBut everything else (and this is per Jean-Georges, not me) is pretty much fair game. The chipotle mayonnaise is spectacular, and making mayonnaise from scratch is simple. (So simple that an essentially noncooking friend of mine, after attending one of the mayonnaise-based picnics I wrote about this summer, is now a homemade-mayonnaise fiend.)\n\nThis mayonnaise, seeking that marginal improvement, contains two kinds of oil and three sources of acidity. But there is an alternative: Jean-Georges said that when he made this dish at home, he laced bottled mayonnaise with sriracha and was happy. (I spiked my Hellmann\u2019s with piment\u00f3n, or smoked paprika, and a pinch of cayenne, and thought that wasn\u2019t bad.)\n\nSimilarly, I noted that the role of the soy-honey-vinegar mixture was so subtle, and played such a small part in the overall picture, that it might be played by plain, high-quality soy sauce; the chef agreed.\n\nBut the scallops are the big thing; one of the reasons this dish is so terrific is that the scallops Jean-Georges uses are live and in the shell just before they\u2019re sliced and layered on the fried rice cakes. Few people, myself included, are going to do this at home, or even have the option of doing this at home. What else works, I asked him?\n\nWell, basically, anything you\u2019d use for sushi: avocado, which is incredible. Good salmon (if you can find it) or tuna \u2014 or almost any other fish for that matter. Cucumber, whose cool crunch adds a different dimension. And so on.\n\nThese are not \u201clesser\u201d versions. They\u2019re just the kinds of things nonchefs or chefs cooking at home do when they don\u2019t have every possible advantage.",

    "text": "A defense attorney questioned the key witness in former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell\u2019s corruption trial on Monday about lawsuits he and his former company face over allegations of securities violations.\n\nThe line of questioning is the latest effort by defense attorneys to challenge the credibility of former Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams, who is testifying against McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, under an immunity agreement.\n\nThe McDonnells are charged with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from Williams, the former CEO of dietary supplements maker Star Scientific, in exchange for helping promote his company\u2019s products. They could face decades in prison if convicted.\n\nWilliams acknowledged Monday that Star faced about a half-dozen shareholder lawsuits, calling them \u201cnuisance suits.\u201d He also acknowledged that Star received a warning from federal regulators over Star\u2019s claims about its signature product.\n\nBob McDonnell\u2019s attorney, Henry Asbill, questioned Williams about his immunity agreement. He reminded Williams that he testified that a company\u2019s first responsibility is to stay in business.\n\n\u201cWould you agree the second rule of business is not to go to jail,\u201d Asbill asked.

    "text": "ALLENTOWN, Pennsylvania \u2014 They're house calls without the house.\n\nFar from the sterile confines of a doctor's office or hospital, Brett Feldman looks for homeless people where they're most likely to be found \u2014 in wooded encampments, under bridges, along riverbanks, at soup kitchens \u2014 and treats them for ailments ranging from diabetes to trench foot, mental illness to substance use disorders.\n\nThe 34-year-old physician assistant is one of the nation's few practitioners of \"street medicine,\" a tiny health care niche that advocates predict will become more mainstream as hospitals and health care systems seek to cut costs, in part by reducing emergency room visits among the homeless.\n\n\"My job is to bring comfort to them, and healing when I can.\"\n\nFeldman's fledgling program is showing promise. His employer, the Lehigh Valley Health Network, about an hour north of Philadelphia, has seen the number of repeat visitors to the ER plummet. Feldman delivers primary and preventive care to about 100 homeless patients per month, treating them wherever they happen to be.\n\n\"My job is to bring comfort to them, and healing when I can,\" says Feldman, wearing a backpack filled with medical supplies and bundled up against the bitter cold as he makes rounds in the sister cities of Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton.\n\nPhysician assistant Brett Feldman, left, and community outreach specialist Bob Rapp look for a pathway down to visit a homeless camp under a bridge in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\nImage: Matt Slocum / Associated Press\n\nStreet medicine got its start more than 30 years ago as an altruistic pursuit of individual doctors and nurses. In cities scattered around the country and the world, they left the office and headed outside to care for the chronically homeless, a population that is generally sicker and dies far younger than people with homes.\n\nUntil recently, though, relatively few of the 60 street medicine programs that operate nationwide have been affiliated with a hospital or health system. As health networks face increasing pressure to rein in costs, that could change.\n\nStreet medicine, Feldman says, represents the idea that \"everybody matters.\"\n\nHomeless people use the emergency room more often than the general population, stay longer and are readmitted at higher rates \u2014 a triple financial blow that's inflicting \"open wounds, bleeding wounds for hospitals,\" says Dr. Jim Withers, a street medicine pioneer who launched Pittsburgh Mercy's Operation Safety Net program in 1992.\n\nHospitals are \"probably the most front-line in terms of absorbing costs that a street medicine program would save them,\" says Withers, who cofounded the Street Medicine Institute in 2009. \"I think it's inevitable, but it hasn't happened yet ... I think in the long run, it's going to be more cost-effective to be humane.\"\n\nBehind a shuttered Allentown nightclub, Feldman meets up with Todd Hottle, 53, an intermittently homeless farmhand who likely needs hernia surgery. Hottle tells Feldman he plans to leave the hospital immediately after the procedure \u2014 the quicker to return to his tent.\n\nFeldman urges him to stay a few extra days to heal.\n\n\"Oh, man, I don't know. I really don't like that place,\" Hottle says, eliciting laughter from Feldman and his team. \"I don't like being locked up, penned up.\"\n\nDespite the good-natured grumbling, Hottle says he appreciates Feldman: \"He comes around and he checks out everybody, makes sure everybody's all right, brings down supplies. It's a good deal.\"\n\nFrom left, medical assistant Lina Marin, registered nurse Laura Lacroix, physician assistant Brett Feldman, military health care consultant Zach Laudenslager and community outreach specialist Bob Rapp walk to visit a homeless camp in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\n\nImage: Matt Slocum / Associated Press\n\nIt's a good deal for Feldman's employer, too. The street medicine program, which is funded by grant money, including a $200,000 award from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, has reduced 30-day readmission rates to Lehigh Valley Hospital from 51% to 13%. Moreover, Feldman and his team have been able to raise the rate of insured homeless from 24% to 73%, meaning the hospital gets paid more often for the care it provides.\n\n\"We have something to offer that can be instantaneous, it can be tangible.\"\n\n\"It seems to be keeping those crises down so they won't have to come in to the hospital, where it'll cost us in multiple times more,\" says Dr. Brian Nester, the health network's president and chief executive officer.\n\nOther health systems with street medicine programs report similar benefits. The program at Mount Carmel Health System in Columbus, Ohio, diverts hundreds of costly emergency visits each month, says spokeswoman Samantha Irons. A street medicine program at JPS Health Network in Fort Worth, Texas, in combination with other initiatives, is likewise driving down ER utilization, says physician assistant Joel Hunt.\n\n\"We have something to offer that can be instantaneous, it can be tangible, they can learn something about themselves on the spot. You can zero in pretty quick with the right approach and gain people's trust,\" Hunt says.\n\nPhysician assistant Brett Feldman examines Bridgete Hammerstone, 40, who is recovering from a cocaine abuse disorder and has endured long stretches of homelessness, during a check-up at a shelter in Easton, Pennsylvania.\n\nImage: Matt Slocum / Associated Press\n\nFeldman became interested in street medicine as a student volunteering at a Chicago clinic. A homeless patient told him, \"You know, I didn't always like to be like this. I used to be somebody. And I used to have steak every night for dinner.\"\n\nThe conversation lit a fire under him. \"I didn't think that anybody should have to feel like that,\" Feldman says.\n\nStreet medicine, he says, represents the idea that \"everybody matters.\"\n\nAfter meeting with Hottle, Feldman hits several other homeless hotspots. Under one bridge, he finds blankets and sleeping bags, empty cans of malt liquor, a hospital wristband and an unopened bottle of medicine \u2014 all evidence of an active encampment \u2014 but no people.\n\nFeldman collects some used hypodermic needles and deposits them in a container for medical waste, then drives to a shelter, where he sees Bridgete Hammerstone, 40, who is recovering from a cocaine use disorder and has endured long stretches of homelessness.\n\n\"Someone like Brett is a blessing to me,\" she says, \"because he opens the door to allowing the light in for the first time in life, and it's real special.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

BT has still to find a replacement for Mr Lalani, who will be assisted by Ray Leclercq, the chief executive of BT's Openreach and an experienced cost-cutter. Mr Leclercq will become chief financial officer of the troubled division.\n\nBT shares tumbled 19pc after it warned that second-quarter earnings to September 30, would be down due to the Global Services division, which it said was the only one expected to underperform in the quarter.\n\nThe board is also understood to be aware that a dividend cut may have to be on the agenda at the end of BT's financial year.\n\nBT Global Services, which employs 37,000 people worldwide, was expected by analysts to produce a margin of 10.9pc for the year to the end of March 2009. That figure is now expected to be between 7 and 8pc.\n\nThe telecoms group declined to comment on the extent of job cuts, although it is understood that they could run to thousands as the group seeks emergency efficiencies at the division, which was formed in 2002 and provides communications services to companies around the world.\n\nMr Livingston told analysts: \"Frankly, given our lack of delivery, what is going to be important is that we show quarter after quarter where we improve things. That's what I want to do ... It is now (time to) deliver and talk, rather than talk and deliver.\"\n\nBT, which has yet to find a replacement group finance director, expects 15pc year-on-year revenue growth in the Global Services division, on the back of some strong contract wins by Mr Barrault. However, earnings of around \u00a3120m will be significantly below expectations.\n\nIn July, BT, which operates in 170 countries, said it expected sales and earnings would increase this year. However, following delays in delivering cost cuts and a drop in demand from British business customers in the global services business, earnings for the whole company are expected to decline slightly. It is believed that the problems at the Global Services division date back 18 months ago when BenVerwaayen was chief executive.\n\nMr Livingston, who took over from Mr Verwaayen earlier this year, said: \"We remain committed to providing world class networked IT services to our customers. We now need to focus on improving the operational efficiency of this business to drive shareholder value. We intend to set new targets for this division as improved performance is delivered.\"\n\nBT said it will provide further information when it reports its first-half results on 13 November. The shares closed down 27 at 115.1p.",

    "text": "(CNN) \u2013 There\u2019s been a lot of debate about the Republican Party\u2019s need to rebrand after the 2012 presidential defeat, but could evangelicals face the same challenge?\n\nThe evangelical community, too, has been involved in some collective soul-searching. Evangelical leaders constantly warn that young people are deserting churches; pastors struggle to address changing views on homosexuality; and others wonder how evangelicals can remain relevant when a growing number of Americans refuse to identify with any religion.\n\nRelevant magazine, an evangelical publication, tackles these issues head-on in its latest issue with an article titled \u201c10 Challenges Facing Us in The Next Decade.\"\n\n\u201cThe future is coming faster than ever,\" the article says, \"with the tectonic plates of society, church, culture, technology, economy and environment shifting beneath us.\u201d\n\nHow the church should change to meet this future is the thrust of the article. The magazine asked some of the nation\u2019s top evangelical leaders for their take on the biggest challenges facing the church in the next decade.\n\nTheir answers varied, and some were surprising.\n\nJohn Mark McMillan, a worship leader and musician, says religious entertainers can\u2019t save evangelicals. Building more megachurches with slicker worship services that feature skits, live music and hip pastors in skinny jeans won\u2019t do the trick.\n\n\u201cHow will we avoid the temptation to simply draw crowds?\u201d McMillan asks. \u201cWhile a floating head on a Jumbotron can instruct us, I think we can only grow to maturity when we learn to love at point-blank range, where the messy aspects of relationship can\u2019t be avoided.\u201d\n\nAnother evangelical leader says making marriage relevant for a new generation is the big challenge. David Kinnaman, whose book \"You Lost Me\" examines why young evangelicals are leaving the church, says more youth see heterosexual marriage as outdated.\n\nRelevant cited statistics from the Pew Research Center that show 44% of millennials (people age 18-29) say marriage is becoming obsolete.\n\n\u201cMillennials face many challenges when it comes to marriage,\u201d Kinnaman says. \"They have more financial pressure, more readily available sexual temptations, fewer social inhibitions with infidelity, not to mention overly distracted spouses who are working hard to get ahead or \u2018screening\u2019 away their valuable time.\u201d\n\nShane Claiborne, author of \"The Irresistible Revolution\" and a founding member of an alternative community called the Simple Way, points to another challenge.\n\nHe says evangelicals must broaden the definition of \u201cpro-life.\u201d\n\nClaiborne says we live in a nation where gun violence kills 10,000 people every year, dozens are executed under the death penalty, and the threat of nuclear annihilation looms.\n\nClaiborne\u2019s suggestion: Create a Life Party of Christians who \u201cinsist on protecting life in all its dazzling forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that we can decrease and eliminate abortion, embrace the immigrant and orphans, end the death penalty in the U.S. and see poor people cared for,\u201d Claiborne says.\n\nEvangelicals can\u2019t meet the future by simply altering the delivery of their message. The message will have to change in some ways as well, says Shane Hipps, author of \"Selling Water by the River.\"\n\n\u201cThe historic strength of evangelical churches to innovate methods without altering the underlying message will no longer have the same impact,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s because the cultural shift now under way is not merely about music preferences or the use of video clips in sermons.\u201d\n\nHipps' solution for the future is to learn a lesson from the past. He cited Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German pastor martyred by the Third Reich during the closing days of World War II.\n\n\u201cWe must learn to embrace what Dietrich Bonhoeffer called 'religionless Christianity,' \u201d Hipps says. \u201cThese people will press beyond the tired religious categories of \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u201cconservative.\u2019 They will see the life and teachings of Jesus not as religious or even spiritual in nature, but rather as fundamentally human.\u201d",

Canada allowed Belarus to keep the score close through 20 minutes before breaking the game open with four second-period goals.\n\n\"We're going to get every team's best game,\" said Duchene, who had a goal and two assists against Belarus and is tied for the team lead with five points. \"The kid yesterday on Hungary that scored picked up the puck. That kind of tells you what it means to score against us and what it means to play against us. So we're going to get everybody's top game right off the bat and it's all about just staying patient, weathering the storm, and then once we get one or two, we're going from there.\"\n\nThe Canadians once again deployed a balanced attack, with seven different players scored in all situations.\n\nO'Reilly's first goal of the tournament came from a second-period short-handed marker that was ruled to have deflected into the net off his skate following a pass from Boone Jenner. The second was an own goal off the skate of a Belarusian defender at 1:26 of the third.\n\nCorey Perry, Taylor Hall and Mark Stone contributed at even strength while Derick Brassard, Duchene and Michael Matheson all scored with the man advantage as the Canadian power play went 3-for-5, rewarding coach Bill Peters for showing patience with his special teams.\n\n\"We talked about making some adjustments,\" said Peters of a power play that had gone 1-for-10 in Canada's first two games. \"We talked about possibly changing our power-play units. We felt we gained a little bit of momentum in the last game, we left them together and I think that familiarity paid off.\"\n\nKevin Lalande, a 29-year-old native of Kingston, Ont., was lifted from the Belarusian net at the 11:39 mark of the second period after giving up five goals on 18 shots. Dmitri Milchakov stopped 19 of 22 shots the rest of the way.\n\nCam Talbot was perfect in goal for Canada, making 13 saves for his first shutout of the tournament.\n\nDuchene was a member of Canada's gold-medal winning squad in Prague in 2015, and says this year's team is similarly focused on keeping good habits.\n\n\"We only allowed 13 shots so I think we're as pleased with that as with the goals we're scoring.\"\n\nHe also sees the team improving as it goes along in the tournament. \"We didn't love parts of our game against Hungary. It was a tough game to play in, they worked really hard, but so do these guys [from Belarus]. We were more structured today and played a much better game today.\"\n\nCanada has now outscored its opponents 20-2 in three games and sits at the top of the Group B standings with nine points. Finland (3-0) also has nine points after Monday's 3-2 win over the United States (1-2). Slovakia (2-0) will face Germany on Tuesday.\n\nIn Group A action in Moscow, Russia beat Latvia 4-0 to move to 2-1 in the tournament, while the Czech Republic defeated Sweden 4-2 to increase its group-leading total to eight points.

They are due to report back with their recommendations in six months.\n\nThe al Qaeda statement accused France of \"organizing its ranks to fight a new blatant war against our sisters wearing the burqa.\"\n\nCNN cannot verify the authenticity of the statement, which also accused the French of \"committing all of these grievances in a time when we see their women flooding our nations, filling our shores, poorly dressed and nude in a deliberate defiance to the feelings of Muslims and in clear contempt to the teachings of the Islamic faith, traditions and norms.\"\n\n\"Our Muslim brothers in France in particular and in Europe in general are increasingly troubled by the practices of the French politicians and their leaders, and their constant harassments of our people regarding the burqa issue,\" said the statement.\n\n\"Yesterday they targeted the veil, today the burqa and maybe tomorrow their evil hands could be extended to defame our pillars of faith, like praying, fasting or the pilgrimage,\" it added.\n\nSarkozy made the statement last week, in an address to parliament.\n\n\"The problem of the burqa is not a religious problem. This is an issue of a woman's freedom and dignity. This is not a religious symbol. It is a sign of subservience; it is a sign of lowering. I want to say solemnly, the burqa is not welcome in France,\" Sarkozy said.\n\nThe right of Muslim women to cover themselves is fiercely debated in France, which has a significant Muslim minority but also a staunchly secular constitution.\n\nIn 2004, the French parliament passed legislation banning Muslim girls from wearing head scarves in state schools, prompting widespread Muslim protests. The law also banned other conspicuous religious symbols including Sikh turbans, large Christian crucifixes and Jewish skull caps.\n\nLast year, France's top court denied a Moroccan woman's naturalization request on the grounds that she wore a burqa.\n\nBetween 5 and 10 percent of France's population of 64 million is Muslim, according to CIA estimates.

    "text": "In a suit filed yesterday in D.C. Superior Court, the attorney general's office alleges the company imposes \"unusually restrictive conditions\" on its rebates, making it \"difficult or impossible\" for consumers to obtain them.\n\nFor example, the suit alleges that for customers to qualify for some rebates, InPhonic in 2004 required them to submit a cellphone bill that was at least 120 days old -- to prove that they had stayed with their plan and made their payments. But the document had to be postmarked within 120 days of when the service was activated.\n\nIn addition, some consumers who contacted the company for assistance in obtaining rebates were routed to automated messages or to live representatives who were not helpful, the complaint said.\n\nAs a result of such policies, a majority of consumers who purchase wireless phones and plans through InPhonic either \"never receive the advertised rebates\" or are able to secure them only after following \"onerous procedures,\" the complaint said.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the company's ads from 2002 to 2005 did not display prominently enough details of discounts that required customers to maintain their wireless service for 181 days and pay their bills on time. If customers were late paying bills or switched wireless plans, their credit cards would be billed for the amount of the discount, as much as $250.\n\n\"We respectfully disagree with the Attorney General's assertion and believe we have provided clear and sufficient information, advice and direction to our customers,\" Greg S. Cole, senior vice president and corporate treasurer, said in a written statement. \"Any time you're dealing with millions of customers, as we are, there are going to be occasional concerns.\"\n\nOver the past three years, the company completed more than 2.5 million cellphone activations, Cole said. There were about 200 million cellphone subscribers in the country at the end of last year. Last year, InPhonic also \"transitioned\" to a new rebate redemption center and set up a Web site with tips for consumers on how to obtain rebates.\n\nInPhonic sells cellphones made by Motorola Inc., Samsung and other major brands, along with wireless service plans from providers such as Verizon Wireless, Cingular Wireless and T-Mobile USA Inc. through several Web sites. Founded in 1999, it went public in November 2004 and raised $108.9 million, making it one of the first local companies to pull off a successful public stock offering after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.\n\nThe company's losses widened in 2005 to $38.2 million from $10.2 million the year before. But last month, it signed a deal with Amazon.com Inc. to sell its products and services through the Seattle online retailer.\n\nLike many retailers of cellphone and wireless calling plans, InPhonic relies heavily on rebates to lower advertised prices and entice customers. When combined with discounts for long-term service plans, such rebates can help bring down the cost of a new cellphone by a substantial amount.\n\nFor example, the InPhonic-operated Web site http://www.wirefly.com/ yesterday was offering a Motorola Q phone for $169, compared with the retail price of $449. The advertised price included a discount for opening a Verizon wireless account and two rebates, one for $50 and one for $30.\n\nTo secure rebates, consumers typically must fill out a form and submit documentation, such as a receipt and product serial number, by a certain date.\n\nThe D.C. attorney general's lawsuit was based on 2,210 complaints filed with the Washington area Better Business Bureau since 2003. Bureau president and chief executive Edward Johnson said the volume of complaints made InPhonic \"one of the single most complained-about companies in the country.\"\n\nOf the total number of complaints, about 1,400 had to do with selling practices, advertising issues, credit or billing disputes, and refund practices. The company resolved 1,618 complaints.\n\nThe attorney general's suit said InPhonic customers were also stymied by the company's enforcement of rebate policies. Some consumers who sent in their paperwork on time were denied rebates after the company sent them requests for more information after the rebate deadline had passed.\n\nThe D.C. attorney general's office wants InPhonic to compensate affected consumers and to pay civil fines to be determined by the court.",

The prime minister said he was ready to consider major changes in the location of convicted terrorist prisoners to prevent them recruiting up to 1,000 current prisoners who have been identified as being at risk of extremist radicalisation.\n\n\u201cWe will not stand by and watch people being radicalised like this while they are in the care of the state \u2026 And I want to be clear \u2013 I am prepared to consider major changes: from the imams we allow to preach in prison to changing the locations and methods for dealing with prisoners convicted of terrorism offences, if that is what is required,\u201d Cameron said.\n\nHowever, a leading counter-terror expert warned that bringing together all convicted Islamist prisoners in one \u201cjail within a jail\u201d risks creating a focal point for public protests.\n\nProf Peter Neumann said: \u201cThe trade-off is this: you want to separate terrorist prisoners in order to prevent them from radicalising others yet you don\u2019t want to create a focal point for public protests \u2013 a \u2018British Guantanamo\u2019, however much of a misrepresentation that might be \u2013 or provide an opportunity for terrorist prisoners to create (or recreate) operational command structures inside prison that might not have existed outside.\u201d\n\nSince the 1960s terrorists incarcerated in England and Wales have been dispersed among six maximum security jails. They have then been regularly moved around the dispersal prisons to prevent long-term relationships building up between them.\n\nAny of the current dispersal prisons could be designated to hold all convicted Islamist terrorists and converted to create a segregated terrorist unit or \u201cjail within a jail\u201d within their perimeter. They include Frankland near Durham, Full Sutton near York, Long Lartin in Worcestershire, Wakefield in West Yorkshire, Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire, and Belmarsh in south-east London.\n\nGove\u2019s review is being led by Ian Acheson, a former prison governor and a senior Home Office official, who is understood to be actively considering recommending a separatist solution and holding convicted Islamist terrorists in one jail.\n\nDowning Street is also understood to be interested in this approach, citing recent developments in France where Islamist terrorists have been concentrated together in isolation wings to prevent them radicalising the much larger Muslim prison population in French jails.\n\n\u201cMichael Spurr [the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service] is very concerned that Acheson is going to come to the wrong conclusion,\u201d said a Whitehall source.\n\nNeumann also warned that a separatist unit could provide an opportunity to create an \u201coperational command and control structure\u201d for Isis in Britain that currently does not exist inside or outside the prison system.\n\n\u201cThe second point is now more important than ever. With large numbers of \u2018lone operators\u2019 who may not be particularly ideological and who have failed to join the command and control structures of groups like IS, the risk of them connecting with ideological and operational leaders while imprisoned is real. In other words, a policy of concentration may inadvertently help to create the kind of hierarchical organisation that the terrorists found it impossible to create outside,\u201d said Neumann.\n\nThe experience at the Maze prison in Northern Ireland in the 1980s, where republican and loyalist prisoners organised themselves along military lines and ran their respective H-blocks, is often cited as the main argument against a separatistsolution.\n\nNeumann, the author of an authoritative study comparing prison regimes for terrorist prisoners in 15 countries, said there was a trade-off involved but he thought the current British dispersal system was probably the best way of tackling the issue.\n\nThe issue of a single maximum security prison to house the most unruly and disruptive prisoners in the system was last raised in 1995 after the IRA breakout from a special secure unit at Whitemoor prison in Cambridgeshire.\n\nThe official Learmont inquiry recommended they be housed in a purpose-built US-style supermax prison because the then growing availability of explosives and weapons to criminals posed a much greater threat than before. But it was never implemented by the then home secretary, Michael Howard.\n\nBut as Neumann points out in his study, the IRA prisoners in English jails made no deliberate attempt to radicalise or recruit \u201cordinary criminals\u201d who they saw as unreliable and ill-disciplined: \u201cMany al-Qaida affiliated prisoners, on the other hand, see it as their duty to propagate their faith and political ideology and will consequently exploit whatever opportunities they are offered to approach other offenders and turn them into followers.\u201d\n\nEarly last year France started to experiment with separating suspected Islamist radicals from the general prison population at the large Fresnes jail. The \u201cquarantine\u201d programme which also tries to separate returnees from Syria and Iraq from seasoned jihadists was expanded to several Paris prisons in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attacks.\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \u201cThe justice secretary has asked the department to review its approach to dealing with Islamist extremism in prisons. This is being supported by external experts and sits alongside the cross-government work currently under way in developing deradicalisation programmes.\u201d",

    "text": "TORONTO \u2014 Canadian director Denis Villeneuve\u2019s alien invasion movie Arrival begs the question \u2014 if you could see your whole life laid out in front of you, would you change anything?\n\nWould you excise painful memories, or carry on despite knowing a difficult path ahead? It's a complex burden to carry, but five-time Oscar nominee Amy Adams makes it look effortless with her strong star turn in this well-constructed puzzle of a movie.\n\nAdams plays Dr. Louise Banks, a linguist brought in to make first contact with aliens. Known as heptapods (due to their seven feet), the aliens have touched down in 12 countries around the world, with unknown intentions. If they want to make peaceful first contact, why send 12 ships and not just one? However vague their motivations may be, there are no acts of aggression, though their mere presence is cause for concern, prompting the U.S. president to waste no time in declaring a state of emergency.\n\nThe spaceships themselves are referred to as \u201cshells\u201d in the film. The football-shaped monoliths emit no waste, gas or radiation. There\u2019s no gravity onboard, but there is a glass wall that separates the visiting humans from the aliens, who are bathed in a misty white light. But don't mistake them for the bad guys.\n\nIf there\u2019s any antagonist in Arrival, it\u2019s China, which is wary of sharing information with other governments and all too ready to demonstrate a show of force. Whatever China does, at least four more nations can safely be expected to follow its lead. That's why Adams' linguist is so important.\n\nShe approaches language like a mathematician, with the knowledge that the language you speak determines how you think. Louise also has a history of translating for the army, so she already has top secret clearance when she's recruited by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) and paired with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to answer the big question hovering in the air \u2014 \u201cWhat is your purpose on Earth?\u201d\n\nBefore they can even board the shell parked in Montana to ask, Louise and Ian must learn whether the aliens even know what a \"question\" is, and that could mean spending months teaching them rudimentary English so they\u2019ll have the tool of shared language. Louise quickly learns that there is no correlation between what the aliens say and what they write, as the heptapods\u2019 circular symbols convey no sound. Time is nonlinear for them, which explains the heptapods' nonlinear orthography, which is to say that their language can be read backwards or forwards \u2014 i.e. the same as a palindrome or, in this case, the name of Louise\u2019s late daughter, Hannah.\n\nDescribed as the foundation of civilization, the glue that holds people together \u2014 and the first weapon drawn in any conflict \u2014 language is a fascinating element to build an alien invasion movie around. Like the heptapods\u2019 written language in the film, the story of Arrival is circular.\n\nThe film opens with Louise\u2019s voiceover, explaining that \u201cmemory is a strange thing, bound by the order of time.\u201d That one line proves they key to the whole movie, which is put together like an engrossing puzzle. Looking at each piece individually, it\u2019s hard to tell where Arrival is leading, but the end of the film reveals a larger picture that brings clarity to everything that has come before it. Yes, it\u2019s one of those movies, but the layered screenplay by Eric Heisserer, who adapted Ted Chiang\u2019s short story, is the film\u2019s saving grace.\n\nThe message at the heart of the film is the importance of global unification. The people of Earth would be much stronger if we stood together as one, rather than allow borders to define and separate us. The film works hard to elicit an emotional response, employing the use of Max Richter\u2019s haunting track \"On the Nature of Daylight,\" and though I didn\u2019t cry, I was moved all the same.\n\nArrival may not be in the same league as Villeneuve\u2019s Sicario or Prisoners, but it\u2019s a thoughtful, original and ultimately satisfying sci-fi movie bolstered by a strong lead performance from Adams, who may very well have punched another ticket to the Oscars.",

If an oil well is too far beneath the sea to be plugged when something goes wrong, it\u2019s too deep to be drilled in the first place.\n\nWhen are we going to stop behaving so stupidly? We nearly wrecked the economy and we\u2019re all but buried in debt. But we can\u2019t break up the biggest banks, and we can\u2019t raise taxes. Now we\u2019re fouling the magnificent Gulf of Mexico and ruining entire communities along the southern Louisiana Coast.\n\nAnd, by the way, we\u2019re still fighting a futile war in Afghanistan that we\u2019ve been fighting with nonstop futility for nearly a decade. (I\u2019m sure the troops saddled with this thankless task were thrilled to see fans and teams demonstrating their undying support for their efforts by wearing fancy baseball caps on Memorial Day.)\n\nFor a nation that can\u2019t stop bragging about how great and powerful it is, we\u2019ve become shockingly helpless in the face of the many challenges confronting us. Our can-do spirit was put on hold many moons ago, and here we are now unable to defeat the Taliban, or rein in the likes of BP and the biggest banks, or stop the oil gushing furiously from the bowels of earth like a warning from Hades about the hubris and ignorance that is threatening to destroy us.\n\nBP and the Obama administration have been equally clueless about halting the millions of gallons of oil that have flowed into the gulf since the Deepwater Horizon explosion more than a month ago. President Obama\u2019s top adviser on energy policy, Carol Browner, unintentionally underscored the monumental futility of the response in a comment she made on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously a difficult situation,\u201d said Ms. Browner, \u201cbut it\u2019s important for people to understand that from the beginning, the government has been in charge.\u201d\n\nGot that? No one has been able to bring the crisis under control, and no one expects it to be brought under control soon, but the important thing for us to know is that the government has been in charge of this epic failure all along.\n\nHowever and whenever the well gets capped, what we really need is leadership that calls on the American public to begin coping in a serious and sustained way with an energy crisis that we\u2019ve been warned about for decades. If the worst environmental disaster in the country\u2019s history is not enough to bring about a reversal of our epic foolishness on the energy front, then nothing will.\n\nThe first thing we can do is conserve more. That\u2019s the low-hanging fruit in any clean-energy strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s fast, cheap and easy. It\u2019s something that all Americans, young and old, can be asked to participate in immediately. In that sense, it\u2019s a way of combating the pervasive feelings of helplessness that have become so demoralizing and so destructive to our long-term interests.\n\nPeople have talked about energy conservation for the longest time. But we have dawdled on making vehicles more fuel-efficient and weatherizing our homes and insisting that commercial buildings be more energy efficient, and so on. Turn those thermostats down a couple of degrees in the winter and up in the summer. Figure out ways to have a little fun while doing it.\n\nWe also need a carbon tax. The current crisis is the perfect opportunity for our political leaders to explain to the public why this is so important and what benefits would come from it.\n\nAbove all, I\u2019d like to see the creation of a second Manhattan Project that would lead us in a few years to an environment in which alternative fuels are abundant, effective and affordable. We are a pathetically weak player in that game right now.\n\nInstead of staring mesmerized at the tragedy in the gulf, like spectators at a train wreck, we should be trying to regain that innovative can-do spirit that made America the greatest of nations.\n\nAll around us is the wreckage of our failure to master the challenges confronting us. We see it in the many millions of Americans who remain out of work and whose hopes are not rising despite all the talk of economic recovery. We see it in the schools where teachers are walking the plank by the scores of thousands because of state and local budget problems.\n\nWe see it in the shrinking middle class and in the black community where depressionlike conditions are fostering not just a sense of helplessness, but despair.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is dynamic leadership (it doesn\u2019t have to come from the top) to reinvigorate the spirit of America and turn that sense of helplessness around.",

    "text": "Major U.S. poultry firms are administering antibiotics to their flocks far more pervasively than regulators realize, posing a potential risk to human health.\n\nInternal records examined by Reuters reveal that some of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest poultry producers routinely feed chickens an array of antibiotics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives.\n\nIn every instance of antibiotic use identified by Reuters, the doses were at the low levels that scientists say are especially conducive to the growth of so-called superbugs, bacteria that gain resistance to conventional medicines used to treat people. Some of the antibiotics belong to categories considered medically important to humans.\n\nThe internal documents contain details on how five major companies \u00c2 - Tyson Foods, Pilgrim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pride, Perdue Farms, George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Koch Foods\u00c2 - medicate some of their flocks.\n\nThe documented evidence of routine use of antibiotics for long durations was \u00e2\u0080\u009castonishing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Donald Kennedy, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner.\n\nKennedy, president emeritus of Stanford University, said such widespread use of the drugs for extended periods can create a \u00e2\u0080\u009csystematic source of antibiotic resistance\u00e2\u0080\u009d in bacteria, the risks of which are not fully understood. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kennedy said.\n\nReuters reviewed more than 320 documents generated by six major poultry companies during the past two years. Called \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeed tickets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the documents are issued to chicken growers by the mills that make feed to poultry companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 specifications. They list the names and grams per ton of each \u00e2\u0080\u009cactive drug ingredient\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a batch of feed. They disclose the FDA-approved purpose of each medication. And they specify which stage in a chicken\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roughly six-week life the feed is meant for.\n\nThe feed tickets examined represent a fraction of the tens of thousands issued annually to poultry farms run by or for major producers. The confidential information they contain nonetheless extends well beyond what the U.S. government knows.\u00c2 Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal and has been rising for decades. But U.S. regulators don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t monitor how the drugs are administered on the farm \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in what doses, for what purposes, or for how long.\u00c2 Made public here for the first time, the feed documents thus provide unique insight into how some major players use antibiotics.\n\nThe\u00c2 tickets\u00c2 indicate that two of the poultry producers - George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Koch Foods - have administered drugs belonging to the same classes of antibiotics used to treat infections in humans. The practice is legal. But many medical scientists deem it particularly dangerous, because it runs the risk of promoting superbugs that can defeat the life-saving human antibiotics.\n\nIn interviews, another major producer, Foster Poultry Farms, acknowledged that it too has used drugs that are in the same classes as antibiotics considered medically important to humans by the FDA.\n\nAbout\u00c2 10 percent of the feed tickets reviewed by Reuters list antibiotics belonging to medically important drug classes. But in recent presentations, scientists with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the use of any type of antibiotic, not just medically important ones, contributes to resistance. They said that whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and enables the strongest to survive and multiply.\n\nFrequent, sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in low doses intensifies that effect, scientists and public health experts say. The risk: Any resulting superbugs might also develop cross-resistance to medically important antibiotics.\n\nAccording to the feed tickets reviewed, low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some flocks at five companies: Tyson, Pilgrim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Perdue, George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Koch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones,\" said Keeve Nachman, director of the food production and public health program at Johns Hopkins University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nThis month, Perdue Farms announced that it had stopped applying the antibiotic gentamicin to eggs in chicken hatcheries. Gentamicin is a member of an antibiotic class considered \u00e2\u0080\u009chighly important\u00e2\u0080\u009d in human medicine by the FDA. The company said it wants \u00e2\u0080\u009cto move away from conventional antibiotic use\u00e2\u0080\u009d because of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrowing consumer concern and our own questions about the practice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe move won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change what Perdue feeds its chickens, however. Some of its feed has contained low levels of one antibiotic, feed tickets show. Perdue said it only uses antibiotics that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t considered medically important by the FDA, and at some farms, it uses no antibiotics at all.\n\nThe manner in which drugs are being given to poultry shows that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe recognized that the public was concerned about the potential impact of the use of these drugs on their ability to effectively treat humans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bruce Stewart-Brown, Perdue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior vice president of food safety and quality, said when the hatchery policy was announced.\n\nThe poultry industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people. \u00c2\n\n\"Several scientific, peer reviewed risk assessments demonstrate that resistance emerging in animals and transferring to humans does not happen in measurable amounts, if at all,\" said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council. He said using antibiotics to prevent diseases in flocks \u00e2\u0080\u009cis good, prudent veterinary medicine\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Prevention of the disease prevents unnecessary suffering and prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPoultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food.\n\nOver the years, the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of antibiotics grew. Early on, independent scientists warned that bacteria would inevitably develop resistance to those antibiotics, especially when the drugs were administered in low doses. In 1976, a landmark study by microbiologist Stuart Levy showed that potentially deadly bacteria in poultry were developing resistance to tetracyclines and other antibiotics. The resistant bacteria, E. Coli, were then moving from poultry to people.\n\nThat is when the FDA first tried to rein in drug use in food animals. The agricultural and pharmaceutical industries resisted, viewing low-level antibiotic use as a way to produce meat more quickly and cheaply.\n\nToday, 80 percent of all antibiotics used in America are given not to people, but to livestock.\n\nAbout 390 medications containing antibiotics have been approved to treat illness, stave off disease and promote growth in farm animals. But the FDA has reviewed just 7 percent\u00c2 of those drugs for their likelihood of creating antibiotic-resistant superbugs, a\u00c2 Reuters data analysis found.\n\nThe widespread use of antibiotics worries public health authorities. In a report this year, the World Health Organization called antibiotic resistance \u00e2\u0080\u009ca problem so serious it threatens the achievements of modern medicine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The annual cost to battle antibiotic-resistant infections is estimated at $21 billion to $34 billion in the United States alone, the WHO said.\n\nEach year, about 430,000 people in the United States become ill from food-borne bacteria that resist conventional antibiotics, according to a July report by the CDC. Overall, the CDC estimates that 2 million people are sickened in the United States annually with infections resistant to antibiotics. At least 23,000 people die.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the number we are certain of. The actual number is higher,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Steve Solomon, director of the CDC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Antimicrobial Resistance.\n\nThis year, federal investigators tracking a salmonella outbreak traced virulent strains of the pathogen to chickens raised by Foster Farms, the largest poultry producer on the West Coast.\n\nInvestigators identified seven strains of Salmonella Heidelberg that had sickened at least 634 people across the United States and Puerto Rico this year and last. More than 200 of those people were hospitalized, according to the CDC. In July, Foster Farms issued a recall of some chicken products.\n\nWhen epidemiologists examined 68 of the Salmonella Heidelberg cases linked to Foster Farms, they found that two-thirds of the bacteria were resistant to at least one antibiotic, according to the CDC. Half of these superbugs were impervious to drugs in at least three different classes of antibiotics.\n\nIn an effort to stop the spread of resistant bacteria, the FDA has issued voluntary guidelines to regulate antibiotic use by producers of poultry and other livestock. The agency says it also inspects the mills where animal feed is made. It considers those inspections to be\u00c2 a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore effective\u00e2\u0080\u009d use of its resources than\u00c2 examining how farmers administer feed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\n\nNot until 2016 does the FDA plan to gather data about antibiotic use on farms, said Craig Lewis, a veterinary medical officer with the agency. Today, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnone of us have an idea first-hand of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the farm level, Lewis said this summer, at a public meeting on antibiotic resistance.\n\nSuper, the National Chicken Council spokesman, said the information on feed tickets \u00e2\u0080\u009cis available to FDA, the regulators, whenever they want to go see it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStill, companies are reluctant to discuss how they medicate their flocks.\n\nOne, Pilgrim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pride, said it would take legal action against Reuters unless the news agency gave the company access to Pilgrim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feed tickets that reporters had reviewed. Reuters declined to do so.\n\nThe tickets show that Pilgrim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s added low doses of the antibiotics bacitracin and monensin, individually or in combination, to every ration fed to a flock grown early this year. Neither drug is classified as medically important by the FDA, although bacitracin commonly is used to prevent human skin infections.\n\nThe Colorado-based company wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t address questions about its use of antibiotics. Its general counsel, Nicholas White, called the contents of its tickets \u00e2\u0080\u009cconfidential business information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nU.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said the feed tickets substantiate what she long suspected: \"that the overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGillibrand has been pushing for regulators to more aggressively monitor low-level doses of antibiotics. Now, Gillibrand said, she hopes \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe FDA will use the feed-ticket data obtained by Reuters as a wake-up call to re-evaluate their approach to the regulation of antibiotic use in food production.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo does Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, a member of a House subcommittee overseeing food safety. Told of the information in the feed tickets, DeLauro called on the FDA to \u00e2\u0080\u009cimplement tighter restrictions on antibiotic usage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll the poultry giants state publicly that they use antibiotics for the limited purpose of keeping chickens healthy.\n\nBut the feed tickets, which list the medications included in chicken feed, highlight a second effect\u00c2 of many of the drugs: bulking up the birds.\n\nSome of the tickets reviewed for this article state that the antibiotics promote feed efficiency or weight gain in chickens. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on feed tickets whenever feed includes antibiotics that have been approved for that purpose.\n\nNOURISHMENT: Some Perdue flocks receive feed with an antibiotic, others don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; here, Perdue feed containing a non-medically important antibiotic called narasin at C&A Farms in Fairmont, North Carolina.

The tickets show that\u00c2 the antibiotics tylosin and virginiamycin were administered solely for \u00e2\u0080\u009cincreased rate of weight gain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTylosin belongs to a class of antibiotics the FDA considers \u00e2\u0080\u009ccritically important\u00e2\u0080\u009d in human medicine, the most crucial of three ranks of sensitive drugs.\u00c2 Virginiamycin is part of a class in the FDA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s middle rank, \u00e2\u0080\u009chighly important.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOther George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Inc feed tickets, given to two growers in Virginia this year, show the antibiotics bacitracin and narasin and a non-antibiotic drug called nicarbazin were included in every poultry ration in different combinations until shortly before slaughter. Bacitracin can promote growth.\n\nGeorge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said in a statement: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOccasionally (when necessary to control certain pathogens) appropriate FDA approved medications are utilized to prevent, control or treat specific diseases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It declined to answer detailed questions.\n\nUse of antibiotics to stave off disease in flocks \u00e2\u0080\u009cis good, prudent veterinary medicine\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Prevention of the disease \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt Tyson Foods, two feed tickets sent by the company to two Mississippi farms show that bacitracin and the non-antibiotic nicarbazin were among the drugs mixed into the feed. The tickets state the drug combination is \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor use in the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler flocks, growth promotion and feed efficiency.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coccidiosis is a common intestinal ailment.\n\nTyson, also based in Springdale, Arkansas, said it does not use bacitracin to promote growth, only to prevent disease. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on tickets if medications have that effect, Tyson said. The company said that its feed mixture changes throughout the year. In some seasons, it said, the feed doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include bacitracin and nicarbazin.\n\nAt Koch Foods Inc, a Chicago-based supplier to fast-food chain KFC Corp, feed tickets contradict a statement on the Koch website about antibiotic use.\n\nUntil Aug. 27, the website said Koch Foods uses antibiotics for the narrow purpose of protecting the health of its chickens. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not administer antibiotics at growth promotion doses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the\u00c2 statement read in part. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo antibiotics of human significance are used to treat our birds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nKoch feed tickets dated from Nov. 30, 2011, through July 20, 2014, indicate otherwise. They list low-dose amounts of five different types of antibiotics in feed given to flocks at one Alabama farm. One was virginiamycin, in a class\u00c2 considered \u00e2\u0080\u009chighly important\u00e2\u0080\u009d to fighting infections in humans.\n\nIn 34 of the 55 Koch Foods feed tickets that Reuters examined, antibiotics at low-dose levels were listed \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor increased rate of weight gain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a related growth-promotion use called \u00e2\u0080\u009cimproved feed efficiency,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or both. Each of those feed tickets also said the antibiotics were for the prevention of coccidiosis, another bacterial infection, or both.\n\nKoch Foods changed the website after being asked by Reuters about its use of virginiamycin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI regret the wording mistake on that particular letter\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the website, said Mark Kaminsky, Koch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief financial officer. The company said it is required by the FDA to list certain drugs as growth promoters if they have that effect; Koch says it does not use them for that purpose.\n\nKoch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.\n\nKFC U.S. said in a statement: \u00e2\u0080\u009cKFC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regulations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A spokeswoman didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t address detailed questions about antibiotic use by Koch Foods and KFC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other chicken suppliers.\n\nThe experience of one grower raises questions about whether preventive use of antibiotics has a meaningful effect on the health of chicken.\n\nCraig Watts, who grows chicken for Perdue, says he sees little difference in outcomes for\u00c2 the birds he raises on feed containing an antibiotic and those he grows for the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antibiotic-free line.\n\nPerdue mixes the antibiotic narasin into feed given to chickens in the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antibiotic-fed line. Its antibiotic-free line contains antimicrobial drugs that kill micro-organisms, but none that the FDA defines as an antibiotic, according to Perdue feed tickets shown by Watts. None of the drugs listed by Perdue on the feed tickets is considered medically important for humans.\n\nWatts owns C&A Farms, about 20 miles north of Dillon, South Carolina. Since 2012, he has raised five antibiotic-free flocks for Perdue and seven flocks that received low doses of the antibiotic narasin, according to his records.\n\nThe mortality rates of the two flock types were nearly identical. About 900 birds died, per house, on the four-house farm. Flocks that received\u00c2 antibiotics and those that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t both hit Perdue's target weight of about 4.25 pounds per bird.\n\nPerdue sees \u00e2\u0080\u009csimilar\u00e2\u0080\u009d performance among birds fed antibiotics and those that do not receive the drugs, said Stewart-Brown, the Perdue official overseeing food safety. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe feel our current two approaches are both very responsive to public health concerns about antibiotic use in poultry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPerdue still uses antibiotics in some cases, because antibiotic-free flocks are \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore expensive to run and more difficult to manage effectively,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stewart-Brown said. The production complex served by Watts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 farm recently transitioned to all antibiotic-free flocks.\n\nOne poultry giant whose antibiotic use has come into question is Foster Farms, based in Livingston, California. Its experience shows the difficulty of pinpointing when and how a bacteria turns into a superbug, say federal investigators.\n\nBeginning last year, a salmonella outbreak spread across Oregon, Washington, California and 27 other states and territories. Federal investigators later linked the outbreak to chickens raised by Foster Farms and processed at a trio of its slaughterhouses in central California, according to USDA and CDC officials.\n\nThe scope of the outbreak reflected Foster Farms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vast scale. Its operations in California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Central Valley date to 1939, when Max and Verda Foster borrowed $1,000 against a life insurance policy and invested in an 80-acre farm.\n\nToday, Foster owns large tracts of California farmland, chicken hatcheries in Colorado and train cars that haul grain from the Midwest. An estimated one of 10 chickens eaten in the United States is hatched, raised and slaughtered by Foster Farms, according to industry officials. The company dominates the chicken market west of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nAs the CDC studied what investigators informally called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFoster Farms Outbreak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d researchers soon made a troubling discovery. Some of the Salmonella Heidelberg strains linked to Foster products proved resistant to a variety of antibiotics, the CDC concluded. Some of those drugs belonged to the same classes as penicillin and chlortetracycline, or CTC.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSome questions remain. Government investigators didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t determine how the Salmonella Heidelberg traced to Foster Farms became resistant to antibiotics, and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trace the resistant bacteria to specific farms. They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t examine Foster feed tickets from the outbreak period to see which antibiotics the company was using and how the drugs were being administered.\n\nReuters asked to see Foster Farms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feed tickets from that period; the company didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t respond to that request.\n\nFoster Farms said it commissioned research that yielded findings very different from the CDC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. The company declined to share the study. It summarized the research by saying scientists found no antibiotic resistance in two dozen salmonella samples collected from Foster Farms in 2012.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman said the agency is aware that Foster Farms sponsored a study and has asked to review it, but hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t received a copy.\n\nFoster Farms told Reuters it has administered CTC and penicillin at times, but selectively, not as part of standard feed. Foster said it had used CTC \u00e2\u0080\u009cas needed\u00e2\u0080\u009d to fight bacterial infections. It declined to say where or when it administered CTC. The company said it still uses penicillin to treat sick birds, but only \u00e2\u0080\u009cin critical situations when flocks are exposed to fatal diseases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Foster doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use antibiotics as growth promoters, it said.\n\nCDC official Robert Tauxe helped investigate the outbreak. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUse of chlortetracycline could have contributed to the resistance patterns we saw\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the Salmonella Heidelberg, said Tauxe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPenicillin, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn July 11, the CDC said the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak had ended. The USDA said it is monitoring the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new salmonella-prevention efforts. Agency officials and Foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief veterinarian, Bob O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connor, said the measures are working.\n\nThe company has reduced salmonella-infection rates on chicken meat from its California facilities to less than 3 percent, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connor said, far below the national average of 25 percent.\n\nDespite the gains, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connor said the challenge of eradicating salmonella in the chicken industry remains. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the people who wanted a silver-bullet-type story, there isn't one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connor said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith salmonella, we're not going to be able to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It's over.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDavid Acheson, a former senior medical officer for the USDA and the FDA, now serves on a food safety advisory board for Foster Farms. He said the board never examined Foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of antibiotics and whether its practices could have spawned superbugs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes anyone know that it happened? No. Is it possible? Could it have happened? Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Acheson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know that antibiotic use, irrelevant of what you are treating, whether it be human or animal, can increase the likelihood of resistance. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biology at work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nReporting by P.J.

    "text": "FILE - In this Oct. 27, 2009 file photo, a cable car passes a parking meter near San Francisco's financial district. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, File)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 San Francisco's city attorney issued a cease-and-desist demand Monday to a mobile app called Monkey Parking, which allows people to auction public parking spaces that they're using to other nearby drivers.\n\nIn a letter to Paolo Dobrowolny, the CEO of the Rome, Italy-based tech startup, city attorney Dennis Herrera cited a provision in San Francisco's police code that prohibits people and companies from buying, selling or leasing public on-street parking and mandates fees of up to $300 for drivers who violate the law.\n\nHerrera's warning to Monkey Parking is the latest attempt by city government officials and state lawmakers nationwide trying to figure out how to regulate Web-based businesses that offer shared parking, transportation and housing services using mobile applications. Among the more popular ridesharing services are Uber and Lyft, and popular housing apps include Airbnb.\n\nThe Monkey Parking app allows drivers to get an often elusive parking spot and sell it for $5, $10, even $20, and then wait until the buyer arrives to take their place.\n\nHerrera has given its creators until July 11 to shut down operations in San Francisco or possibly face a lawsuit under California's Unfair Competition Law. Herrera added that besides the violations, Monkey Parking's app encourages drivers to unsafely use their mobile devices and engage in online parking bidding wars while behind the wheel.\n\nDobrowolny said in an email Monday that he is talking with his legal staff and didn't immediately have a specific comment about the letter.\n\n\"As a general principle, we believe that a new company providing value to people should be regulated and not banned,\" Dobrowolny wrote. \"This applies also to companies like Airbnb, Uber and Lyft that are continuously facing difficulties while delivering something that makes users happy. Regulation is fundamental in driving innovation, while banning is just stopping it.\"\n\nThe city attorney's warning to Monkey Parking comes about a month after his office started investigating the startup, which began its San Francisco operations in April.\n\n\"Technology has given rise to many laudable innovations in how we live and work -- and Monkey Parking is not one of them. It's illegal, it puts drivers on the hook for $300 fines, and it creates a predatory private market for public parking spaces that San Franciscans will not tolerate,\" Herrera said in a written statement. \"People are free to rent out their own private driveways and garage spaces should they choose to do so. But we will not abide businesses that hold hostage on-street public parking spots for their own private profit.\"\n\nParking in San Francisco has long been known as a driver's worst nightmare. A recent San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency parking census reported that the city has 440,000 parking spots available -- but only 275,000 of those are street parking.\n\nHerrera's letter to Monkey Parking also asked Apple Inc. to immediately remove Monkey Parking from its app store. Apple did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nSan Francisco-based technology expert Charles Belle, who runs the Startup Policy Lab, whose objective is to connect the startup community with policymakers and government, believes the issue between Monkey Parking and the city attorney is a great example of the need to create more forums for the two entities to engage.\n\n\"Companies need to be familiar with local laws, but threatened legal actions, such as cease-and-desist letters, only divert attention away from the opportunity to rethink how the community can use technology to improve government services,\" said Belle, who's a former executive director the Privacy and Technology Project at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law.\n\nTwo other tech companies, Sweetch and ParkModo, which Herrera said also violates city and state laws, will receive similar cease-and-desist warnings later this week. Sweetch co-founder Hamza Ouazzani Chahdi, whose $5-per-parking-spot swapping app was also warned to cease and desist, said Monday the goal is just to reduce congestion, which creates pollution and other problems.\n\n\"We don't understand why they want to shut us down. We are trying to solve the huge parking problem, which is not only bad for drivers but for all the city,\" he said.\n\nParkModo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

Motherly innkeepers, spick-and-span bathrooms, some of the cheapest room rates in town plus an ambiance of spirituality, more than compensate for any inconvenience, making convents an attractive lodging option for travelers in Italy.\n\n\"We feel very, very secure here, which is very important when you are in a strange country,\" said Joan Shoti, a middle-aged woman from Sydney, Australia, staying at Fraterna Domus, a hotel run by nuns whose religious mission is hospitality.\n\nThe hotel is \"the most spotless place you can imagine, but the most important thing is the caring you get from these nuns,\" said Shoti. \"Of course, nowadays you feel very insecure traveling, but when one stops in a place like this, one feels totally safe.\"\n\nSister Milena, who helps run the 40-guest Fraterna Domus inn a few blocks from Piazza Navona, said the Missionaries of the Fraterna Domus (Latin for \"brotherly house\") was among the first to have lodgings for tourists and pilgrims.\n\n\"Now everybody does it,\" said Sister Milena. \"We carry out the charisma of hospitality.\"\n\nMany of the convents started opening their doors to paying guests in the run-up to the Holy Year in 2000, when the religious and millennium celebrations drew 25 million visitors to Rome.\n\nWorried about a shortage of hotel rooms, the government offered low-cost mortgages and remodeling loans to convents and monasteries.\n\nMassimiliano Vavassori, a researcher for the Milan-based Touring Club Italiano, which monitors tourist trends in the country and publishes a guide to convent lodgings, said there are no firm figures on how many convents are now in the lodging business or how much revenue the guests generate.\n\n\"More than 50 percent of the religious places aren't registered\" as lodgings, Vavassori said. In some cases, \"it's a case of a friend lending help. You can (just) leave an offering since the hospitality is offered for charity, not for business,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\nSister Milena said the nuns occasionally take in \"desperate\" travelers whom the police find wandering around Rome in the night with nowhere to sleep.\n\nThose guests aren't charged, she said. But paying guests at convents get a good deal in Rome, where modest hotels can charge upward of $190 a night for a double and hostels are rare.\n\nCatholics and non-Catholics alike are among the guests at Fraterna Domus who pay $104 a night for a room with twin beds, private bathroom and fluffy towels emblazoned with the convent's name. A crucifix is affixed in each room.\n\nMany convents also serve bargain-priced dinners, cooked by nuns who ladle out pasta, soup and salad and pass around carafes of wine for guests and for diners who walk in off the street. Nuns clean the bathrooms and make the beds, helping to keep costs down.\n\nDon't look for baskets of complimentary toiletries in these nunneries, and many of the rooms have no TV, wet bars or even phones. But intangibles abound.\n\n\"There are pilgrims who need (human) contact, a word,\" said Sister Martina, who helps direct Casa Mater Mundi, an 88-bed hotel which opened in the Holy Year in a residential neighborhood in Rome.\n\n\"There's a chapel. Some (guests) pray. Some even pray with us. There's apostolate in that,\" Sister Martina said. \"I'm not saying we preach, but when we respond to them, our response is religious.\"\n\n\"Sometimes it happens that a person confides a problem in us. We invite them to pray, or we pray for them,\" said the nun.\n\nSister Martina insisted that Holy Year financial breaks didn't influence their decision to open the hotel, which was once a convent that her order, the Sisters of the Institute of Divine Love, purchased from Franciscan nuns with dwindling members.\n\nThe place, with a garden shaded by leafy palm trees and towering pines, was needed primarily for novitiates who come from Peru and the Philippines to study, Sister Martina said.\n\n\"At first we had only expenses,\" said Sister Martina, citing the remodeling to meet European Union safety standards and to give guests private bathrooms, TVs and phones. \"But now there is some money left over\" from the lodging business to help the nuns in poor countries.\n\nMater Mundi has an 11 p.m. curfew, a little later than some other convents, and some double beds, compared to the twin beds many other convent hotels offer even to married couples.\n\nRev. Gregory Apparcel, of Santa Susanna church, which administers to the U.S. Catholic community in Rome, said he hears some complaints about curfews, but \"most people don't care. They are dead tired by 9 p.m.\" after a day of pounding the cobblestones of Rome.\n\n\"I know there are a lot more people going\" to convents \"because I get a lot of people writing\" for information, said Apparcel, whose church's Web site lists convent lodgings in Italy. \"Since Pope John Paul II died, the number has jumped enormously.\"\n\nVavassori of Touring Club Italiano said that while modest prices are the big attraction of religious lodgings in Rome, convents and monasteries are popular in mountain and other remote, panoramic places because they often are the only lodging around for miles.",

Known as the S&P BMI U.K. Index, it is worth just $2.8 trillion.\n\n\"The current stock market selloff has spurred flashbacks for previous financial crises,\" Merrill Lynch chief investment officer Christopher Hyzy wrote in a research report on Tuesday.\n\nRelated: Why U.S. stocks aren't headed for a crash\n\n2014, 2015 gains wiped out\n\nThe heart stopping part of of the market slide occurred on Monday, with the Dow's unprecedented 1,089-point decline just minutes after the opening bell.\n\nThe recent turmoil has wiped out not only 2015's stock market gains but nearly all of 2014's as well. The Dow ended Tuesday at the lowest level since February 2014.\n\nThe dramatic retreat on Wall Street has been fueled by serious concerns about the fallout of China's economic slowdown. While everyone already knew China's economy was no longer enjoying explosive growth, investors have seized on possible new signs the slowdown is more serious.\n\nRelated: Stocks in 9 countries meet the scary bear\n\nChina's market shocks, economy questions\n\nChina's stock market imploded earlier in the summer. It wasn't clear if it was simply the bursting of a stock market bubble or a red flag about deeper issues in China's economy.\n\nAnd then China shocked markets by devaluing its currency, the yuan, on August 11. The move smacked some as a desperate attempt to boost exports by making its goods cheaper to foreign buyers.\n\nFears deepened last week when a key gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity plummeted to the lowest level since the global financial crisis. All of this has had the combined effect of sending the Chinese stock market down over 40% just in the last two months.\n\nRelated: Don't panic! China has problems, not a crisis\n\nBut do these credible concerns about China's economy justify the huge selloff on Wall Street? And are further large losses in the cards?\n\nMerrill Lynch argues that U.S. equities \"remain vulnerable\" in the near term because stocks have broken down below several key levels and momentum stocks are tumbling.\n\nYet unlike the stock market, the American economy is not tanking. Just on Wednesday Barclays boosted its tracking estimate of third-quarter gross domestic growth to 2.8%. That's nowhere near a recession. In the current environment of lackluster global economic growth, that actually qualifies as pretty strong.\n\nRelated: Why the economy is OK, even if stocks aren't\n\nAnd it's not like interest rates are shooting higher, creating a drag on stocks. Central bankers around the world are flooding the system with cash and keeping rates extremely low. Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve, signaled the U.S. central bank may shelve its plans to raise rates next month until later in the year or even 2016.\n\n\"The positive fundamentals of improving economic growth and accommodative monetary policies in developed markets remain intact, supporting equities over bonds,\" Merrill Lynch wrote.\n\nIf the economy isn't collapsing, then that means corporate profits should remain relatively solid, outside of the oil-ravaged energy sector. Profits are critical to stock prices.\n\nRelated: The mysterious 21% plunge in GE's stock\n\nIs now the time to bargain hunt?\n\nBut prices have tumbled in recent days, seemingly undercutting the argument that American stocks are too expensive.\n\nJust look at the Dow's price-to-earnings ratio, a key valuation metric. On average Dow stocks now trade for 15.5 times this year's expected earnings and only 14 times next year's, according to ConvergEx. While that's not exactly dirt cheap, it's a big improvement from multiples north of 18 just a few months ago.\n\nAnd if the markets go even lower in the current volatility \"we're getting to levels where the fundamentals show compelling value,\" said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx, in a note.\n\nRelated: The stock market drop...by the numbers\n\nRelated: This is not the time to dump your stocks\n\nCNNMoney (New York) August 26, 2015: 4:32 PM ET",

    "text": "THIRTY years ago, a 1952 Cunningham C-3 sports car sat forlorn in a Queens junkyard, many of its original parts \u2014 transmission, dashboard, instruments and windshield \u2014 cannibalized for who knows what.\n\nThe coupe, designated chassis No. 5232 and one of only about two dozen C-3s produced, was rescued from the shredder and destined for restoration. But as happens with many well-intended collector-car projects, it bounced from owner to owner until Lou Natenshon, an architect in Highland Park, Ill., found it on eBay about 10 years ago.\n\nIn January, after years of chasing replacement parts and investing what he said was a significant amount of money, Mr. Natenshon displayed his coupe at a concours d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9gance here on the grounds of the Mar-a-Lago resort, a Donald Trump property. Though the restoration was not complete \u2014 the body gleamed in its fresh blue-and-silver paint job, but interior work remained to be done \u2014 he was not going to miss this gathering, which promoters had promised would be the largest gathering ever of cars built by the B. S. Cunningham Company.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, I remember reading about Briggs Cunningham in my father\u2019s Esquire magazine,\u201d said Mr. Natenshon, 70. \u201cI always liked his idea of a custom coachwork body powered by an American engine. What could be better than an American hot rod with Italian bodywork?\u201d\n\nThe cars were the creation of Briggs Swift Cunningham II, born in 1907 to a wealthy Cincinnati family of Scottish heritage. Mr. C, as he was known, had a strong competitive drive, evident even as a young man. Whether it was golf, football or sailing, he had to win.\n\nCunningham\u2019s early exposure to racing made a lasting impression on him. An uncle who had installed a surplus Hispano-Suiza airplane engine in a Dodge touring car after World War I let young Briggs accompany him on Sunday afternoon rides. They challenged all comers in stoplight races.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember anybody ever beating us,\u201d Cunningham, who died in 2003, told Dean Batchelor and Albert R. Bochroch, the authors of \u201cCunningham, the Life and Cars of Briggs Swift Cunningham\u201d (Motorbooks International, Osceola, Wis., 1993).\n\nCunningham got serious about racing after World War II, with a particular interest in endurance events. Even though few Americans had entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France, Cunningham was determined to win it with American cars and drivers.\n\nIn 1950, he entered two Cadillac Coupe DeVilles in the race, a competition famous for its brutal demands on cars. One car remained close to showroom form while the other was modified by a group of engineers and workers moonlighting from their day jobs at Grumman, the aircraft maker in Bethpage, Long Island. That car, an open-cockpit design dressed in boxy body panels the team had fabricated, was so ungainly that French racing fans nicknamed it Le Monstre. Incredibly, the two Cadillacs finished 10th and 11th against a field of Ferraris, Aston Martins and Jaguars. The challenge was on.\n\nCunningham quickly hatched plans to win Le Mans outright in cars of his own design, painted in the traditional racing colors of the country they represented. Italian entries were painted red, French racing cars were blue and the English painted their cars British racing green.\n\nTrouble was, in 1950 the United States did not have an established national racing color. But Germany\u2019s switch to silver for the team livery, from white, created an opening. So Cunningham invented a color scheme that would represent America for decades: white with two wide blue stripes \u2014 called Cunningham stripes at the time \u2014 that stretched front to back.\n\nThat paint job became known well beyond the racetrack. In 1954, an illustration of Cunningham and three of his Le Mans racecars appeared on the cover of Time magazine, helping to solidify his growing reputation as a versatile all-American sportsman.\n\nIn 1951, Cunningham relocated his racing operation from Connecticut to West Palm Beach, Fla., and over the next five years built and raced his own cars. Under the rules of the era, competitors were required to manufacture small runs of road cars to qualify for some international events.\n\nTo comply, Cunningham had to produce at least 25 roadworthy examples of the same model as the racecars, so in 1952, the Continental C-3 was introduced. An ambitious team of hot rodders at the West Palm Beach plant installed 331-cubic-inch Chrysler hemi V-8s in racing chassis, which were then shipped to Turin, Italy, where a coachbuilder, Vignale, fabricated bodywork of aluminum and steel.\n\nWith the body panels in place, the cars returned to Florida, where assembly was completed. Cunningham built 20 coupes and five convertibles with the Vignale bodywork, according to Larry Berman, who chronicles the company\u2019s history at briggscunningham.com. There were also two early cars built with Cunningham-made body panels.",

    "text": "In Mitchell S. Jackson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerful debut novel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Residue Years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we know how things will end for Champ Thomas and his mother, Grace, before we know how they get there. In the prologue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of the few I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read that is organic to the story that follows \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a mother is visiting her son in prison. This imbues what follows with a sense of hopelessness that becomes ever sharper in contrast to the novel itself, which is, in its way, full of impossible hope.\n\nTold in chapters that alternate between Champ and Grace, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Residue Years\u00e2\u0080\u009d describes a black family in Portland, Ore., trying hard to remain a family. Grace is just out of rehab, hoping to stay straight and get her kids back, to make up for all the wrong she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done. Her eldest, Champ, who recognizes his own sharp intelligence, is in college and living with a girlfriend he loves and disappoints in near equal measure. Champ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two younger brothers live with their father and have started to distance themselves from Grace in the way of children let down one time too many. For both Grace and Champ, bringing the family back together might offer a way to something better.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Residue Years\u00e2\u0080\u009d is also about cycles of poverty and addiction, and as such it offers a stark look at the ravages of drugs in black urban neighborhoods. Champ slings crack to support his family, unapologetic because it brings in money and he has responsibilities. He also has a dream: He wants to buy the house where he remembers being happiest, even though a new family lives there now and the house is not for sale. Grace gets a legitimate job, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never far from the influences that have always held her back. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just too much temptation in too many places, and most of the time she has to face that temptation alone. The beating heart of this novel is a journey toward a home that is always just beyond grasp no matter how fiercely Grace and Champ reach. Their story is as moving as it is unbearable.\n\nJackson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prose has a spoken-word \u00c2\u00adcadence, the language flying off the page with percussive energy, as when Champ takes his brothers to the barbershop: \u00e2\u0080\u009cKJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambivalent about his cut. Looks to me, with his shoulders hiked. My bro is always demurring, always deferring. But since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 0.00 percent of reclaiming a vacated seat, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be no assurance from intimate distance today. Give him a low one-lengther, I say from my perch. Dude\u00e2\u0080\u0099s averse to cuts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere is warmth and wit, and a hard-won wisdom about the intersection of race and poverty in America. Before Grace finds work, she has to contend with a complicated past that includes time in prison; most employers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interested in \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplicated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When she does get a job, she has to pay court fees and fines and feed herself, all on a fast-food worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wages. There is no way up and no way out.\n\nChamp, meanwhile, has always known the limits of his options. He played basketball in high school but wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite good enough to make it to the next level \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make a name for himself, or even a nickname. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca nickname is a christening, meaning you got a shot, meaning they think you can go, which is one chance more than most of us, so no wonder the chosen are all there is to speak of. No wonder when, for most, hoop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about our only shot to be better and bigger than the rest, to secure a life that counts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That Champ keeps trying to have a life that counts despite the odds is one more way this novel treads so finely between hope and despair.\n\nOne of the most affecting of Jackson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choices comes by way of the blank forms he intersperses with the prose: a drug diversion contract, new member registration for a church, a petition for child custody, a police report. These forms are presented without context, but they reveal how the very institutions meant to serve often fail us instead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Residue Years\u00e2\u0080\u009d is an autobiographical novel, and at times Jackson has so much empathy for his characters that he understandably sacrifices plot. He demonstrates more devotion to the truth than to fiction. We know Grace and Champ inside out. We see all their failings and the desperation of their hopes. Though that is in many ways the point of this novel, the story stagnates in scenes that seem written to satisfy the writer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s need to remember more than the reader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s need to know.\n\nIt would be easy to suggest that \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Residue Years\u00e2\u0080\u009d is \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout\u00e2\u0080\u009d race, since it revolves around black people and their lives. Yet if that assumption is reductive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the novel also takes a raw, hard look at poverty, after all, and how it holds people so firmly in the very places they want to escape \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely wrong, either. In his advanced speech class, Champ gives a presentation about the disproportionate criminal penalties for crack-related drug offenses. After a classmate suggests that not everything is about race, Champ answers: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, not everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about race. But what if this is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoxane Gay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn Untamed State,\u00e2\u0080\u009d will be published in 2014.",

    "text": "VIERA, FLA. -- And so it begins, the Stephen Strasburg era. It begins -- the hype, the hope, the scrutiny. It begins like this: Monday morning, five days before the Washington Nationals' pitchers and catchers are to report for spring training, on a back field at the team's minor league complex. A couple dozen players are gathered for an informal pre-camp workout.\n\nAnd then Strasburg, 21, steps onto a bullpen mound -- dressed minimally in a white Billabong T-shirt, gray athletic shorts and black Nike spikes, no socks -- and signals to his catcher that a fastball is coming. As it leaves his right hand, humming and hell-bent, his new teammates are divided into two categories: those who are sneaking glances at the phenom, and those who are outright gawking.\n\n\"I'm just curious. I've never seen him throw before,\" said third baseman Ryan Zimmerman, a glancer. \"It's exciting. There's just a different kind of buzz here this year.\"\n\nA few hundred yards down Stadium Way, in the home clubhouse at Space Coast Stadium, equipment manager Mike Wallace and his lieutenants are unpacking boxes and hanging up uniforms. Strasburg's name is on an end-of-row locker in the middle of the room. His uniform number, 37, has lived an itinerant, undistinguished life for this franchise, having previously graced the backs of coaches Dave Huppert (2005) and Pat Listach (2009) and pitchers Travis Hughes (2006), Mike Bacsik (2007) and Levale Speigner (2008).\n\nIt is here that Strasburg's professional baseball career will begin, and here where his transition from youth to adulthood, with all its blessings and responsibilities, becomes complete.\n\n\"It's a fun ride,\" Strasburg said Monday morning before his first bullpen session of the spring. \"This is just another part of the journey.\"\n\nIn the past six months, that journey has seen Strasburg sign his name to the largest contract (four years, $15.1 million) ever given to a drafted player, dazzle scouts in the developmental Arizona Fall League, take in marriage the hand of his college sweetheart and leave San Diego to live somewhere else for the first time in his life. When his plane touched down in Orlando Thursday, home was suddenly 3,000 miles away and life was changed forever.\n\n\"I don't know how to explain it, but he's just totally at peace with where everything is in his life,\" said Erik Castro, Strasburg's former teammate at San Diego State and the best man at his wedding. \"He knows he has a lot of blessings in his life, so he's ready to go. This is what he lives for.\"\n\nKathy Swett cried, just a little, at the wedding of her only child. It happened just as her Stephen took the hand of the former Rachelle Lackey, before several hundred friends and family members at a winery outside San Diego, and recited his vows.\n\n\"And then,\" she said, \"I reminded myself there was nothing to cry about because I was actually getting a daughter I never had. And I couldn't have asked for anyone better. I'm a very typical, protective mother. Nobody was ever going to be good enough for my son. But she's great.\"",

The numbers have not improved during Hughes's two-year stint -- and in some cases have gotten worse.\n\nBut Hughes used her close connection with Bush and a strong partnership with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to push through substantial institutional changes at the State Department, win large increases in the budget for public diplomacy, increase cultural exchanges and expand partnerships with American corporations aimed at bolstering the U.S. image overseas, U.S. officials and outside experts said. Hughes also established regional media hubs to deal with the Arab media, and a 24-hour rapid-reaction team that monitored news accounts overseas and recommended messages to counter damaging stories.\n\n\"In the big picture of public diplomacy, our rankings remain very, very low,\" said Edward P. Djerejian, a former ambassador who chaired a congressionally mandated panel in 2003 that recommended overhauling public diplomacy programs. \"Institutionally, I give her high marks.\"\n\nHughes had a rough beginning. The Arab media ridiculed her for statements she made during her maiden voyage to the Middle East in September 2005, which some experts thought indicated a lack of depth in foreign policy.\n\n\"I am a mom, and I love kids,\" Hughes declared in Ankara, Turkey, in September 2005 in an apparent attempt to connect with Muslim audiences. Explaining U.S. goals for Palestinians, she said they were \"to have the experience of having children and families.\"\n\nReviewing her trip, the Arab News said Hughes was \"painfully clueless.\" Al-Jazeera labeled Hughes \"the marquee clown [in] America's circus diplomacy.\"\n\nBut her connection to Bush proved invaluable when it came to fighting bureaucratic wars in Washington. She regularly had lunch or dinner with Bush to update him on her progress -- a level of access highly unusual for a Cabinet secretary, let alone an undersecretary.\n\nFor instance, when Hughes met with top aides to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in October 2005, she shocked them by picking up the phone and calling the White House. She instantly secured a meeting with Bush for the delegation -- a session that normally could take weeks to arrange.\n\nAfter about a year on the job, Hughes scaled back her travel and speechmaking to spend more time on institutional changes, according to someone who worked closely with Hughes. \"I don't remember if it was a deliberate thing, but she realized that the background work was going to be her legacy, along with using her clout to get things done,\" said the official, who was granted anonymity in order to speak candidly.\n\nOnce Hughes's clout became apparent in the State Department, assistant secretaries began to request that her office pitch their ideas to Rice, because she appeared more likely to approve them if they had Hughes's imprimatur.\n\nIn an appearance with Rice at the State Department yesterday, Hughes said she plans to leave office in mid-December and return to \"private life\" in Austin.",

    "text": "We know how you feel, guys. (Photo: PA)\n\nAll is currently quiet on the northern front. The arrival of the Commonwealth Games has created a rare lull in the independence debate. Both sides have retreated to their respective offices, quietly holding lengthy planning meetings and lining up troops for the final push.\n\nBeing in the eye of the storm \u2013 that calm before the maelstrom of claim and counter-claim returns in early August \u2013 it seems an apt moment to take stock of the campaign. In particular, one depressing truth largely overlooked deserves proper attention \u2013 Scottish voters are utterly disillusioned with the state of the debate.\n\nBefore diving into the figures, consider what both sides agree about the momentousness of September 18. This is the most important decision Scots have made for three centuries. The public is engaged in politics like never before, with a record-breaking turnout of 80 per cent looking likely. A historic expansion of the ballot has given 16- and 17-year-olds a say on their nation's future for the first time ever.\n\nListen to that rhetoric and you'd be forgiven for thinking the campaign has embodied the highest ideals of British democracy. It is an appealing thought. But dig a little deeper and you find a Scottish electorate that feels starved of facts, lied to by politicians and completely disengaged.\n\nTake information. It's three years since Alex Salmond won the majority that made the referendum a reality and almost two since both sides formalised the vote in the Edinburgh Agreement.\n\nSince then the SNP has produced a 650-page White Paper \u2013 the \"most comprehensive blueprint for an independent country ever published\" \u2013 and Westminster has released more than 1,000 pages of analysis. There have been debates, rallies, nationwide door knocks, poster campaigns, leaflets and new TV programmes launched to inform the public.\n\nAnd where do things stand, after all that? Half of Scots \u2013 53 per cent to be precise, according to a revealing TNS survey in June \u2013 feel they haven't got enough knowledge to decide how to vote. The other stats in that poll make for equally sorry reading.\n\nTake trust. The economy is the most important referendum issue for voters. Rows about currency, growth, benefits and taxes have dominated. Both campaigns even produced the exact economic benefit of their respective sides with a \"ta-da\" flourish back in May. (Every Scot would be \u00a31,400 better off a year in the UK, and \u00a31,000 better off out of the UK, apparently.)\n\nSo which side makes the most accurate economic predictions? 25 per cent of voters said the Scottish Government, 18 per cent said the UK. But another option got far more support \u2013 neither, at 45 per cent. Put another way, almost half of Scots believe they can't trust what either side says about the most important issue in the referendum.\n\nViews on tone paint a similar picture. One in two Scots think Better Together has been more negative than positive. One in three say the same about Yes Scotland. Almost three in four think it's hard to know who to believe because both make differing claims.\n\nAdd all that together, and you get a real sense of the damage this disillusionment is having. 63 per cent have \"given up listening to the debate as both sides just contradict each other\". 63 per cent. Almost two in three.\n\nIt has been said that the UK should be proud a vote on independence is taking place without violence or bloodshed. We should. But is that enough? Next time the importance of the vote is mentioned, consider what the above actually means.\n\nWith just a few months left before this \"historic\" vote, Scots feel robbed of the essential facts they need to decide. They feel lied to by both campaigns about the issue they care about most, the economy. And they feel so sick to the teeth of the way independence is being debated that they've just stopped listening.\n\nFor that, everyone involved \u2013 politicians, campaigners and, yes, journalists too \u2013 should feel pretty ashamed.\n\n\u2022 Get the latest comment and analysis from the Telegraph\n\n\u2022 Read more from our news and politics bloggers",

I wasn't even sure I was capable of learning anymore,\" he said. \"I really like the responsibilities of flying. I like the places you go, the people you meet, the views you see ... It's where I feel engaged and comfortable and free. It's become a big part of my life.\"\n\nThough he didn't earn his pilot's license until he was 54, the actor best known for playing Indiana Jones and Han Solo liked the idea of mastering something so \"complicated and difficult\" as going airborne.\n\n\"I was so identified with what I did for a living, and I enjoy it, have respect for it, and love the freedom and responsibility that acting provides,\" he told\n\nmagazine in 1999. \"However, flying gave me the opportunity to create an identity other than Harrison Ford, the actor.\"\n\nFear never seemed to be an issue for the father of five \u2013 especially since\n\nin the skies on two previous occasions before\n\non a Los Angeles golf course on Thursday.\n\nIn 1999, Ford crashed his helicopter in a dry lake bed north of Los Angeles when the motor failed. \"There was a mechanical failure while we were practicing power recovery autorotations,\" he told\n\nin 2008. \"It was more or less\n\n. Luckily, I was with another\n\nand neither of us was hurt ... and both of us are still flying.\"\n\nThe next year, a wind shear damaged his six-passenger Beech Bonanza and forced him to land in Lincoln, Nebraska. Local reports blamed the emergency landing on a wind gust, which Ford was quick to dispel. \"To simply say that a wind gust had blown me off the runway is to misunderstand the techniques of landing. This was a wind shear, where the wind totally comes from another direction.\"\n\nNeither incident took the wind out of Ford's sails. And his wife, actress\n\n, and their son Liam, now 14, learned to share his passion.\n\n\"Calista loves to fly and I'm thrilled because it's so important to me and it's the kind of thing that's so much more fun with somebody who really enjoys it,\" Ford told PEOPLE in 2003. \"Liam loves to fly. Calista likes the process, she likes what she sees from the air, she likes seeing me happy. I think a lot of it has to do with that she loves to see me doing something that I love.\"\n\nFord's experience no doubt contributed to what one witness described as a \"beautifully executed forced landing\" on Penmar Golf Course Thursday.\n\n\"It's not a crash,\" explained Christian Fry, vice president of the Santa Monica Airport Association, to PEOPLE. \"It appears that they had some sort of engine trouble during takeoff, which happens from time to time with airplane, but when that occurs, the beauty of Santa Monica Airport is we have the golf course, which runs parallel to our main runway. So, engine trouble, they appeared to have made a turn back towards the airport and didn't have enough speed to make it to the runway, so he made a beautifully executed forced landing here at the golf course, so really just a great job by a very well-trained pilot.\"\n\nFord has been eager to share his passion with others, especially youth.

In an interview with WSJ Executive Washington Editor Jerry Seib, Mr. Emanuel also defended President Obama's job creation strategy in the face of lagging job growth.\n\nThat discussion is part of a broader effort to improve strained White House relations with the business community. Of those relations, Mr. Emanuel said: \"Personally, stepping back, I think there are misunderstandings. I don't think it is a binary as reported. It's more complicated in ways than have been reported.\"\n\nOn other topics during the conversation, Mr. Emanuel said:\n\nOn the administration's broader relationship with the business community, Mr. Emanuel acknowledged the widespread perception that ties have grown increasingly strained. \"I know there is this story out there,\" he said. \"But a number of individuals, as well as top CEOs in the country, admire what the president has done and understand the context in which he inherited a very deep recession, a huge credit crunch.\"\n\nMr. Emanuel asserted that White House actions have, in particular, put both financial markets and the auto industry on significantly stronger footing, and that business leaders should appreciate the president's willingness to confront teachers unions over education-reform plans.\n\nHe also said that he believes most of the business community's concerns arise from worries about the administration's regulatory policies, an area where Mr. Obama is listening to concerns. Still, he added, business leaders won't always be happy with the outcome.\n\n\"The president's view is we've had a lot of reviews of these, but he's open to hearing what they have to say,\" Mr. Emanuel said. \"That said, we're not going to go back to a system where an industry writes the regulations and an industry has a regulator coming out of the industry to regulate the industry. They are very important voices, but they are one seat at the table.\"\n\nAs that answer suggests, the administration is trapped between two powerful forces in crafting its relationship with the business community in the aftermath of a bruising recession. While business leaders complain with increasing frequency that the administration is hostile or indifferent to their concerns, liberals in the president's Democratic party frequently complain that the administration actually is too cozy with various business interests.\n\nOn job creation, Mr. Emanuel said the president held a session with top economic advisers this week to consider new initiatives to create jobs at a time when employment numbers have remained stubbornly low, and a significant political problem for the administration. One of the administration's hurdles, though, is a reluctance in Congress, particularly among Republicans but also among some Democrats, to spend more taxpayer money on stimulus programs amid public doubts about stimulus' usefulness and mounting concern about deficits.\n\nIn response to those concerns, Mr. Emanuel said the initiative to pump new money into building infrastructure could be financed by redirecting already-appropriated funds into \"a more productive use.\" He didn't elaborate.\n\nWrite to Gerald F.

    "text": "With at least 20% of Afghanistan still in the hands of a resurgent Taliban, the longest war in American history is far from over. Last week, President Barack Obama announced he would prolong the nation\u2019s presence into the country well into 2017 with 8,400 troops expected to remain by the time he leaves office.\n\nThe news didn\u2019t make front pages, but for Andrew Quilty, who\u2019s been photographing the conflict from Kabul for the past three years, the world\u2019s attention is essential. \u201cDespite arguably good intentions, the 14-year international intervention in Afghanistan has been largely disastrous for all involved,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cThe international community shouldn\u2019t be allowed to just walk away and forget Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nQuilty, who hails from Australia, one of the many countries that joined Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001, feels \u201csomewhat responsible,\u201d he says, for pushing out information to the world. In recent weeks, he\u2019s visited some of Afghanistan\u2019s more unstable regions, including Helmand.\n\nAhead of a retrospective of his work from Afghanistan that will go on show at the Visa pour l\u2019Image festival [the exhibition is curated by the writer of this article] in September, Quilty explains why he\u2019s committed to this story.\n\nOlivier Laurent: Why go back to Helmand considering the security situation?\n\nAndrew Quilty: In Afghanistan, come spring, attention invariably turns to the south; particularly Helmand \u2014 one of the Taliban\u2019s firmest strongholds. That being the case it\u2019s no coincidence that Helmand is also home to the world\u2019s largest opium crop, the lucrative harvest of which comes during April each year. Following the harvest comes the Taliban\u2019s inevitable \u201cspring offensive\u201d and the ensuing fighting season. The timing is isn\u2019t arbitrary. It coincides with the thick vegetation afforded by spring, and a freshly bulging war-chest.\n\nThe first two times I visited this Spring were spent with writer colleagues (also my housemates in Kabul) traveling to several frontlines within an hour or two of Lashkar Gah, Helmand\u2019s capital. With attrition and desertion rates as high as 30% among Afghan security forces, we wanted to see what life was really like for the soldiers manning these frontlines in the country\u2019s most hotly contested province. Secondly, we wanted to gauge how vulnerable Lashkar Gah was. After a major Taliban offensive in December 2015 that had government forces fighting from the city gates, many were predicting its fall come spring.\n\nIt was during these trips that I was struck by just how close some of the frontlines were to the capital, and how regularly fighting would erupt. While few military commanders would allow us to stay overnight (when most of the fighting occurs), from the hotel dining room (where we\u2019re often the only guests) we\u2019d see tracer rounds arc above the horizon and hear the thump of artillery and mortars from areas we\u2019d been hours earlier, sometimes less than a half hour drive away. Yet \u2014 at least on the surface \u2014 Lashkar Gah\u2019s residents appeared to be oblivious.\n\nI think it\u2019s a common misconception about war zones \u2014 that all there is is war. In Lashkar Gah, while the war has harmed the economy \u2014 resulting in an uptick in crime \u2014 and a generally diminished quality of life, bakeries still open before dawn, children continue going to school and boys play sports on dusty fields each afternoon. Even with the war on its doorstep, as clich\u00e9d as it sounds, life goes on.\n\nBut it\u2019s not quite as simple as that.\n\nOlivier Laurent: What\u2019s the situation there? Why is it important to document what\u2019s happening in Afghanistan in general and Helmand in particular?\n\nAndrew Quilty: Like much of the country, Helmand is becoming increasingly risky to travel to, especially outside the provincial capital. This, combined with the gradual decrease in interest in Afghanistan, means that very few journalists are traveling outside Kabul, to places like Helmand, even compared to one or two years ago. There are a number of reasons for this, but the main one, I believe, is that news organizations rarely think the demand for information from these places justifies the risk of commissioning reporting anymore.\n\nOn the one hand, I understand that the proximity/empathy scale that news organizations work off no longer warrants the risks that, in the case of Afghanistan, were routinely taken when over 100,000 American soldiers were here. On the other hand, having been in Afghanistan a few years now, I feel somewhat responsible for pushing out information so that the international community doesn\u2019t forget about it. Despite arguably good intentions, the 14-year international intervention in Afghanistan has been largely disastrous for all involved. The international community shouldn\u2019t be allowed to just walk away and forget Afghanistan.\n\nWhy Helmand though? From an international audience\u2019s perspective: since 2001, Helmand has been a major epicenter of the war. More international soldiers were killed there than anywhere else in the country. It was the breeding ground for the insurgency, and now, the majority of the province is either controlled or contested by the Taliban. Helmand is symbolic of the failure of the international combat mission, anti-narcotics and anti-corruption initiatives, counter-insurgency strategy and international development projects.\n\nFrom a domestic perspective, Helmand represents the conservative, ethnic Pashtun heartland and the Taliban\u2019s support base. It symbolizes successive national governments\u2019 inability to thwart corruption and to reconcile ideological differences between the tribes, factions and long-established patronage networks.\n\nOlivier Laurent: Your photos show a sort of parallel state of affairs, where war seems to have become a normal part of life.\n\nAndrew Quilty: It\u2019s true, Helmandis are inured to war. There\u2019d be very few who have experienced sustained peace in their lifetimes. That\u2019s not to say they accept it; it\u2019s more like they\u2019re resigned to it. I get the sense that the people in Helmand are exhausted by war. It\u2019s a constant. Nowadays, not even the winter months bring respite from the fighting the way it did a few years ago.\n\nAnd yes, you see the war\u2019s effect on what should be normal life. In a dilapidated amusement park by the Helmand River, I watched a young man climbing the outer struts of a long-neglected ferris wheel. His weight was enough to give two young boys a quarter revolution in one of the gondolas. Another man approached and lamented how the ferris wheel would never turn of its own accord again; investment, even in the capital, he said, had all but ceased. There was too much risk that infrastructure would be destroyed in the event that Lashkar Gah was overrun by the Taliban, as had happened only months before in Kunduz, in the north of the country.\n\nOlivier Laurent: You\u2019ve committed a lot of the last few years to Afghanistan. Why?\n\nAndrew Quilty: It\u2019s hard to put a finger on what keeps me here. It can be an incredibly frustrating and difficult place to work and live. As a photographer, it\u2019s the best and the worst country I\u2019ve ever tried to photograph because you have to let so many things you see \u2014 often from a car window \u2014 go by, because, for one reason or another, it\u2019s not safe to stop and be seen. Similarly it\u2019s often not advisable to be out at dusk or after dark, which means driving through the beautiful \u201cgolden hours\u201d to get home rather than working amidst them, which has always been one of my favorite parts of the job. Furthermore, there are cultural impediments to photographing women, half the country is too dangerous to even contemplate accessing, and perhaps most frustratingly, documenting the other side of the conflict \u2014 the Taliban side \u2014 is almost entirely out of the question as a foreigner.\n\nRead next: The Story Behind the Haunting Photo of a Starving Afghan Boy\n\nI suppose that says a lot about the reasons for committing to Afghanistan. It really comes down to the fact that I\u2019ve found immense meaning and purpose in what I\u2019ve been able to do here. It\u2019s hard to point a camera in any direction without it coming upon a scene that has depth beyond the physical and the aesthetic, which I now feel, is much of what my earlier work was about. Having said that, I do find Afghanistan absurdly photogenic as well, and so combining these two elements makes for an undeniably compelling environment for a photojournalist.\n\nFinally, and this is something that has begun to weigh heavily in recent weeks \u2014 particularly after the death of David Gilkey \u2014 there is a sense of responsibility to stick-it-out as interest in Afghanistan wanes. Having said that, and even considering that the country is becoming increasingly difficult to work in, it\u2019d be hypocritical for me not to have to seriously wrestle with the prospect of leaving, if and when the time comes.\n\nAndrew Quilty is an Australian photographer based in Kabul. His show, After Enduring Freedom, will go on show at the Visa pour l\u2019Image photojournalism festival in Perpignan, France, from Aug. 27 to Sept. 11, 2016.\n\nOlivier Laurent is the editor of TIME LightBox.

Nikki Haley and talk show host Rush Limbaugh. The Wall Street Journal wrote a scathing editorial, saying Gingrich undermined the GOP majority in the House by attacking Ryan's plan to rein in entitlement spending.\n\nRyan's proposal for Medicare, contained in a 2012 budget adopted by the GOP-led House, would convert the health insurance program for seniors into vouchers and affect people now under the age of 55. It has been widely derided by President Obama and Democrats.\n\nIn the Fox interview, Gingrich said an 18-year-old video clip of him supporting a mandate that individuals carry health insurance -- the heart of the federal health care law signed by President Obama that Republicans want to repeal -- has been taken out of context. At the time, Gingrich explained, he was espousing the GOP position in response to the Clinton administration's health care proposal.\n\n\"I do not support a mandate,\" he said Tuesday. \"I am opposed to Obamacare\" and have been for the past two years.\n\nBut Gingrich refused to comment on a Politico report that he owed up to $500,000 to luxury jeweler Tiffany's, saying he won't engage in \"trivial pursuit.\"\n\n\"If it doesn't relate to a better future for America ... from here on out, I'm not going to comment on it,\" he said.\n\nWhether Gingrich's efforts to reset his one-week-old presidential campaign remains to be seen. Headlines today in Politico, for example, say \"Newt Gingrich campaign fights for its life.\" In The Washington Post, the story is about Gingrich's \"bumpy start\" to the presidential campaign.\n\nThe New York Times asks \"Can Newt Gingrich Control Newt Gingrich?\" in a piece reviewing the ex-speaker's self-described \"great weakness\" for getting into trouble for what he says.\n\nGingrich spokesman Rick Tyler dismissed the negative headlines, blaming the \"political elite\" and the news media. \"The literati sent out their minions to do their bidding,\" Tyler wrote in a missive to The Huffington Post. \"Washington cannot tolerate threats from outsiders who might disrupt their comfortable world.\"",

    "text": "The first edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which dates to 1768.\n\nEditor's note: James S. O'Rourke, IV is a professor of management and the Arthur F. and Mary J. O'Neil Director of the Fanning Center for Business Communication at the University of Notre Dame.\n\n(CNN) -- The world received word yesterday that the publishers of Encyclopedia Britannica would stop producing hardbound, paper copies of their venerable reference.\n\nActually, they stopped in 2010 but didn't tell anyone. Now they've disclosed they've been able to sell just 8,000 copies of the collection. The rest are in a warehouse in Chicago, looking for someone who needs historically accurate, out-of-date information.\n\nAccording to the company, they'll continue publishing online and will sell their services to individuals, schools and libraries. In some respects, that's good. The Web is much more easily updated, more interactive, and can deliver motion, sound, and color simultaneously. In other respects, that's not good, particularly for young readers, older folks, immigrants, and technophobes who'd rather read a book.\n\nBritannica's decision is, in so many ways, simply a mile marker along the way to the new world of the 21st century. In mid-20th century America, a set of Britannicas on the shelf was a status symbol: a sign that the family had money, taste, some pretense to intellect, or at least a very strong desire to be seen that way.\n\nOther families had the World Book, Colliers, or the Encyclopedia Americana (my own family's choice). Annual yearbooks updated entries in science, technology, industrial manufacturing, botany, and more. And, for so many of us who grew up in the 20th century, it was fun just to look through those volumes, read, and wonder about the world.\n\nWikipedia has largely replaced those printed volumes, principally because it's free. Everything on the Web is free (or should be, according to its most passionate users). The fact that it's not written, edited, or monitored by content matter experts seems to be of little concern. Crowd-sourcing has replaced experts and, though not good, the accuracy quotient of Wikipedia articles seems to be improving.\n\nThis is, however, part of a trend that assumes expertise is overvalued. Today, most technology users value connectivity and experience. Newspapers and magazines are in decline, bloggers and content aggregators are on the ascendant. The problem with crowd-sourcing the answer to any particular question is, of course, that you're as likely to find ideologically driven opinion as hard fact. You also have little in the way of support for judgments about credibility, reliability, and accuracy.\n\nOurs is a society that cannot afford to do without a postal service, daily newspapers, and expertly edited sources of public knowledge. The notion that all knowledge is available online within six clicks is both exciting and a bit frightening (have you Googled yourself, your friends, or your children to see what's online, including images?).\n\nThe disappearance of our printed sources of information poses two serious concerns. First, our antiquated, overtaxed, patchwork power grid is perennially on the verge of collapse. Chinese hackers, aging components, or an F4 tornado could take down large segments of our power supply. No power, no Internet.\n\nSecond, just two-thirds of all Americans have access to the Internet at work or home. Those of us who live with an iPhone, Blackberry, tablet device (or a desktop computer) seem to think just about everyone is connected. Not so. Online access is far from a given for lower-income people. Wireless handheld devices and municipal WiFi systems look promising, but more than 100 million Americans are not connected to the Internet, according to the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project.\n\nClearly this is a hinge point in history, much like Gutenberg's use of moveable type to operate a printing press, or Marconi's use of wireless communication to transmit the human voice over vast distances. The arrival of video scanning -- which made digital optics possible -- and high-speed data processing have accelerated the rate of change and we're simply going to have to live with it and make the best of it.\n\nIn the interim, we could think about buying a book or subscribing to a newspaper (just for old time's sake), or we could do something important for that one-third of our neighbors that will serve as an information safety net: Support your local public library. They, too, offer access to the Internet, but they also offer a clean, safe, nicely organized source for each of us to find information that's useful, valuable, interesting, and helpful.\n\nLooking forward to the world our children and their children will live in doesn't mean simply abandoning technology that seems anachronistic. It means preserving the best of what we know and making it accessible to everyone.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @CNNOpinion\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James S. O'Rourke, IV.",

She died in September and a ceremony was held to welcome the arrival of four mighty Tucksons to the Art Gallery of NSW on Monday.\n\nAfter a lifetime dedicated to her husband\u2019s work, Margaret Tuckson has made sure the best of his paintings become public property. The National Gallery in Canberra will receive six, the Queensland gallery four, the South Australian gallery five, and the National Gallery of Victoria three.\n\nGreat artists in Australia leave great widows. Wendy Whiteley is only a beginner after 22 years service to Brett. Lyn Williams is still going strong after 32 years at the helm of her husband Fred\u2019s estate. But Margaret Tuckson was the senior widow of them all, the doyenne, the great flame-keeper for 41 years.\n\nFor many of those years, a cache of drawings and paintings would make the long journey down from Wahroonga on Sydney\u2019s north shore for another Tuckson show at Watters gallery. And at every opening night, Margaret would manage somehow not to take centre stage. She cut a tall, gawky figure, always amused and feigning surprise that Tony\u2019s work continued to command such attention.\n\nShe was a potter and a scholar of pottery herself. With Patricia May she wrote The Traditional Pottery of Papua and New Guinea, the classic reference work in that field. She was admired for her pluck, her enthusiasms, her expeditions to the Tiwi Islands and New Guinea and for living with an often difficult man who spent all his time painting pictures hardly anyone ever saw.\n\nMost shows included paintings of her stark naked. She was the least likely life model but no other woman of the upper north shore has ever had her private parts so brutally exposed as Margaret Tuckson.\n\nShe was a child of Warrawee and the empire. Her parents were no ordinary British migrants. Her father OD Bisset was a famous letter writer to the Sydney Morning Herald, perhaps the most published in the history of the paper, lecturing Sydney for decades on manners, values and politics.\n\nThe Bissets had settled in a huge spread with palms and a tennis court that Margaret was still rolling with a great iron roller in her old age. She met her husband in that house when her parents invited a few stray British airmen to her 21st birthday.\n\nThe north shore was not entirely hostile to great painters. Margaret Preston had put Berowra on the map. Grace Cossington Smith still lived around the corner from the Bissets, endlessly painting her bedroom. But they had trouble up there coming to grips with abstract expressionism.\n\nAt breakfast when I was about 10, my mother roared with laughter and said: \u201cYou will never guess what Tony is doing now. He is pasting his Craven A packets onto his paintings.\u201d That picture has just arrived at the National Gallery in Canberra, one of the great gifts in Margaret\u2019s will.\n\nThose Craven A cigarettes felled Tony Tuckson at the age of 52, just as his immense talent was being recognised. His widow was left with a son Michael, her friends, her pottery and her writing, a faithful border collie, a beautiful house built dangerously deep in the bush and a great stockpile of Tony\u2019s paintings.\n\nWhen fire threatened the house in the mid-1990s, Edmund Capon, the director of the Art Gallery of NSW, sent a truck with orders to fill it up. After that, Margaret lent paintings to her friends for safekeeping. Now there are gaps on walls all over Sydney as the trucks take the pictures to Canberra, to Brisbane, to Melbourne and Adelaide.",

    "text": "Forget the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary. One of the more intense and dogged campaigns is currently being waged by Bank of America to convince shareholders that Brian T. Moynihan should keep his job as both chairman and chief executive.\n\nTop bank executives and one of its board members have pounded the pavement from London to Houston, lobbying dozens of investors. They cut a deal to mollify one outspoken critic, and they enlisted the help of the former Massachusetts congressman Barney Frank, an architect of Wall Street\u2019s regulatory overhaul. Mr. Frank said he agreed to make the case for Mr. Moynihan after discussing the issue with his neighbor, an executive at Bank of America, the nation\u2019s second-largest bank.\n\nThe battle engulfing the bank has had, at times, the feel of a local City Council race. It has featured a cast of characters including a Roman Catholic priest, Warren E. Buffett and two giant California pension funds that have mounted an aggressive countercampaign to strip Mr. Moynihan of his chairmanship.\n\nAs many as 40 percent of shareholders were expected to vote against Mr. Moynihan from the outset, leaving about 60 percent up for grabs \u2014 a huge group that includes major money management firms like T. Rowe Price and BlackRock.\n\nThat the vote, scheduled for Tuesday in Charlotte, N.C., has proved so contentious shows the depths of discontent with Bank of America, mostly over how the bank\u2019s board decided to give Mr. Moynihan both titles in the first place. It did so unilaterally last year, overturning a previous shareholder vote in 2009 that required the bank to have a separate chairman and chief executive.\n\nBut the battle also illustrates how the byzantine world of corporate governance can consume the time and attention of a company\u2019s leadership.\n\nBank officials say Mr. Moynihan, chief executive since 2010, earned the right to also become chairman last year, having steered the company through a near-death experience after its costly acquisition of Countrywide Financial in 2008 and Merrill Lynch in 2009. They say there is no conclusive evidence that companies with separate chief executives and chairmen perform better than those that don\u2019t divide the roles.\n\nThe two pension funds leading the charge against the bank \u2014 the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System \u2014 argue that an independent chairman would provide better oversight of a bank with a troubled history.\n\n\u201cSince Mr. Moynihan\u2019s appointment as C.E.O. in January 2010, the company has continued to underperform, has failed important Fed stress tests, and has perpetuated a subpar engagement with its shareholders,\u201d the California pension funds wrote in a joint letter to the bank\u2019s lead independent director last month. \u201cGiven these missteps, we do not believe now is the time to reduce oversight of management by combining the roles of C.E.O. and chair.\u201d\n\nThe pension funds\u2019 sway goes beyond their less than 1 percent ownership of the bank\u2019s shares. They have been calling and writing to the largest shareholders \u2014 including some firms they may pay to manage money on behalf of the California pensioners \u2014 urging them to vote against the combined role.\n\nFor some shareholders, the C.E.O.-chairman vote is more of an incidental bargaining chip. When the issue came up in 2009, for example, union groups that supported separating the roles were also pushing behind the scenes for the right to organize Bank of America employees, according to people briefed on the matter.\n\nIf anything, the current contest \u2014 which has reached a fever pitch this week \u2014 has been an unwelcome distraction for Bank of America just as it had put most of its legal and regulatory troubles behind it.\n\nIn 2013, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive and chairman, Jamie Dimon, faced a similar vote, which had been stoked by the bank\u2019s embarrassing trading loss, known as the London whale. Mr. Dimon prevailed.\n\nBank of America\u2019s campaign is being run by its general counsel, Gary G. Lynch, and its head of global marketing, Anne M. Finucane, who has labored for years to burnish Mr. Moynihan\u2019s image as a banker willing to work with regulators and community groups to right the wrongs of the financial crisis.\n\nThat image was dimmed by the board\u2019s decision last October to overturn a bylaw that required the bank to keep its chairman and chief executive roles separate. The board argued that like most big American companies, Bank of America should have the ability to decide whether to grant its top executive one or both titles.\n\nStill, some shareholders and others were outraged. Sensing his moment, the Rev. Seamus Finn proposed putting the issue to a vote at the bank\u2019s annual meeting in May.\n\nFather Finn, a Catholic priest who advises church groups on investment issues and is chairman of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, said the leadership question was not his primary concern, but he figured that a proposal to split the role would probably get him a meeting with the bank\u2019s top leadership.\n\nIt worked. Bank of America agreed to give Father Finn what he really wanted \u2014 a report detailing what went wrong at Bank of America during the mortgage crisis. And in return, Father Finn said he agreed to dropped his proposal to divide the top positions.\n\nEven though the issue did not make it on the ballot at the annual meeting, the proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis urged the bank\u2019s shareholders to vote against members of the board\u2019s corporate governance committee because of the unilateral decision to combine the titles.\n\nAcknowledging the extent of the shareholders\u2019 displeasure, the bank decided to put the issue to a special vote and started campaigning.\n\nA major player in the effort is the bank\u2019s lead independent director, Jack O. Bovender Jr., a former health care executive and Duke University trustee. Described by a bank colleague as the consummate Southern gentleman, Mr. Bovender has been making the rounds of investors, explaining why the board moved to make Mr. Moynihan both chairman and chief executive.\n\nMr. Bovender has not been able to win over everyone, though. In a conversation last month, he told Institutional Shareholder Services how he agreed to take a leadership role at the bank only if no other board member wanted to step in.\n\nMr. Bovender was speaking \u201ctongue in cheek,\u201d a person briefed on the matter said. But apparently the proxy advisory firm did not see it that way, calling his anecdote \u201cparticularly telling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile shareholders should be glad that Bovender stepped into this leadership vacuum by accepting the lead director role,\u201d it wrote in its report, \u201cit calls into question the board\u2019s acceptance of an individual without relevant industry experience.\u201d\n\nWith I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommending that the jobs of chief executive and chairman be separated, the bank most likely lost as much as 30 percent of the vote because certain shareholders vote automatically with the proxy firms, people briefed on the matter said.\n\nIn trying to win over other investors, the bank has had to navigate somewhat unfamiliar territory. Each large investor approaches these votes differently. Some firms consider the opinions of their portfolio managers and analysts, who recommend whether to buy the bank\u2019s shares. Others allow only their corporate governance committees to weigh in.\n\nBank of America cannot even lobby its largest shareholder, BlackRock, directly. Because BlackRock is partly owned by another bank, PNC Financial Services, the giant asset manager has to outsource its vote to an independent fiduciary so as not to run afoul of the Bank Holding Company Act.\n\nA BlackRock spokesman declined to name the outside fiduciary, citing \u201ccompany policy.\u201d\n\nLast week, Bank of America got help from Mr. Buffett, who said in a television interview that Mr. Moynihan deserved both titles.\n\nThen, Mr. Frank voiced support for the combined roles, calling Mr. Moynihan \u201cone of the more constructive\u201d bank leaders in helping shape recent financial regulation.\n\nMr. Frank is not a Bank of America shareholder. But his endorsement could persuade some unions or progressive-minded investors to break from the California funds and back the bank\u2019s position.\n\nMr. Frank said he volunteered to speak publicly after discussing it with his neighbor in Newton, a Boston suburb, who works for the bank in communications and public policy. Mr. Frank, who recently joined the board of Signature Bank, a small commercial bank in New York, said the most important oversight of financial companies comes not from its directors but from regulators.\n\n\u201cPeople expect too much of boards,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "03/03/2016 AT 11:30 AM EST\n\nThe debilitating disease of Parkinson's may have \"diminished him,\" but a friend of\n\nsays the boxing legend has never stopped fighting.\n\nThe sports icon is largely\n\n85 to 90 percent of the time, his friend Davis Miller tells PEOPLE, but he \"still plays with kids even in a wheelchair. He lights up around kids.\"\n\n\"He's 74 and in late stages of Parkinson's and still fights every day and all day long. There's a magic about Muhammad Ali \u2013 everything from his elegance in the ring to his sense of humor, which has a childlike quality to it. He connects with the child in us too.\"\n\nAli's extraordinary life is at the center of a new exhibit at London's O2 arena,\n\n, opening on Friday. The exhibit features more than 100 artifacts and previously unseen footage and was partly curated by Miller, who is also the author of the new book\n\n, which tells his own intimate story of knowing the boxer for more than 30 years.\n\nmagazine covers and boxing belts, there's a signed half-length cotton robe embroidered on the back with Ali's legendary statement, \"Float Like A Butterfly, Sting Like A Bee.\" It was worn by his cornerman Bundini Brown at the famed \"Rumble in the Jungle\" fight against George Foreman in 1974.\n\nPoignantly, in London where it became famous, there is also the \"split-glove\" that Ali wore, and broke, during his 1963 fight against Briton Henry Cooper at Wembley. Boxing legend has it that attending to the split meant that Ali had a little bit more time at the break to recover. He came out for the fifth round and won the contest.\n\n\"It's one of the three most famous artifacts in Muhammad Ali's life, and probably the most famous pair of boxing gloves too,\" says Miller.\n\n\"The Brits have a particular affinity for Ali and he has also for the Brits. He has had a very long relationship with the British people going back to the first fight in 1963 here against Henry Cooper, right up to the present day.\"\n\nThere is a growing campaign, backed by British heavyweight David Haye for the star to be given an honorary knighthood. There are more than 20,000 signatures gathered so far on a petition.\n\nAlthough he faced backlash in the U.S. for his stance on the Vietnam War, \"the British didn't see it that way,\" says Miller. \"The rest of the world came to love him and he became a hero.\"\n\nIn interviews and through his well-known quips and often forthright views, he \"speaks with quickness and wit and cleverness,\" says Miller. \"He stood up, and continues to stand up, for what he believed to be right.\"\n\n.

    "text": "In the season that gave us Ryan Fitzpatrick\u2019s countless interceptions, the sudden decline of Carson Palmer and the likely \u2014 and disastrous \u2014 end of the Jay Cutler era with the Bears, Brock Osweiler \u2014 the Texans\u2019 $72 million prize \u2014 might be the NFL\u2019s most disappointing quarterback.\n\nOsweiler\u2019s season has been defined by accuracy issues (59.5 completion percentage) and a tendency for turnovers (13 interceptions, three of them coming this week against the Chargers). But with three years and $51 million left on his deal \u2014 including guaranteed money through 2017 \u2014 the Texans appear stuck with Osweiler for the immediate future.\n\nSome in the football world believe Osweiler to be an inherently flawed quarterback, who won\u2019t improve as he adds to his 18 career starts.\n\nMerril Hoge, a former NFL running back and current ESPN analyst, pointed to a number of mechanical issues as the root of Osweiler\u2019s struggles.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not really gifted, not fleet of foot,\u201d Hoge told The Post. \u201cHe\u2019s not smooth in the pocket. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of quickness, he\u2019s not subtle. He\u2019s very elongated, he\u2019s jerky, he gets off balance, and it\u2019s hard for him to throw. It\u2019s hard for him to get his feet back under him when he throws on the move, and oftentimes he makes bad throws.\u201d\n\nThese issues might even be exacerbated by something entirely out of his control \u2014 and something traditionally thought to be an advantage for quarterbacks. Osweiler is listed at 6-foot-8, and is easily the tallest starting quarterback in the NFL (and the tallest to be drafted in the league\u2019s history). It allows one to more fully see the field and takes some guesswork out of throwing to receivers. It\u2019s also why 6-footers Drew Brees and Russell Wilson are considered \u201cshort\u201d quarterbacks.\n\n\u201c[Height] helps you a great deal,\u201d Gil Brandt, a former talent scout and executive for the Rams and Cowboys, who now works for SiriusXM Radio, told The Post.\n\n\u201cWhen you have height, you can see the field. When you see the field, you have a better chance to succeed.\u201d\n\nBut at extreme heights, the advantage may start to deteriorate.\n\n\u201cAt his height, it\u2019s much easier to identify where the ball is going, where he wants to go with the football,\u201d Hoge said. \u201cWith Russell Wilson or Drew Brees, or even a Matthew Stafford, they\u2019re not extraordinarily tall, and you can\u2019t see their eyes as well.\n\n\u201cSitting in that pocket, they can see fine, but their eyes do get lost to the defender. It\u2019s like a smaller running back. Darren Sproles, he gets lost behind blockers, it\u2019s hard to locate him. This is the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefensive guys have said they can see his eyes. Clearly. He stares things down,\u201d Hoge added.\n\nOsweiler signed with the Texans this offseason after passing on a return to the Broncos, the team that drafted him in 2012, then kept him as Peyton Manning\u2019s understudy till last season. That\u2019s when he replaced an ineffective and injured Manning in Week 10 before being benched in Week 16 for Manning, who then did just enough to let the defense carry the Broncos to a Super Bowl.\n\nIt was seen as Osweiler spurning the Broncos, but it seems clear now why team president John Elway was hesitant to throw the same money at Osweiler that the Texans did.\n\nSome still believe Osweiler, who ranks 25th in total QBR and runs an offense ranked 31st in the league, has the potential to succeed in the NFL. Brandt maintains that the fifth-year quarterback was a \u201cwise investment\u201d who \u201chas everything you need to be a good quarterback.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has a live arm, he can deliver the ball in rhythm down the field, and he can throw darts to short and intermediate stationary targets,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cWhen you look at their struggles, [WR Will] Fuller has a lot of drops, their offensive line is not great. I think he\u2019s going to get better.\u201d\n\nBrandt, who was the Cowboys\u2019 primary talent scout during a stretch of 20 straight winning seasons from 1966 to 1985, sees Osweiler\u2019s flaws as correctable.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at Tom Brady, his accuracy is off the charts, and he can throw just as well at a moving target as a stationary target,\u201d Brandt said.\n\n\u201cOsweiler throws the ball much better to a stationary target. When a guy runs a hook route, he\u2019ll probably hit him better than when a guy runs a crossing route.\n\n\u201cBut I think [Texans coach Bill] O\u2019Brien can correct that in the offseason. He\u2019ll do a great job with him, just as he did with Christian Hackenberg at Penn State.\u201d\n\nHoge also offered a solution on how Osweiler can turn his predictability into a weapon.\n\n\u201cHe stares things down, and that\u2019s where he can get better. He can use that to his advantage, and manipulate defenders. He can be smarter with his eyes, and not give things away,\u201d Hoge said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a reputation for that, so he can stare down somebody he\u2019s not throwing to. Snap his butt around and throw a post, throw a dig. That\u2019s how he can really use his height to his advantage.\u201d\n\nOsweiler has another full season to figure things out before the Texans can realistically cut bait on him, as his $37 million of guaranteed money comes off the books after 2017. He also plays in the AFC South, a division seemingly no team wants to win (Houston is in first place with a -42 point differential).\n\nBut he has a long way to go to prove he deserves his contract.\n\n\u201cIs he worth the kind of money they gave him? As it pertains to today, no, they probably overpaid,\u201d Brandt said.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see him being a star in his league,\u201d Hoge said.",

    "text": "Michael Phelps is entered in seven individual events at the Olympic trials.\n\nThe most pressing question looming over the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials was answered at about 2 p.m. Central Time on Sunday when 14-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps tweeted pictures of himself before and after his pre-race shave.\n\nGone was the mustache he sported last Saturday and with it any doubt he'd be swimming the 400 individual medley preliminaries today. And so an eight-day event that is loaded with talent and storylines will get the launch it deserves. The first final tonight, barring an unforeseen mishap this morning, will be the opening chapter of the much anticipated Michael Phelps-Ryan Lochte rivalry, 2012 edition.\n\nTheir competition for the mantle of world's greatest swimmer may be the biggest story of these trials -- it is certainly the most hyped -- but it's not the only one. Like Phelps, 11-time Olympic medalist Natalie Coughlin wants to leave an enduring legacy in what may be her final Olympics. Teenage phenom Missy Franklin wants to make a mark in what may be her first. Comebacks? Jessica Hardy, who was denied a chance at Olympic glory four years ago when she had to leave the team after a positive drug test, is back in the 100 breast as well as the 100 free and 50 free after serving a reduced one-year suspension. (An arbitration panel ruled the positive test wasn't her fault.) Dara Torres, now 45, is also back in the 50 free, seeking her sixth Olympic berth, 28 years after making her first. Anthony Ervin, 31, is trying to make the Olympic team 12 years after winning the 50 free in Sydney (in a tie, no swimoff needed). And Janet Evans, now a 40-year-old mother of two, is giving it a go again in the 800 free 16 years after her last Olympics. Against those epic pauses, breaststroker Brendan Hansen's two-and-and-a-half-year break from the sport seems like a mere power nap.\n\nStorylines aside, there's a lot of great racing ahead. Here are five events to watch:\n\nIn this event four years ago, Phelps and Lochte delivered the most captivating race of the 2008 trials. Phelps had to shatter his own world record by nearly a second to beat Lochte, who was nursing a twisted ankle. The two have not faced each other in this event since the final in Beijing, when Phelps won the first of his eight golds by beating Hungarian Laszlo Cseh and Lochte -- who was then recovering from a stomach bug -- in a world-record time of 4:03.8. Phelps, who vowed soon after that he wouldn't swim the grueling event again, hasn't swum it in a major international competition finals since, having been relegated to the consolation finals at the 2010 Pan Pacific championships.\n\nThis time both men are healthy and fit -- Lochte more so than he's ever been and Phelps -- well, we'll see. If this is just a two-man race like it was four years ago, it will be riveting enough. But 23-year-old Tyler Clary, who came in a distant fourth in this event at the 2008 trials, says he has been training all year \"to beat the world champion.\" If Phelps wants to join the fray, no problem, says Clary. \"I think I'm still going to make the team.\" (Clary, who is also entered in the 200 free, the 200 back and 200 fly, doesn't have the same confidence in the 200 IM; he won't be swimming it this year in Omaha.)\n\nCoughlin has a few things she'd like to do in London, should she make the U.S. team: a) become the first female to win the Olympic 100 backstroke three times; b) swim leadoff on the USA's medley relay, which has a great shot to win the Olympic gold after two straight silvers; and c) become the most decorated American female Olympian. (She needs two medals to surpass Jenny Thompson and Torres, who both have 12.)\n\nTo accomplish the first two and make headway on the third, the 29-year-old Californian will first have to fend off a pack of teenagers who have all broken a minute in the 100 back, including Liz Pelton, Rachel Bootsma and superstar-in-waiting Missy Franklin, the 17-year-old who is already drawing comparisons to, well, Coughlin, among others. Franklin, who considers Coughlin a role model, is the biggest threat to her reign: While Coughlin may kill her on the wall -- her underwaters are among the best in the world -- the 6-foot-1 Franklin has closing speed few can match.\n\nGiven that Lochte and Phelps finished 1-2 against a very deep and talented international field in this event at the world championships in Shanghai last summer, it's likely that everyone else in Omaha will be swimming for a relay spot.\n\nBut even if Ricky Berens, who beat both Lochte and Phelps at the Charlotte UltraSwim in May, can't hang on during the final lap and this becomes another mano-a-mano between the two rivals, it will be a thriller. The final turn will be critical. That's where Lochte killed Phelps in Shanghai. You can be sure that has been a point of emphasis in Phelps' training since.\n\nAfter swimming in the 4x200 free relay in the last two Olympics, Coughlin is passing on the chance to qualify this year. That still leaves a star-studded field, including Phelps' North Baltimore Aquatics training partner Allison Schmitt -- the American record holder who set a U.S. Open record of 1:55.04 in the event earlier this month -- Dana Vollmer, Katie Hoff and Franklin. Schmitt will be favored, but with Franklin's ruthless last-lap speed, this could be one of the best races of the week.\n\nAt that point in the meet it will be relevant to ask who's feeling the most pressure to make the team. Schmitt and Hoff will have had a shot on Monday in the 400 free; Vollmer in the 100 fly on Tuesday (she's favored); and Franklin in the 100 back on Wednesday. Hoff, who won a silver and two bronze medals in Beijing while feeling enormous pressure to do better, will be interesting to watch. Unlike four years ago, when she approached the trials with \"dread\" yet won five individual events, she says she is ready to \"enjoy\" the experience this time.\n\nThis may be the only event that both Lochte and Phelps will swim but neither will win. Both will likely swim at least a preliminary heat to put down a time to be considered for the 4x100 relay. Lochte won't swim the final (he has the 200 backstroke and 200 IM semis the same night) and it's highly unlikely Phelps will either, even though his time of 48.49 from March is the fastest for an American this year. Nathan Adrian, who hit a 48.50 at Santa Clara in June, will be the favorite.\n\nBeijing Olympians Garrett Weber-Gale, Ricky Berens and Jason Lezak, the now 36-year-old hero of that 4x100 free relay, will be in the hunt, as will Ervin. All will be trying to fend off Texas Longhorn Jimmy Feigen, who beat Phelps in Austin earlier this month in a personal-best 48.63. Given the speed of the Australian team -- led by phenom James Magnussen, who swam a 47.10 in March -- whoever makes the U.S. 4x100 free relay, says Berens, \"has their work cut out for them.\"",

    "text": "BEIJING \u2014 They are out there, hiding in library stacks, whispering in lecture halls, armed with dangerous textbooks and subversive pop quizzes: foreign enemies plotting a stealthy academic invasion of Chinese universities.\n\nSo says China\u2019s education minister, Yuan Guiren, who has been issuing dire alarms about the threat of foreign ideas on the nation\u2019s college campuses, calling for a ban on textbooks that promote Western values and forbidding criticism of the Communist Party\u2019s leadership in the classroom.\n\n\u201cYoung teachers and students are key targets of infiltration by enemy forces,\u201d he wrote on Feb. 2 in the elite party journal \u201cSeeking Truth,\u201d explaining that \u201csome countries,\u201d fearful of China\u2019s rise, \u201chave stepped up infiltration in more discreet and diverse ways.\u201d\n\nBut the government\u2019s latest attempts to tighten controls over the nation\u2019s intellectual discourse have raised concerns \u2014 and elicited rare open criticism \u2014 among teachers and students who reject the idea that foreign pedagogy and textbooks pose a threat to the government\u2019s survival. Indeed, they note, one of the most vocal arguments against such controls came from the education minister himself.\n\nFour years ago, he told a prominent government advisory panel that restricting the use of Western teaching materials was wrongheaded. \u201cNo matter how many foreign resources we import, we won\u2019t be at risk, because we\u2019re on Chinese soil,\u201d he said, according to a March 2011 article in the state-run Jinghua Times newspaper.\n\nReferring to the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students who have gone overseas to study, he added, \u201cWe even sent so many people abroad and they weren\u2019t affected in the nest of capitalism, so why fear they would be affected here?\u201d\n\nHis stark reversal highlights the growing tension between academics and party officials over the future of Chinese scholarship, and has given ammunition to his critics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just disappointed that the education minister doesn\u2019t have any backbone, and is simply saying what his superiors want him to say,\u201d said Helen Wu, 25, a graduate student at Shantou University in the southern province of Guangdong.\n\nTo gird China\u2019s impressionable young minds, Mr. Yuan has been championing new guidelines, issued last month, that call on the country\u2019s higher education institutions to prioritize the teaching of Marxism, ideological loyalty to the party and the views of President Xi Jinping.\n\nHe recently described Chinese schools as the \u201cideological front line\u201d in a battle against concepts like rule of law, civil society and human rights. Any \u201cwrong talk\u201d in social science and philosophy forums, he said, must be silenced.\n\nHis colorful speech, which amplifies the talking points of internal documents that have been circulating over the past two years, appears so far to have had little concrete impact on the nation\u2019s college campuses. Still, some academics expressed concern that such pronouncements would affect the quality of their teaching.\n\n\u201cProfessors personally feel that they\u2019re unable to properly explain things to their students,\u201d said a faculty member at Yunnan University in China\u2019s southwest, who asked not to be identified to avoid political repercussions. \u201cThey think, \u2018Oh, these university students, it\u2019s such a pity they won\u2019t be able to learn anything good anymore. No wonder so many Chinese people are willing to go abroad to study.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOthers warned that Mr. Yuan\u2019s remarks were reminiscent of the ideological purification campaigns of the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, the decade of chaos and violence unleashed by Mao that scarred a generation of Chinese intellectuals.\n\nThe notion that Western ideas are potentially subversive has been greeted with widespread incredulity, especially among Chinese intellectuals who note that Communism itself is a Western import. Xia Yeliang, a visiting fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington, said the campaign to vilify Western values was hypocritical.\n\n\u201cWas Karl Marx an Eastern person?\u201d asked Mr. Xia, who was an economist at Peking University until 2013, when he was fired for what he says were his anti-establishment political views. \u201cWeren\u2019t Marxism and socialism adopted from the West?\u201d\n\nBoth teachers and students, noting the growing surge of Chinese students studying abroad, say that China only stands to benefit from foreign ideas. In three years, the number of Chinese studying at American colleges soared 75 percent to more than 274,000 in the last academic year, making them the largest contingent of foreign students in the United States, according to the Institute of International Education. Among them was the president\u2019s daughter, who attended Harvard University, arguably the world\u2019s most renowned bastion of liberal Western learning.\n\nUntil recently, Mr. Yuan appeared to be an ardent supporter of such exchanges. \u201cWe can learn from the outside,\u201d he said in 2011. \u201cWhether they\u2019re rich or poor, socialist or capitalist, as long as they\u2019re beneficial to our development, we can learn from all of them.\u201d\n\nThough many academics have kept their frustrations private to avoid losing their jobs, some have openly expressed concern that limiting the availability of foreign textbooks and stifling classroom discussion would undermine China\u2019s quality of education.\n\nIn the wake of the education minister\u2019s protest of Western textbooks last month, Shen Kui, a professor at Peking University Law School in Beijing, one of the nation\u2019s pre-eminent institutions, published a letter online challenging the minister \u201cto clearly delineate the line between \u2018Western values\u2019 from Chinese values.\u201d\n\nMr. Shen also warned the education minister not to violate China\u2019s constitution or law in implementing the latest political decree, providing several handy constitutional quotes for easy reference, including the guarantee of \u201cfreedom to engage in scientific research, literary and artistic creation, and other cultural pursuits.\u201d\n\nParty ideologues have counterattacked in the state media in recent days, demanding harsh punishment for would-be liberal enemies, including prominent entrepreneurs, lawyers, artists and professors. In an editorial on Wednesday, Zhu Jidong, an official in the National Cultural Security and Ideology Construction department at the China Academy of Social Sciences, argued that the authorities must \u201celiminate the teachers who often publish criticism attacking the party and socialism before we can truly uphold virtue and condemn evil.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 2, Peking University pledged fealty to the party\u2019s latest directives in an online commentary and warned students not to be \u201cled by the wrong values from the West\u201d in the classroom.\n\n\u201cChinese universities are universities with socialist quality, so of course we should stick to socialist education,\u201d it said on the school\u2019s website.\n\nYet when asked about the presence of hostile foreign forces on campus, several students said they had seen nothing to raise suspicion.\n\nJimmy Bai, 23, acknowledged using foreign textbooks in the university\u2019s journalism graduate program but said he had encountered nothing subversive. \u201cAs a regular college student,\u201d he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t noticed anything.\u201d",

    "text": "Editor's note: Sandeep Jauhar, a cardiologist, is the author of \"Intern: A Doctor's Initiation\" and the recently released memoir \"Doctored: The Disillusionment of an American Physician.\"\n\n(CNN) -- I once took care of an 84-year-old woman with end-stage heart failure who told me she couldn't bear feeling short of breath any longer and pleaded with me to help her die. \"Is November 15 a good day for you?\" she asked.\n\nHer daughter shot out of a chair at her bedside. \"Ma, do you understand what you are saying?\"\n\nThe old lady stared at her and nodded slowly. \"I can't take it anymore,\" she said. \"Back and forth, back and forth to the hospital. I'd rather be dead.\"\n\nI explained that in New York state I could not assist in her suicide, though I could give her morphine to relieve her suffering.\n\n\"If you were like me, you'd say the same thing, doctor,\" she said ruefully. \"I'm half gone. Nobody wants to bother with you when you're like this.\"\n\nA couple of days later, I went to the ethics committee at my hospital.\n\nI explained that surgeons had deemed my patient's condition inoperable. Over the past couple of months she had been hospitalized several times with extreme shortness of breath due to congestive heart failure and treated with intravenous drugs. When the drugs were stopped, her heart failure symptoms quickly returned. This cycle was repeated several times before the day she asked me to help her die.\n\n\"She just doesn't want to suffer anymore,\" I said. \"She doesn't want to go through another episode of heart failure. She is absolutely terrified of it.\"\n\n\"I don't see the big ethical dilemma,\" a senior internist said. \"Put her on a morphine drip to relieve her suffering.\"\n\n\"But she isn't currently suffering,\" I replied.\n\n\"So put her on a low dose and titrate it up when she develops symptoms.\"\n\nThe problem was that she could go into a heart failure exacerbation very quickly. She could suffer for hours before her shortness of breath was brought under control, and that was in the hospital where nurses were with her around the clock.\n\nIn the end, I put my patient on a morphine drip. With her and her family's permission, we arranged for home hospice care. But she never made it out of the hospital.\n\nI thought of this patient when reading a terribly sad column on CNN.com by Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old with brain cancer who moved to Oregon so she can legally get a prescription for a drug that will end her life.\n\nUnfortunately, there are examples (though rare) where palliative or hospice care cannot adequately address the anxiety and suffering of dying patients. For example, in the case of my elderly patient, how can one start morphine in a patient who isn't suffering at that precise moment? For such patients in those rare cases, I support assisted suicide as practiced in Oregon.\n\nThrough Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, passed in 1997, more than 1,100 people have obtained life-ending prescriptions. About 750 have used them. The law does provide safeguards against clinically depressed or mentally incompetent patients getting lethal drugs to end their lives. Four other states have enacted similar laws.\n\nHowever, I still believe that for most terminally ill patients, hospice care is a better option than assisted suicide. Hospice offers team-based care with family involvement, often in a patient's home, that focuses on pain management and dying with some comfort and dignity. Hospice staff is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nThe modern hospice movement started in 1967, when Dame Cicely Saunders, a nurse, opened St. Christopher's Hospice in London. Saunders formulated three principles for easing the process of dying: relief of physical pain, preservation of dignity, and respect for the psychological and spiritual aspects of death.\n\nThe number of American hospitals offering palliative care has nearly doubled since 2000, growing to nearly 1,500 programs -- the majority of hospitals. Perhaps the most surprising finding from these programs is that hospice patients live a month longer on average than similar patients who do not receive such care.\n\nUnlike hospice care, assisted suicide is obviously a final and irreversible act. Ruling out the presence of clinical depression that may cloud a patient's judgment is not always straightforward. When depression lifts, the desire to die often lifts too. Only between 10% and 15% of people who attempt suicide eventually die by their own hands, suggesting that the desire to die is often changeable.\n\nAs a doctor, I would like assisted suicide to be safe and available, but rare.\n\nManaging end-of-life care for patients like Brittany Maynard is never simple. I often think of what the elderly woman with terminal heart disease who asked me to help her die told me: \"My husband said the hardest thing to do is to die; I always thought it would be easy.\"\n\nRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.",

    "text": "Fred Thompson, a Republican U.S. senator from Tennessee for eight years who also acted in feature films and on television, has died peacefully, his family said. Thompson died on Nov. 1 in Nashville after a recurrence of lymphoma at 73. (AP)\n\nFred Thompson, the former U.S. senator from Tennessee and acclaimed film and television actor who first gained national prominence as a lawyer on the Senate committee that investigated Watergate, died Nov. 1 in Nashville. He was 73.\n\nA family statement said he died after a recurrence of lymphoma.\n\nIn a multifaceted career, Mr. Thompson represented his state in the U.S. Senate from 1994 to 2003. He was also a lobbyist, radio host and columnist. Among other acting roles, he starred as a district attorney on the hit television series \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d\n\nMore than many of his contemporaries, Mr. Thompson, a product of a small-town upbringing, demonstrated the extent to which American life was open to possibility, in the courtroom and the hearing room, in the halls of Congress and on the sound stages of the entertainment world.\n\nHow Fred Thompson got to Hollywood[]\n\nA physically imposing man who stood 6-foot-5 and deployed a deep, syrupy voice, he was known as folksy but hardworking, and both amiable and ambitious during a career in which he prosecuted criminals in real life as well as on TV, played presidents on screen and sought the Republican presidential nomination in actuality.\n\nBut in a life of many phases, he first came to the attention of the American public in 1973 as one of the principal supporting players in one of the country\u2019s most celebrated political dramas, the Watergate hearings.\n\nThese held the nation spellbound through hot summer days, with a roster of engrossing characters and an almost-daily menu of startling plot twists. Of all that occurred at the hearings, one of the most breathtaking incidents was the revelation that White House conversations had been surreptitiously recorded.\n\nIt was during the questioning by Mr. Thompson of White House aide Alexander Butterfield that the public first learned of the taped conversations, with their potential to become incriminating evidence.\n\n\u201cMr. Butterfield,\u201d Mr. Thompson began, \u201cAre you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?\u201d\n\nMoments of silence followed as the country, tuned in on television, hung on Butterfield\u2019s response. It was in the affirmative.\n\nHistorians and scholars have probed into the story of how Mr. Thompson\u2019s question came to be asked, what lay behind it and who played the most significant role in unearthing the existence of the tapes. When Mr. Thompson posed his question, it was clear that he already knew what the answer would be.\n\nNevertheless, it was his questioning and the response it drew that have been recognized as a turning point in history. After the existence of the tapes became known, President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s ultimate resignation was regarded as inevitable.\n\nViewers of the hearings saw Mr. Thompson at the side of the senior Republican member of the Watergate committee, Sen. Howard Baker (Tenn.). Thompson was Baker\u2019s chief counsel. Baker became known for encapsulating the hearings in the question \u201cWhat did the president know, and when did he know it?\u201d\n\nFreddie Dalton Thompson was born Aug. 19, 1942, in Sheffield, Ala., and grew up about 40 miles away in the Tennessee town of Lawrenceburg. A statement released by his family quoted him as saying that the events and lessons of his small-town boyhood stamped him throughout his days.\n\nKnown in his adolescent years as easy-going, relaxed and fun-loving, he played basketball but was known as an indifferent student.\n\nLong afterward, when he announced from a platform in Lawrenceburg that he would seek the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, he said he wanted \u201cto tell my former teachers I\u2019m just as surprised to be here as you are to see me up here tonight.\u201d\n\nAccording to one account, he gained purpose after reading a book on the life of the famed defense attorney Clarence Darrow.\n\n\u201cAt 17,\u201d he has been quoted as saying, \u201cI knew I wanted to be a lawyer.\u201d He had married as a teenager, attended Florence State College in Alabama and Memphis State University in Tennessee, and went to Vanderbilt University law school on a scholarship.\n\nHe began practicing in Lawrenceburg and made Republican Party connections that helped him become an assistant U.S. attorney.

    "text": "WADE PFAU: One of the most hotly contested questions in personal finance is the debate over the safe withdrawal rate for retirees. That is, how much can someone expect to spend sustainably from their investments during their retirement years?\n\nThis question seemingly has the power to drive people to madness, perhaps because it brings up a fundamental reality about our existence. When it comes to financial market returns, we cannot predict the future. What do we need to do to be safe?\n\nHow much we can spend in retirement depends on a few variables: how much do we have to draw from, what rate of return will our assets earn, how long do we want our money to last, and how much do we still want to have available at the end of our planning horizon.\n\nFor instance, someone with $1 million who wants the money to last for 30 years with nothing at the end, and who earns a real return (after inflation) of 1.33%, could spend $40,109. This amount could grow with inflation in subsequent years. As a percentage of initial assets, that is just slightly above a 4% spending rate.\n\nEverything else the same, a higher investment return would allow you to spend more. For instance, replace 1.33% with 7% and the spending answer comes out as $75,314. This represents a 7.53% spending rate from initial assets. Perhaps surprisingly as well, with a 7% return assumption, if you wanted to preserve the full purchasing power of your initial retirement portfolio after 30 years, the sustainable spending rate falls only to 6.54%.\n\nThat was the state of analysis in the mid-1990s when William Bengen came onto the scene and did the research that led to the 4% spending rule. If the long-term average real compounding return from the stock market is 7%, does that mean one can safely use a 6.5% withdrawal rate from a 100% stocks portfolio without worrying about running out of wealth or even dipping into the original principal? Unfortunately, it does not.\n\nStocks do not earn their average real return each year. Some years they go up, and some years they go down, as recent investors know all too well. For a retiree who is taking distributions from his or her savings, the sequence in which market returns happens will matter. If a retiree\u2019s portfolio drops in value during the early retirement period, portfolio withdrawals will dig a further hole. Climbing out of this hole becomes increasingly difficult even if a subsequent market recovery arrives. This is sequence of returns risk. Sequence risk amplifies the impact of traditional investment volatility. To be more confident that a spending plan can work requires lowering our assumed investment return and checking if our spending goal will still be sustainable.\n\nWilliam Bengen\u2019s research on the 4% rule codified the importance of sequence of returns risk. The problem he set up is simple: a new retiree plans to withdraw an inflation-adjusted amount from his or her savings at the end of each year for a 30-year retirement period. What is the highest sustainable withdrawal amount as a percentage of retirement date assets, such that with inflation adjustments the portfolio spending will be sustainable for a full 30 years? If investors can maintain a stock allocation of 50%-75% over their retirement and precisely earn the investment returns obtained by underlying stock and bond indexes, then a 4% initial spending rate reflects the worst-case scenario that would have been experienced historically. Actually, it was a hypothetical retiree in 1966, experiencing the market returns from 1966 to 1995, who hit this low point.\n\nWe saw earlier that a 1.33% return assumption is what is needed to make the 4% rule work. For Bengen\u2019s data set, the actual compounded real return on a 50/50 portfolio during those 30 years was 4.2%. With the bad market returns happening early in this 30-year period and the good market returns coming only later, it was the further amplifying effects of this sequence of returns risk that made it seem like the compounded return over retirement was only 1.3% for retirees that year. Sequence risk matters a lot in a way that people don\u2019t realize when they are accumulating assets for retirement.\n\nThe debate today is about whether Bengen took the analysis far enough to provide a sufficiently conservative projection about the safe withdrawal rate. Is a 30-year planning horizon appropriate for today\u2019s longer living retirees? Is it appropriate to assume retirees can annually rebalance and maintain a rather aggressive stock allocation and precisely earn the underlying market returns net of fees and taxes? While a 4% spending rate represents the worst case outcome with U.S. historical data, how do we reflect that we have very little experience with knowing what happens when people retire at times when interest rates are at such low levels as today, while stock market valuations are also well above their historical averages? On the other hand, inflation is also quite low, and financial markets expect it to remain low. What implications does this have?\n\nTo better understand the debate, I have described two different schools of thought about planning for retirement income. I use the term probability-based to describe the Bengen side, which is comfortable with aggressive investment portfolios and with the assumption that the historical record is sufficient for guiding today\u2019s retirees.\n\nI use the term safety-first to describe the other school of thought, which begins with the premise that there is inherently no such thing as a safe spending rate from a volatile investment portfolio. To build a retirement plan consistent with this school, it is important to divide planned retirement expenditures between what is essential and what is more discretionary and to then match assets accordingly. Stocks are not part of the asset mix meant to cover essentials, as essentials should be covered by assets such as Social Security, pensions, individual bonds and income annuities. The stock market only gets included in the mix once the essentials have been properly covered.\n\nThe probability-based side views the safety-first approach as excessively conservative, while the safety-first side views probability-based strategies as reckless and dangerous for retirees. I worry that these viewpoints are further entrenched by the different business models used in the financial-services industry. The debate rages on, leaving the question about safe spending rates in retirement as one of the most controversial and divisive issues in personal finance.\n\nWade D. Pfau (@WadePfau) is a professor of retirement income in the Financial and Retirement Planning Ph.D. program at The American College and a principal at McLean Asset Management. He blogs on retirement research and maintains the Retirement Researcher website.\n\nRead the latest Big Issues in Personal Finance Report.",

Spain and Belgium already have warned their credit rating may be reduced.\n\nBritish banks like Barclays and HSBC are owed money by Ireland equal to 9.4% of the UK GDP. Another 5.7% of Britain\u2019s GDP has been loaned to Spain. These loans are equal to 15% of the British economy\u2019s dollar value.\n\nWhich doesn\u2019t sound very positive for British bank shares while the financial crisis is brewing.\n\nThe vitality of Europe\u2019s banks is exceptionally dependent on Spain\u2019s ability to service its debts.\n\nFrench banks are on the limb to Spain for 8.9% of French GDP.\n\nDutch banks have loaned 16.4% of the Netherlands\u2019 GDP to Spain.\n\nPortuguese banks are owed 13% of that nation\u2019s GDP from Spain as well.\n\nIrish banks\u2013 which have lost a third of their deposit base because of fears over bankruptcy\u2013 have loaned amounts equal to 14.5% of Ireland\u2019s total economy to Spain alone.\n\nThe condition of the European banks as well as the sovereign debt of Ireland, Portugal, Spain and possibly Italy are a definite downside risk for the global economic outlook. At minimum , expect volatile moves in bank shares as rescue attempts are proposed and the ECB tries to bind wounds of the early vulnerabilities in Ireland and Greece.\n\nIn our previous posting we showed that US banks had loans outstanding of $353 billion just to the 4 PIGS nations\u2013 Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain.\n\nColumbia Prof. Calomiris also expects the euro to take a further severe hit as Europe experience the multiple stresses that will impact economically and financially. \u201cThe Euro decline should be a significant event,\u201d he says.\n\nMulti-billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros weighed in today on the European bank crisis. His website reprinted an FT opinion piece calling for \u201cemergency funds \u2026 to be used to recapitalize banking systems as well as to provide loans to sovereign states\u2026 It would leave countries with smaller deficits, and they could regain access to the market sooner if the banking system were properly capitalized.\u201d\n\nSoros is upset that \u201cThe bondholders of insolvent banks are being protected at the expense of taxpayers, This is politically unacceptable,\u201d he says.\n\nCalomiris reckons one possible trade to do would be to buy gold and short the Euro as a way of benefiting from the distress. Another possible investment move would be to buy Credit Default Swaps against the risk of a large European bank becoming insolvent next year.\n\nIn the expectation that interest rates would rise in the US, Calomiris played the decline of the bond bull market by buying the ETF TGF which is short the 20 year maturity Treasury bond. Buying TGF, in his opinion \u201chas huge long term potential.\u201d\n\nJust since early September, when Fed Chairman Bernanke disclosed plans for QE2 , the value of TGF has risen 15%.",

Of course it is.\n\n\u201cIt is about all kinds of relationships, every kind of love in your life and mine.\n\n\u201cAnd I think it\u2019s both sides \u2013 it\u2019s not really from the woman\u2019s perspective this song \u2013 it was important to me that men, when they heard this song, felt connected to women even though the song is essentially about a barrier between us.\n\n\u201cThe song essentially is about how I believe that many of us are wondering why so many fake things that are around us appear to be real. They appear to be so real and it\u2019s almost impossible to decipher anymore what is authentic and what isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that easy to meet new people. I still make friends\u2026 it\u2019s just not as easy as it used to be, I guess.\n\nLyrics appear to reference a failed attempt at romance, including the chorus hook: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love, it wasn\u2019t love, it was a perfect illusion.\u201d\n\nFinding love again won\u2019t be simple for Gaga, who admitted she is struggling to meet new men.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to meet new people, no, like just strangers which I miss, I do.\n\n\u201cI will also be good speaking to strangers, which is really not a thing to teach to children, I find people interesting.\n\n\u201cI still make friends; it\u2019s just not like it used to be I guess.\u201d\n\nGaga made her long-awaited comeback with on Friday after a three-year absence from solo music, dropping her new single and performing a secret set in a tiny North London venue.\n\nIt was worth the wait.\n\nAs well as being a beautifully subtle post-mortem of her engagement to Taylor, Perfect Illusion is also a genuinely brilliant pop song in its own right.\n\nWithin hours of its release, the single was No.1 on iTunes in more than 60 countries, as she reminded the world why they fell in love with Lady Gaga in the first place.\n\nI was lucky enough to catch up with her in central London while the downloads racked up, and you can see some of the new interview tomorrow on ITV\u2019s Lorraine.\n\nDuring our chat, the singer also explained the other meaning behind the song, about the perils of social media.\n\nShe told me: \u201cYou\u2019re scrolling through social media or going through Instagram and you\u2019re overloaded with things that are filtered and in a way I believe that that has seeped into personal relationships, dating and friendship, so what\u2019s happening is we\u2019re trying to establish human connections but we\u2019re doing it through falling in love with a perfect illusion.\n\n\u201cSo I say in this song, \u2018dilated falling free in this modern ecstasy\u2019, and that\u2019s what Perfect Illusion is all about.\u201d\n\nDespite three No.1 albums and eleven Top Ten singles in the UK, Gaga was humbled by the instant success of her new single.\n\nEven her super-producer partner-in-crime MARK RONSON couldn\u2019t get his head around it.\n\nShe said: \u201cI think this is the first time in ages that I haven\u2019t been really at all, even the night before, wondering what the song was going to do chart wise.\n\n\u201cI have just been so focused on the music and being in the studio and when I woke up and saw that and as the hours went on it went No.1 I\u2019m relieved but I\u2019m also kind of in shock to be honest.\n\n\u201cAnd Mark is so funny he\u2019s like \u2018Is this just what happens? Did they think this was going to happen? How did this happen?\u2019 It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s well deserved and \u2014 most of all \u2014 it\u2019s long overdue.\n\nSHE has ditched booze, quarantined her crew and stuck to a strict exercise regime to stay fit and healthy during her 107-date world tour.\n\nBut ADELE will have to be smothered in Deet insect repellent to make the last 31 gigs.\n\nShe said at her show in Philadelphia on Saturday: \u201cI have been eaten alive by mosquitoes. I\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to a mosquito, I\u2019ve got blisters on my ankles!\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a mosquito bracelet on my leg \u2013 I\u2019m trying to make it look fashionable \u2013 and I\u2019ve had an allergic reaction, so I have blisters on my legs.\u201d\n\nHer allergy is a particular concern as she heads to Mexico City for two dates in November, where mozzies are infected with the dangerous Zika virus.\n\nShe also missed a gig in Arizona last month with a cold \u2013 at least a Berocca sorted that one out.\n\nIF there weren\u2019t already enough celebrities soaking up the style at New York Fashion Week, there certainly are now.\n\nThe weekend saw KENDALL JENNER own the catwalk at ALEXANDER WANG\u2019s spring/summer show and a star-studded crowd turned up to see her strut her stuff.\n\nMADONNA was joined by daughter LOURDES, on the front row, while JOURDAN DUNN, NICKI MINAJ and Kendall\u2019s little sis KYLIE had a great view, too.\n\nAway from the catwalk, romance was blossoming between F1 driver LEWIS HAMILTON and model WINNIE HARLOW, who were snapped together yet again.\n\nI revealed last week how the pair were growing close and they jetted to the Big Apple last week after attending the GQ Awards in London on Tuesday.\n\nLove was also in the air for GIGI HADID and boyfriend ZAYN MALIK, who held hands during a stroll in Manhattan.\n\nSerious Zayn\u2019s attitude is clearly rubbing off on Gigi, who didn\u2019t seem too happy in his company.

Lawmakers also debated the costs of imposing the death penalty.\n\nAs Mr. Quinn approached his announcement, he was lobbied by death penalty supporters, including family members of some victims, and by opponents, including the South African anti-apartheid leader Desmond Tutu, the death penalty opponent Sister Helen Prejean and the actor Martin Sheen.\n\nThe state\u2019s death penalty machinery had been halted since 2000, when the governor at the time, George Ryan, called the system \u201cbroken\u201d and declared a moratorium on executions. Before leaving office in 2003, Mr. Ryan, a Republican, commuted the sentences of 167 death row prisoners to life and pardoned four inmates.\n\nFifteen prisoners have been placed on the state\u2019s death row since then. The state has formed commissions to study the death penalty and has made some changes, but those favoring abolition argued that the system could not be tweaked into fairness.\n\n\u201cIllinois\u2019 experience of trying to fix the death penalty, and finding it can\u2019t be done, sends a real message to other states that are also grappling with the same problems,\u201d said Shari Silberstein, executive director of Equal Justice USA, a group that opposes capital punishment. \u201cIt\u2019s a real turning point in the conversation about the death penalty in the United States.\u201d\n\nBut Kent S. Scheidegger, legal director for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a group that supports the death penalty, called the governor\u2019s action \u201ca double-cross of the voters of Illinois.\u201d \u201cIf he had honestly told the voters he would sign a repeal bill\u201d during the campaign, Mr. Scheidegger said, \u201che would not be governor now.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats in the state had disagreed with a ban, including Lisa Madigan, the state\u2019s attorney general, who argued that the death penalty should be available as a punishment for the worst crimes. Anita Alvarez, the Cook County state\u2019s attorney and a Democrat, said she was disappointed by the governor\u2019s decision, and called it \u201ca tremendously disappointing day for murder victims and their families.\u201d\n\nDozens of family members of victims had signed a letter to the legislature supporting the bill, arguing that capital trials and appeals \u201cdrag victims\u2019 loved ones through an agonizing and lengthy process, which often does not result in the intended punishment.\u201d\n\nThe current and future mayors of Chicago took different sides, with Mayor Richard M. Daley supporting capital punishment, and Rahm Emanuel, who will became mayor this spring, saying the ban was the right thing to do.\n\nIllinois joins a wave of states that have reconsidered capital punishment. New Jersey abolished the practice in 2007. The New Mexico Legislature ended the death penalty in 2009. New Mexico\u2019s newly elected governor, Susana Martinez, a Republican, has asked the Legislature to reinstate it, though bills to do so have stalled. The Connecticut legislature voted to abolish the penalty last year, but the governor at the time, M. Jodi Rell, a Republican, vetoed the measure.\n\nRonald J. Tabak, a lawyer in New York who has argued death penalty cases, said that legislators were coming to understand that they could vote to abolish the death penalty without losing their next election, so long as they avoided moralistic arguments and focused instead on factors like accuracy, fairness and cost.\n\n\u201cAt least outside of the South, it is not the political death sentence, as often perceived by politicians, to be willing to vote for or be willing to sign into law an abolition bill,\u201d Mr. Tabak said.",

    "text": "Give Donald Trump credit for this: The Republican presidential candidate has done more to put a stake in the heart of the carried-interest tax loophole in the last month than the Obama administration has in the last six and a half years.\n\nThat\u2019s not for want of trying by the White House. President Obama has proposed closing the loophole in his budget proposals. He has tried to get rid of it as part of bargains on tax reform and budgets. There have also been efforts to kill it in Congress.\n\nYet it lives on, lining the pockets of billionaire financiers and hedge fund and private equity managers by giving them preferential tax treatment on a large portion of their compensation.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Republicans who have kept it alive. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, has voted to change the law. But he has long opposed any overhaul that singled out his wealthy Wall Street constituents and donors when other types of investment partnerships \u2014 oil and gas, real estate, timber \u2014 also benefit from the lower \u201ccarried interest\u201d tax.\n\nThen came the Trump phenomenon. Last month, he said he would close the carried-interest loophole. \u201cThe hedge fund guys didn\u2019t build this country,\u201d Mr. Trump told John Dickerson on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cThese are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe hedge fund guys are getting away with murder.\u201d\n\nAnd at Wednesday night\u2019s debate, Mr. Trump raised the issue again. \u201cThe hedge fund guys won\u2019t like me as much as they like me right now \u2014 I know \u2019em all,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll pay more.\u201d\n\nEarlier Wednesday, in a speech to the Business Roundtable, President Obama again called for carried interest to be taxed as ordinary income rather than at the lower capital gains rate. He put some teeth into the proposal by linking it to a resolution of the looming budget negotiations and threat of a government shutdown.\n\nEven Mr. Schumer threw his support behind this latest idea on Wednesday, saying that treating carried interest like ordinary income \u201cwould find a wealth of bipartisan support\u201d and could pave the way to a budget deal this fall.\n\nOther presidential candidates have piled on. All the Democratic candidates are on record against it. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont introduced legislation in July to get rid of preferential \u201ccarried interest\u201d tax treatment, and has argued that President Obama has the authority to unilaterally abolish it. Last week Jeb Bush, no populist maverick, jumped on the anti-carried-interest bandwagon.\n\nWith the emergence of what seems a rare bipartisan consensus, the arguments against closing the loophole \u2014 both political and economic \u2014 seem to be crumbling.\n\n\u201cA year ago no one was talking about this,\u201d said Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of San Diego, who has been crusading against the carried-interest loophole since 2004 and told me it was the issue that had defined his career. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that there\u2019s been this resurgence of interest.\u201d (Professor Fleischer is a contributor to The New York Times\u2019s DealBook.)\n\nEric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, said that Mr. Trump really put carried interest back in play. \u201cIt\u2019s a good populist talking point,\u201d Mr. Toder said.\n\nCarried interest is the percentage of investment gains that hedge fund managers, private equity executives and venture capital partners take as compensation, usually in addition to a management fee. (\u201cTwo and twenty\u201d has become Wall Street jargon for these funds\u2019 typical compensation scheme, meaning 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gains.) Because the \u201ccarry\u201d is tied to performance, it is treated like an investment and subjected to the lower capital gains tax rate, rather than as ordinary income, even though most managers don\u2019t put any of their own money at risk.\n\nThe loophole taps into the public\u2019s insecurities over the fairness of the tax system, and whether it unfairly benefits the wealthiest Americans.\n\n\u201cIt symbolizes how the 1 percent, or the one-tenth of 1 percent, can exploit the tax and legal system to their own benefit in ways ordinary people cannot,\u201d Professor Fleischer said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a teacher or a firefighter or a journalist, you can\u2019t transform your labor income into capital gains.\u201d\n\nThe issue has especially resonated with Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, because it demonstrates that he isn\u2019t beholden to big-money interests because he can finance his campaign with his own money.\n\nAnd for other Republican candidates, there\u2019s the specter of the Mitt Romney campaign. Exactly how much Mr. Romney benefited from the carried-interest loophole could not be determined, since he refused to release his tax returns before 2010. But as a former Bain Capital partner, he received substantial carried interest \u2014 31 percent of his 2010 and 2011 income, The Boston Globe reported. President Obama pilloried Mr. Romney over the issue during the 2012 campaign.\n\nWhile distinguishing between ordinary income and capital gains can be complex, \u201cthis one looks especially ugly to people,\u201d said Mr. Toder, who favors repealing the loophole. \u201cLook at salesmen who work on commission. Their compensation is at risk, too, but they don\u2019t get to treat their income like a capital gain.\u201d\n\nAnd the people who benefit are among the richest in the country. Even though most hedge funds haven\u2019t had a very good year, last year the top 25 hedge fund managers earned a combined $11.62 billion, according to Institutional Investor, or an average of $467 million each. The latest data from the Internal Revenue Service for the top 400 earners, a list studded with hedge fund and private equity managers, show that in 2012 they paid the second-lowest average federal tax rate since the data has been collected, a mere 16.7 percent, in large part because much of their income (an average of 57 percent) is taxed at the lower capital gains rate.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason the loophole has survived as long as it has. \u201cThe group that benefits may be small, but they\u2019re rich and they give a lot of money\u201d to politicians, said Daniel Shaviro, a specialist in tax policy and law professor at New York University School of Law. \u201cTo everyone else it can seem a vague talking point. It\u2019s classic interest group politics.\u201d\n\nEstimates of how much revenue closing the loophole would raise vary, in part because it\u2019s hard to know if hedge fund managers and others who benefit would alter their behavior by holding assets longer, in that way deferring taxes. The Treasury estimates it would raise $18 billion over 10 years; Professor Fleischer contends it would be 10 times that much, $180 billion.\n\nIn Washington, carried interest has become a bargaining chip in contentious negotiations between the White House and Congress. Most politicians would give it up in the right circumstances, and it has always been on the short list of what should be repealed if there were a bipartisan deal.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s frustrating is that carried interest is always held hostage to negotiations over tax reform,\u201d said Professor Fleischer. \u201cAnd tax reform is always coming tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIn May, Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, blocked an effort to link the carried-interest issue to corporate tax reform, arguing it was an individual tax issue and should be negotiated in that context, perhaps in 2017. But many Republicans have indicated they are not against repealing the loophole, as long as they get something from Democrats in return. (A spokesman for Mr. Ryan said he was not available for comment.)\n\nRepublican opposition to reform may be harder to sustain now that Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush have gone rogue on the carried-interest issue while also taking populist stances on other economic issues.\n\n\u201cIf closing the carried-interest loophole, ending subsidies for oil and gas, and tackling inversions are good enough for Donald Trump and Jeb Bush, it ought to be good enough for Republicans in Congress,\u201d Mr. Schumer said this week.\n\nAlthough the political stars seem to be aligning in their favor at last, opponents of the carried-interest tax break aren\u2019t declaring premature victory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s on people\u2019s radar,\u201d Professor Fleischer said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned not to bet on it.\u201d After 11 years fighting the issue, he said, \u201cI\u2019m wiser than I was as a young pup.\u201d\n\nCorrection: September 17, 2015 An earlier version of this column misstated the year that President Obama pilloried Mitt Romney over the carried-interest loophole. It was 2012, not 2008.",

    "text": "Even four months after the Supreme Court's divisive Hobby Lobby decision, we still have no idea just how broad the ruling's impact will be.\n\nThat's thanks to the ambiguity of the 5-4 decision, which said owners of \"closely held\" for-profit businesses don't have to offer contraceptive coverage that violates their religious beliefs. The problem is the court didn't define what actually constitutes a \"closely held\" business that could claim such an exemption in the first place. And federal regulators who'll have to enforce the court's decision are looking for clarity.\n\nSo the Obama administration over the summer asked for the public to weigh in on just how narrowly or broadly this carve out should be, and formal comments are starting to come in.\n\nThe administration offered a couple of approaches, and it's a safe bet that it will try to keep the exemption as narrowly defined as possible to limit the potential erosion of what it sees as one of its key accomplishments \u2014 mandated coverage of contraception without cost-sharing for female employees.\n\nThere's no universally agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a closely held business. They tend to be smaller companies, but they could even be large firms, like Cargill, which employs 145,000 people. The IRS has its own definition of \"closely held\" businesses:\n\nA 2009 study estimated 52 percent of the country's workforce comes from closely held businesses. So it seems like the universe of these firms could potentially be pretty large. That's not to suggest, though, that a vast majority of these firms will suddenly look to drop contraceptive coverage.\n\nBut more than three dozen advocacy groups supporting the mandated coverage are pushing for a much narrower definition than the approaches formally proposed by the Obama administration.\n\nThey write that the court's Hobby Lobby decision held that corporations can only claim an exemption under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act when a corporation's business practices \"reflect and promote the owners' religious beliefs.\" The craft store chain Hobby Lobby, for example, has corporate documents indicating an agreement to run their business in accordance with shared religious principles. The groups, which include the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and NARAL Pro-Choice America, say in order for a company to seek such a religious exemption, it should have a unanimous agreement among its owners to run the business under the same religious principles.\n\nHowever, groups who challenged the birth control coverage requirement see things differently. Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented the second company in the Hobby Lobby case \u2014 Conestoga Wood Specialties \u2014 argues that the court's decision prohibits the administration from putting more restrictions on defining \"closely held\" businesses. The exemption should be even broader, it argues.\n\n\"Not only did Hobby Lobby not impose artificial limits on the definition of a close corporation, it did not even say that publicly traded corporations cannot exercise religion,\" the group writes in formal comments.\n\nThe Obama administration will have to review these comments and others before finalizing its policy, which could take a few months. And there's still another round of cases from religiously affiliated nonprofit groups that could reach the Supreme Court this term. So the fight over the birth control mandate is far from settled.\n\nJason Millman covers all things health policy, with a focus on Obamacare implementation. He previously covered health policy for Politico.\n\nSECTION: {section=business, subsection=null}!!!

    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2013 The former neighborhood watch volunteer who killed Trayvon Martin told his wife to buy bulletproof vests for them and for his attorney, according to jailhouse calls released Monday.\n\n\"As uncomfortable as it is, I want you wearing one,\" George Zimmerman told his wife. Zimmerman was wearing a bulletproof vest when he left jail after posting bond. His attorney, Mark O'Mara, has reported receiving threats.\n\nThe calls, released by prosecutors, also detail how Zimmerman instructed his wife to transfer money from bank accounts and could play a crucial role in his second bond hearing next week.\n\nZimmerman was released on $150,000 bond in April, several days after the calls took place. At his bond hearing, his wife, Shellie, testified that she didn't know how much money had been raised from a website created for his legal defense. She also testified that they had limited funds because she was in school full time and Zimmerman wasn't working.\n\nProsecutors say the calls show George and Shellie Zimmerman knew that roughly $135,000 had been raised by the site.\n\nShellie Zimmerman was arrested last week on a charge of making a false statement. George Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty, claiming self-defense during the confrontation with the 17-year-old teen in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. The case sparked protests across the country when George Zimmerman wasn't arrested at first and led to nationwide debate over race and self-defense laws.\n\nIn one call, Zimmerman tells his wife and sister how to change a computer password at a credit union so they can move funds around.\n\nIn another call, Shellie Zimmerman said that money raised from the website was also being used to pay off bills. The couple also talked about how they would whisk Zimmerman away from the Seminole County Jail once he was released in April, and discussed using a rental car to drive to a hotel parking garage. There, they would change into another rental car to throw off anybody who tried to follow him.\n\nShellie Zimmerman told her husband that the website had crashed because of supporters leaving words of support, as well as donations.\n\n\"Wow, that is awesome,\" Zimmerman said. \"Those people need to start vocalizing themselves.\"\n\nProsecutors originally had planned to release 151 of Zimmerman's jailhouse calls, but O'Mara objected. A hearing over their release is set at the same time as Zimmerman's bond hearing next week.\n\n\"It is our contention that the calls are not only irrelevant to the charges against Mr. Zimmerman, but they could jeopardize friends and family of Mr. Zimmerman who are unrelated to the case,\" O'Mara said on a website for Zimmerman's legal defense.",

What makes Apple\u2019s recently announced music streaming service, Apple Music, any different?\n\nAccording to Apple execs Eddy Cue and Jimmy Iovine, the difference is control. They say they want to shift power back into the blistered hands of the musicians and artists that create the industry\u2019s content. So they\u2019ve transformed the recently acquired Beats Music streaming service into Apple Music: a library of music, plus a radio station \u2014 Beats 1 \u2014 and playlists curated by human DJs. (Rather than robots or algorithms.)\n\nApple Music also includes another feature, Apple Connect, that lets artists interact with their fans. The appended social network \u2014 a bloglike platform that the Guardian describes as \u201cpart-SoundCloud, part-Facebook and part-YouTube,\u201d \u2014 allows musicians to share messages, tracks, photos and videos with their fans. It\u2019s not hard to see how this could be used to offer exclusive content and behind-the-scenes material to subscribers.\n\nDrake, for instance \u2014 the hip-hop artist who helped unveil the service at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developer\u2019s Conference this week \u2014 plans to release his next album through Connect.\n\nIt\u2019s that kind of control that Apple senior VP Cue hopes will set Apple Music apart. \u201cOur viewpoint was very simple,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cLet the artist and label control it. They can put it up on Connect for free if they want to, or they can put it up behind the [subscription] paywall, or they can make it available on the iTunes Store for sale. They\u2019re in control of their music and how they want to distribute it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Iovine, who also spoke to the Guardian, juggling the interests of all parties involved is no easy feat. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a win for everybody: there has to be a win for the consumer, a win for the artist, a win for the rightsholders,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to give artists a place where there\u2019s a rhyme and a reason: where there\u2019s an ecosystem where it feeds off each other. Where there\u2019s a payoff! And not just a financial payoff, but an emotional payoff. A creative payoff.\u201d\n\nUntil more details are released \u2014 for example, how voluminous the service\u2019s music archive will be, which artists will sign on to the service exclusively, whether the song curation is substantially different or any better than its competitors, and just how much musicians will benefit, economically and otherwise, from the deal \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say whether Apple Music\u2019s \u201cpayoff\u201d will be worth the payout.",

    "text": "During my marathon, I ran next to a man wearing an Eiffel Tower costume. Several women raising money for breast cancer drew cheers from the crowds for running in their decorated bras. I also spent time alongside several members of the Achilles Track Club, for athletes with disabilities.\n\nMy marathon included four stops to hug my daughter along the route, a quick jaunt into a deli in Queens to buy a banana, and countless high fives with kids along the course. I also spent about three miles talking and walking with Maureen Donohue, 68, of Long Island, who began running at age 56 and was taking part in her 10th marathon. To train, she run-walks a five mile course near her home, takes a coffee break and heads back out again for five more miles. I found her inspiring, and so did the crowd. As we passed by, onlookers shouted, \u201cGo, Mo, go!\u201d\n\nDespite their pace, back-of-the-packers still struggle with leg cramps, blisters and back spasms, and so did I. I finished my first marathon in 6 hours 58 minutes 19 seconds. I know faster marathoners are bothered by so-called plodders. A recent front-page article in my own newspaper quoted a number of marathoners to that effect, saying we had ruined the race\u2019s mystique.\n\nIt\u2019s true that marathons around the country are getting slower, as more charity runners and run-walkers take part. In 1980 the average marathon time was about three and a half hours for men and about four hours for women, according to Running USA. Today, the averages are 4:16 for men and 4:43 for women. About 20 percent of the participants in the New York City Marathon take longer than five hours to finish.\n\nBut the legendary gold medalist Frank Shorter says the criticisms of slow runners are \u201csnobbery.\u201d \u201cYou never hear that from elite runners,\u201d he told me. \u201cElite runners admire other people\u2019s performance. I find it much better to welcome slow runners to the club than to vote them out.\u201d\n\nGreg Meyer, who in 1983 was the last American man to win the Boston Marathon, says that when he hears such complaints from average marathoners, he replies, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the run-walkers, you wouldn\u2019t be finishing in front of anybody.\u201d\n\nThe main benefit of the run-walk method is that it eases your body into exercise, makes marathon training less grueling and gives muscles time to recover, reducing the risk of injury. Walk breaks are an ideal way for new runners and older, less fit and overweight people to take part in a sport that would otherwise be off limits.\n\nThe downside is that just as you are out on the marathon course about 50 percent longer than the average runner, your training time is much longer, too \u2014 four and five hours a weekend for long runs.\n\nAbout 10 days before the marathon, I began to doubt my ability to finish the race. A flulike illness had sidelined me for a few weeks, and I\u2019d missed some important training runs. I questioned whether it would be worth the effort to straggle over the finish line long after most of the runners had left.\n\nBut then, during an easy run on a trail near my house, I spotted another slow runner ahead of me. It took a moment before I realized his off-kilter gait was due to the fact that he was running on a Cheetah foot, an artificial limb that uses a flexible blade for the foot. He was young and fit, and I wanted to know his story, but didn\u2019t stop him to ask. Instead I just watched his rhythmic run, and felt my own worries about race day fade away. It didn\u2019t matter how fast I finished, just that I was out there, enjoying the view from the back of the pack.",

    "text": "Following that black and white iPhone 7 teaser video from last week, Apple has launched a new series of commercials promoting the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch Series 2 and each one is, in true Apple tradition, a tiny work of art.\n\nThe first is titled \"Midnight,\" and it takes us on a trip with a skateboarder who has an eye for night photography. Designed to show off the iPhone 7's low-light powers, the one-minute mini movie is oddly intimate, even while touting the most talked about technology product on the planet.\n\nNext there's \"Morning Ride,\" a 30-second dip into the world of a cyclist who, suddenly called by nature's pull, decides to emerge from his garage and go for a ride. The spot ends on an epic frame of storm clouds gathering in front of the biker. The message: Yes, the newly water-resistant iPhone 7 can survive the looming downpour.\n\nFinally, \"Go Time\" is Apple's new take on promoting the powers of the Apple Watch, and the breathtaking visuals are not only convincing, they're a tad inspirational.\n\nFrom surfing to basketball to swimming to yoga, we see the Apple Watch Series 2, and the Apple Watch Nike+ (with that distinctive, perforated band), put through the rigors of all manner of sports, and even a bit of meditation. Next to the device's apparent durability, the message here also tends to focus on the device's newly water-resistant capabilities.\n\nAll this action is set to the music of Nina Simone's \"Sinner Man,\" which transports the video from common commercial into cultural message territory, familiar ground for Apple.\n\nThat message appears to be focused on the notion of bringing our technology further into the natural parts of everyday life, whether that means thunderstorms, ocean waves or the usually dark, photo-obscuring pitch of night.\n\nHowever, there's something different about these latest spots. Sure, Apple is known for producing slick television commercials, but these feel a lot more like short films. The devices are at the center of each video, but you actually feel like you're peeking in on a part of a story.\n\nThis could be a mere change in directors and/or producers, or it could be yet another indication of Apple's increasing interest in producing original content.\n\nIf it's the latter, then we may be in for a interesting ride from Apple, as these new spots are about as well shot and visually engaging on a narrative level as your favorite cable television drama or indie film.",

    "text": "Less than six months after ABC News appointed Elizabeth Vargas and Bob Woodruff as successors to the late Peter Jennings on \"World News Tonight,\" the network announced today that it was scrapping its experiment with joint anchors and installing Charles Gibson as the program's lone anchor.\n\nABC's move comes after Mr. Woodruff was seriously injured in Iraq in January, preventing him from appearing on the news program since then.\n\nMr. Gibson, the host of \"Good Morning America\" on ABC for nearly two decades (except for a brief hiatus in the late 1990's), will take over \"World News\" on Monday night. But his real challenge will begin in September, when another popular morning host, Katie Couric, takes over the \" CBS Evening News,\" putting her in direct competition for viewers with Mr. Gibson and with \"NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams.\"\n\nMr. Gibson will leave \"Good Morning America\" in July, at the moment the broadcast could least afford to let him go. The program, which has been trying for years to overtake the ratings leader, \"Today\" on NBC, has seized on the looming departure of Ms. Couric (and the arrival of her replacement, Meredith Vieira) as a possible turning point.\n\nNow the two other co-hosts of \"Good Morning America,\" Diane Sawyer and Robin Roberts, will have to take on \"Today\" without Mr. Gibson.\n\nIn an ABC statement today, Ms. Sawyer, who was widely described within ABC News as a candidate for the \"World News\" job, offered warm praise for Mr. Gibson but did not address how long she might stay on in the morning.\n\nMs. Vargas, who is due to give birth to her second child in August, said in a statement from ABC that she had decided to begin her maternity leave this month, a move that would limit her return in the fall to her other job at ABC, as co-host of the prime time news magazine \"20/20.\" Ms. Vargas said her decision to leave \"World News\" \u0097 a dream job for which she had campaigned aggressively \u0097 was dictated by her pregnancy and had come at her request.\n\n\"My doctors have asked that I cut back my schedule considerably,\" she said in the ABC statement, before adding, \"The broadcast needs someone who can give 150 percent \u0097 day in and day out. I am not in a position to give that right now and it wouldn't be fair to do any less.\"\n\nIn the statement, she did not speak directly to why she could not return to the \"World News\" anchor desk after her maternity leave, other than to say that \"what works for me and my family is to return in the fall to '20/20' as I raise my new baby and young son.\"\n\nMr. Woodruff has been recuperating since late January from severe head wounds suffered only a few weeks into his anchor job, during a brief reporting trip in Iraq. In a statement, Mr. Woodruff effectively ceded the broadcast to Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"Charlie Gibson is a mentor and friend,\" he was quoted as saying. \"I look forward to contributing to his broadcast as soon as I am able.\"\n\nIn turning to Mr. Gibson, one of the best-known journalists on television, ABC is seeking to bring a sense of calm to a news division and flagship broadcast that have been in turmoil since Mr. Jennings announced in April 2005 that he was ill with lung cancer. He died in August.\n\nIn initially choosing Ms. Vargas and Mr. Woodruff in December as Mr. Jennings's heirs, David Westin, the president of ABC News, said he hoped to draw new viewers to the evening news by entrusting it a younger generation. Both new hosts were under 45 at the time.\n\nMr. Westin had also taken great pains at the time to characterize the \"World News\" anchor responsibilities \u0097 which now includes an afternoon Webcast, as well as live updates for West Coast viewers \u0097 as having grown too big for one person.\n\nWhile Mr. Gibson, then 62, was a candidate in December as well, he said at the time that he and Mr. Westin had disagreed over how long he might lead the program before turning it over full time to Ms. Vargas and Mr. Woodruff.\n\nWith Ms. Vargas acting mostly as a solo anchor in Mr. Woodruff's absence, \"World News\" has been losing viewers in recent weeks. Last week, for the first time in nearly five years, it drew fewer viewers over the course of a single week than the \"CBS Evening News,\" which finished second to Mr. Williams's program on NBC.",

    "text": "WEDNESDAY\u2019S health care rally was one of President Obama\u2019s finest hours. It was so fine it couldn\u2019t be blighted even by his preposterous backdrop, a cohort of white-jacketed medical workers large enough to staff a hospital in one of the daytime soaps that refused to be pre-empted by the White House show.\n\nObama\u2019s urgent script didn\u2019t need such cheesy theatrics. At last he took ownership of what he called \u201cmy proposal,\u201d stating concisely three concrete ways the bill would improve America\u2019s broken health care system. At last he pushed for a majority-rule, up-or-down vote in Congress. At last he conceded that bipartisan agreement between two parties with \u201chonest and substantial differences\u201d on fundamental principles wasn\u2019t happening. At last he mobilized his rhetoric against a villain everyone could hiss \u0097 insurance companies. In a brief address, he mentioned these malefactors of great greed 13 times.\n\nThere was only one problem. This finest hour arrived hastily and tardily. At 1:45 p.m. Eastern time, who was watching? Of those who did watch or caught up later, how many bought the president\u2019s vow to finish the job \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d? We\u2019ve heard this too many times before. Last May Obama said he would have a bill by late July. In July he said he wanted it \u201cdone by the fall.\u201d The White House\u2019s new date for final House action \u0097 specified as March 18 by Robert Gibbs, the press secretary \u0097 is already in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThey are waiting for us to act,\u201d Obama said on Wednesday of the American people. \u201cThey are waiting for us to lead.\u201d Actually, they have given up waiting. Some 80 percent of the country believes that \u201cnothing can be accomplished\u201d in Washington, according to an Ipsos/McClatchy poll conducted a week ago. The percentage is just as high among Democrats, many of whom admire the president but have a sinking sense of disillusionment about his ability to exercise power.\n\nNow that we have finally arrived at the do-or-die moment for Obama\u2019s signature issue, we face the alarming prospect that his presidency could be toast if he doesn\u2019t make good on a year\u2019s worth of false starts. And it won\u2019t even be the opposition\u2019s fault. If too many Democrats in the House defect, health care will be dead. The G.O.P. would be able to argue this fall, not without reason, that the party holding the White House and both houses of Congress cannot govern.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s say that Obama does eke out his victory. Republicans claim that if he does so by \u201cramming through\u201d the bill with the Congressional reconciliation process, they will have another winning issue for November. On this, they are wrong. Their problem is not just their own hypocritical record on reconciliation, which they embraced gladly to ram through the budget-busting Bush tax cuts. They\u2019d also have to contend with this country\u2019s congenitally short attention span. Once the health care fight is over and out of sight, it will be out of mind to most Americans. We\u2019ve already forgotten about Afghanistan \u0097 until the next bloodbath.\n\nThe 2010 election will instead be fought about the economy, as most elections are, especially in a recession whose fallout remains severe. But that battle may be even tougher for this president and his party \u0097 and not just because of the unemployment numbers. The leadership shortfall we\u2019ve witnessed during Obama\u2019s yearlong health care march \u0097 typified by the missed deadlines, the foggy identification of his priorities, the sometimes abrupt shifts in political tone and strategy \u0097 won\u2019t go away once the bill does. This weakness will remain unless and until the president himself corrects it.\n\nThose who are unsympathetic or outright hostile to Obama frame his failures as an attempt to impose \u201csocialism\u201d on a conservative nation. The truth is that the Fox News right would believe this about any Democratic president no matter who he was and what his policies were. Obama, who has expanded the war in Afghanistan and proved reluctant to reverse extra-constitutional Bush-Cheney jurisprudence, is a radical mainly to those who believe a conservative Republican senator like Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas is a closet commie.\n\nThe more serious debate about Obama is being conducted by neutral or sympathetic observers. There are many hypotheses. In Newsweek, Jon Meacham has written about an \u201cinspiration gap.\u201d He sees the professorial president as \u201csometimes seeming to be running the Brookings Institution, not the country.\u201d In The New Yorker, Ken Auletta has raised the perils of Obama\u2019s overexposure in our fractionalized media. (As if to prove the point, the president was scheduled to appear on Fox\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d to celebrate its 1,000th episode this weekend.) In the Beltway, the hottest conversations center on the competence of Obama\u2019s team. Washington Post columnists are now dueling over whether Rahm Emanuel is an underutilized genius whose political savvy the president has foolishly ignored \u0097 or a bull in the capital china shop who should be replaced before he brings Obama down.\n\nBut the buck stops with the president, not his chief of staff. And if there\u2019s one note that runs through many of the theories as to why Obama has disappointed in Year One, it cuts to the heart of what had been his major strength: his ability to communicate a compelling narrative. In the campaign, that narrative, of change and hope, was powerful \u0097 both about his own youth, biography and talent, and about a country that had gone wildly off track during the failed presidency of his predecessor. In governing, Obama has yet to find a theme that is remotely as arresting to the majority of Americans who still like him and are desperate for him to succeed.\n\nThe problem is not necessarily that Obama is trying to do too much, but that there is no consistent, clear message to unite all that he is trying to do. He has variously argued that health care reform is a moral imperative to protect the uninsured, a long-term fiscal fix for the American economy and an attempt to curb insurers\u2019 abuses. It may be all of these, but between the multitude of motives and the blurriness (until now) of Obama\u2019s own specific must-have provisions, the bill became a mash-up that baffled or defeated those Americans on his side and was easily caricatured as a big-government catastrophe by his adversaries.\n\nObama prides himself on not being ideological or partisan \u0097 of following, as he put it in his first prime-time presidential press conference, a \u201cpragmatic agenda.\u201d But pragmatism is about process, not principle. Pragmatism is hardly a rallying cry for a nation in this much distress, and it\u2019s not a credible or attainable goal in a Washington as dysfunctional as the one Americans watch in real time on cable. Yes, the Bush administration was incompetent, but we need more than a brilliant mediator, manager or technocrat to move us beyond the wreckage it left behind. To galvanize the nation, Obama needs to articulate a substantive belief system that\u2019s built from his bedrock convictions. His presidency cannot be about the cool equanimity and intellectual command of his management style.\n\nThat he hasn\u2019t done so can be attributed to his ingrained distrust of appearing partisan or, worse, a knee-jerk \u201cliberal.\u201d That is admirable in intellectual theory, but without a powerful vision to knit together his vision of America\u2019s future, he comes off as a doctrinaire Democrat anyway. His domestic policies, whether on climate change or health care or regulatory reform, are reduced to items on a standard liberal wish list. If F.D.R. or Reagan could distill, coin and convey a credo \u201cnonideological\u201d enough to serve as an umbrella for all their goals and to attract lasting majority coalitions of disparate American constituencies, so can this gifted president.\n\nHe cannot wait much longer. The rise in credit-card rates, as well as the drop in consumer confidence, home sales and bank lending, all foretell more suffering ahead for those who don\u2019t work on Wall Street. But on these issues the president, too timid to confront the financial industry backers of his own campaign (or their tribunes in his own administration) and too fearful of sounding like a vulgar partisan populist, has taken to repeating his health care performance.\n\nAnd so leadership on financial reform, as with health care, has been delegated to bipartisan Congressional negotiators poised to neuter it. The protracted debate that now seems imminent \u0097 over whether a consumer protection agency will be in the Fed or outside it \u0097 is again about the arcana of process and bureaucratic machinery, not substance. Since Obama offers no overarching narrative of what financial reform might really mean to Americans in their daily lives, Americans understandably assume the reforms will be too compromised or marginal to alter a system that leaves their incomes stagnant (at best) while bailed-out bankers return to partying like it\u2019s 2007. Even an unimpeachable capitalist titan like Warren Buffett, venting in his annual letter to investors last month, sounds more fired up about unregulated derivatives and more outraged about unpunished finance-industry executives than the president does.\n\nThis time Obama doesn\u2019t have a year to arrive at his finest hour. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the clock runs out on Nov. 2.",

((Courtesy: The Indianapolis Star)\n\nA social worker at an Indianapolis Veteran Affairs clinic was disciplined earlier this year after sending emails to colleagues that contained photos of an elf figurine posed to mock the mental health problems of combat veterans.\n\nRobin Paul, who manages the Roudebush Veteran Affairs Medical Center\u2019s Seamless Transition Integrated Care Clinic, on Dec. 18 sent an email with photos showing an elf pleading for Xanax and hanging himself with an electrical cord, according to The Indianapolis Star, which broke the story. A spokeswoman for the facility, Julie Webb, said the matter was dealt with in January, but declined to say what action, if any, was taken.\n\n\u201cManagement was made aware of the situation a month and a half ago and addressed it at the time,\u201d Webb told FoxNews.com. \u201cMs. Paul apologized. She has helped to build the clinic up and this was an error in judgment that does not reflect the Indianapolis Veterans Affairs\u2019 commitment to providing high-quality health care to our veterans.\u201d\n\n- Ken Hylton, American Legion\n\nPaul could not be reached for comment, but told The Indianapolis Star that she was sorry in an email the hospital\u2019s public affairs department sent on her behalf.\n\n\u201cI would like to sincerely apologize for the email message and I take full responsibility for this poor judgment,\u201d Paul wrote in the email. \u201cI have put my heart and soul into my work with Veterans for many years. I hold all veterans and military personnel in the highest regard and am deeply remorseful for any hurt this may have caused.\u201d\n\nOne email, addressed to \u201cIND STICC Team\u201d and obtained by The Indianapolis Star, contained the subject line, \u201cNaughty Elf in the STICC clinic.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, photos have appeared that indicate that the STICC clinic may have been invaded,\u201d it read. \u201cLooks like this magical character made his way through a few areas.\u201d\n\nOne photo showed the elf giving a female doll a gynecological exam, and bore the caption: \u201cTrying his skills as a primary care provider (doing a pap).\u201d\n\nAnother showed the elf next to a sticky note with the words, \u201cOut of XANAX \u2014 please help!\u201d That caption read, \u201cSelf-medicating for mental health issues when a CNS would not give him his requested script.\u201d\n\nA third photograph showed the elf hanging from a strand of Christmas lights, with the caption: \u201cCaught in the act of suicidal behavior (trying to hang himself from an electrical cord).\u201d\n\nNews of the email is the latest in a series of black eyes for the massive agency, which has been under fire for facilities that altered their books to hide the number of patients who died while awaiting appointments.\n\nThe latest controversy drew outrage from veterans groups.\n\n\u201cIt is a slap in the face to our recent and past veterans suffering from mental health issues every single day,\u201d Ken Hylton, commander of the Indiana Department of the American Legion, told the newspaper, adding that Paul should be fired.\n\nPete Hegseth, CEO of Concerned Veterans of America and a Fox News contributor, agreed.\n\n\"While this shameful act may be an isolated incident, what\u2019s not isolated are the almost daily reports that feed the perception that VA leadership are detached from the urgent challenges facing returning veterans,\u201d Hegseth said. \u201cBut it\u2019s even more troubling that Ms. Paul\u2019s shockingly poor judgment did not merit immediate firing. She should have been fired the minute such poor judgment was discovered and failing to do so only reinforces VA's track record of failing to hold its employees accountable.\"\n\nPaul remains employed at the hospital and continues to manage the clinic, earning an annual salary of $79,916, according to the Star.",

He knew basic commands \u2014 sit, stay, shake hands. And when he wanted to eat, he\u2019d ring bells dangling from a wall hook and then head to the kitchen.\n\nDog and trainer set off on a cross-country car ride on Jan. 10 and pulled into Manhattan six days later.

He gets to a plateau and he scans the horizon for prey.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Luchta stares straight into the orchestra seats \u2014 and sends shivers. The feral presence is in step with the spooky production, which earned a mixed review from the Daily News. The wolfen walk-on lasts less than a minute, but audiences leave impressed.\n\n\u201cA hush fell over the audience,\u201d said Steve Tarca, 30, a guest-service supervisor who lives in Queens and saw the play on Wednesday. \u201cYou could hear audible gasps.\u201d\n\nHis friend Rosanne Carlo, 30, who teaches writing at the College of Staten Island, described Luchta \u201cas another bad omen. He was scary and predatory.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s all an act. \u201cHe\u2019s so friendly and good-natured,\u201d said Berloni. \u201cStill, when he\u2019s on a leash 90% of people who comment say, \u2018Is that a wolf?\u2019\u201d\n\nSiobhan Wilder described her 78-pound pet as \u201ca goofy lunk.

    "text": "On a recent bitterly cold afternoon, Monica Sibri hunches over her laptop in the College of Staten Island\u2019s student center. Between constant phone calls, texts and emails, the senior student hardly manages to catch a breath.\n\nShe tends to every request before returning her attention to preparing talking points for a Latino civil rights conference she is attending the next day. Sibri, who is 22 and undocumented, says she manages 14- to 16-hour days. \u201cI barely sleep,\u201d she tells me in a rare pause from her duties.\n\nSibri is the chair and founder of the CUNY Dreamers, a citywide student group with chapters on many of New York City\u2019s public university campuses dedicated to advocating for the rights of 6,000 undocumented students in the CUNY system. Some members of the group won a massive victory on Monday, as CUNY announced it was returning thousands of dollars to about 150 undocumented immigrant students who overpaid for their tuition.\n\nSibri started the group last year to provide students with a platform where they could learn their legal rights and procure the advocacy training she says is necessary to pass the state Dream Act in this year\u2019s legislative session in Albany.\n\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t understand what it means to be undocumented, and they don\u2019t want to understand,\u201d said Alondra Ramos, a member of CUNY Dreamers and a close friend of Sibri\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to always be one step ahead.\u201d\n\nThe New York state Dream Act, which the state comptroller says would cost the state less than $20m per year, would allow some undocumented students in New York to access state financial aid and scholarships for higher education through the state\u2019s Tuition Assistance Program, open accounts in its 529 college savings program, and raise private funds for a scholarship program for the college-bound children of immigrant parents.\n\nThe bill would not grant work permits or legal status, two issues that are central to undocumented students\u2019 fundamental vulnerability: they are still \u201cdeportable and can\u2019t work legally\u201d, says Muzzaffar Chishti, an expert on US immigration policy who heads the office for the Migration Policy Institute, a thinktank at New York University School of Law.\n\n\u201cOnly the federal government can dictate immigration policy,\u201d said Chishti. \u201cA Dream Act at the state level certainly has its benefits, like helping kids pay for school, and I don\u2019t want to downplay that. But to celebrate this as a huge benefit that has long-lasting effects does a disservice to the Dreamers at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nIf the bill passes, New York would become the sixth US state to allow undocumented students to access state-funded financial aid.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are digging their heels for the legislative fight while the clock is ticking for thousands of undocumented students across the state who are wondering how they will pay next semester\u2019s tuition, says Manny Castro, campaign coordinator at the New York Immigrant Coalition. Without access to state financial aid, Castro says, these students are excluded from a system that they and their parents have financially contributed to for years.\n\n\u201cSo much has been invested in the lives of Dreamers by the state,\u201d said Castro. \u201cIt then makes no sense for New York to be turning its back on these young people when they reach college, especially when they\u2019ve done all that\u2019s been asked of them.\u201d\n\nCobbling together tuition: life savings, odd jobs and private scholarships\n\nSibri herself is undocumented, having arrived in New York City more than six years ago with her two younger sisters from her native Ecuador. For the three siblings, who lived with their grandparents and other family members for five years in Ecuador after their parents made the journey north in search of economic opportunity, immigration status was not something discussed at their home in Brooklyn\u2019s Sunset Park, a largely working-class immigrant enclave with pristine cross-river views of the distant Manhattan skyline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something my parents felt comfortable discussing, so I had no idea I was undocumented, or what that even meant, until I started applying to colleges in my senior year of high school,\u201d said Sibri. \u201cI was told by my high school counselor and administrators that college would be fully out of pocket for me because I didn\u2019t have papers. My grades didn\u2019t matter, all that I had worked for until that point didn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s when I first felt that I was truly excluded from the system.\u201d\n\nSibri gathered tuition money partially through her parents\u2019 life savings, by working odd jobs off the books and from outside private scholarships. Others in her predicament have not been as fortunate. According to the New York State Youth Leadership Council, a New York City-based non-profit, of the estimated 4,500 undocumented students who graduate high school every year in New York state, only 5-10% of them pursue college study due to the tremendous financial burden on their families.\n\nFor many, like Mehdi Mahraoui, college usually isn\u2019t even an option. The story of how the 24-year-old native from Morocco got to CUNY\u2019s John Jay College in Manhattan is, he says, \u201ca miracle\u201d.\n\nHe was brought to the US by his parents at the age of seven, along with his two younger sisters; his parents sold away all their possessions in Casablanca and bought one-way plane tickets to New York to try their luck in America.\n\nYears later, as a high school senior in Queens\u2019 Far Rockaway neighborhood, Mahraoui was a few months away from graduating and knew college was financially out of the question. He was a member of his school\u2019s rowing team, and his coach approached him after practice one day and asked him where he was looking to attend university. Embarrassed, Mahraoui was forced to explain to his coach that his undocumented legal status prohibited him from accessing the crucial financial aid that would make it possible for him to continue his studies.\n\nOnce word spread of his situation, Mahraoui\u2019s team-mates began soliciting donations. They asked strangers on subway cars, at bus stops, outside bodegas. Overall, they raised over $2,000 in their efforts, which covered Mahraoui\u2019s first semester at John Jay.\n\nSince then, like Sibri, he has stayed in school by working off the books and earning outside private scholarships. His improbable story reached the White House, who invited him and six other Dreamers from across the country to a May 2014 private meeting with President Obama, Vice-President Biden and aides.\n\n\u201cIt was a weird feeling, because being undocumented in this country you feel like you\u2019re just a nameless, faceless statistic,\u201d said Mahraoui. \u201cBut here we were, sharing our stories with the president. I felt for the first time that my story meant something.\u201d\n\nLast week, around 20 Dreamers from across the state convened at the University of Albany for the first annual New York Dreamers Conference. The students, who hailed from both CUNY Dreamers and SUNY Dreamers \u2013 a sister organization that covers the state\u2019s public university system outside New York City \u2013 had just finished a whirlwind weekend of lobbying Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the state legislature at the capitol to support the Dream Act.\n\nThe mood in the room was upbeat, but the students recognized the very real political obstacles facing the bill. For most of the group, though, there was still hope if the bill failed: an overwhelming majority of them qualify for Obama\u2019s expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, program, which he announced last November along with an expansion to the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, or Dapa. The actions would grant temporary legal status to as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants across the country, including an estimated 600,000 newly eligible Dreamers across the country.\n\nSibri, the leader and voice of their movement, does not qualify. She came to the US at 16 years and four months of age, just missing the 16-year-old cutoff for eligibility. She is left out.\n\nStill, she says she is ecstatic for her friends and family and will continue to fight for comprehensive reform in the nation\u2019s broken, complex immigration system.\n\n\u201cI devote my time to helping others because I know how it feels to have nobody to rely on,\u201d said Sibri. \u201cThe Dreamers are my network of support and I advocate for them so that one day they will do the same.\u201d",

    "text": "More than 6,000 gallons of oil has been raked, skimmed and vacuumed from a spill that stretched across nine miles of California coast, just a fraction of the sticky, stinking goo that escaped from a broken pipeline, officials said.\n\nUp to 105,000 gallons may have leaked from the ruptured pipeline on Tuesday, and up to 21,000 gallons reached the sea off the Santa Barbara coast, according to estimates. The environmental impact still is being assessed, but so far there is no evidence of widespread harm to birds and sea life.\n\nFederal regulators investigated as workers in protective suits shoveled the black sludge off beaches and boats towed booms into place to corral the two slicks.\n\nThe chief executive of Plains All American Pipeline LP, which runs the pipeline, visited the spill site on Wednesday and apologized.\n\n\u201cWe deeply, deeply regret that this incident has occurred at all,\u201d the chairman and CEO, Greg L Armstrong, said at a news conference. \u201cWe apologize for the damage that it\u2019s done to the wildlife and to the environment.\u201d\n\nArmstrong said the company received permission to continue cleanup operations around the clock and vowed that they \u201cwill remain here until everything has been restored to normal\u201d.\n\nCrude was flowing through the pipe at 54,600 gallons an hour during the leak, the company said. Company officials didn\u2019t say how long it leaked before it was discovered and shut down or discuss how fast the oil escaped.\n\nFederal regulators from the Department of Transportation, which oversees oil pipeline safety, investigated the leak\u2019s cause, the pipe\u2019s condition and the potential violations.\n\nThe 24-inch pipe built in 1991 had no previous problems and was thoroughly inspected in 2012, according to the company. The pipe underwent similar tests about two weeks ago, though the results had not been analyzed yet.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the company accumulated 175 safety and maintenance infractions since 2006, according to federal records. The infractions involved pump failure, equipment malfunction, pipeline corrosion and operator error. The newspaper said a Plains Pipeline spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its regulatory record.\n\nThere was no estimate on the cost of the cleanup or how long it might take. A combination of soiled beaches and the pungent stench of petroleum led officials to close Refugio state beach and El Capitan state beach over Memorial Day weekend. Both are popular campgrounds west of Santa Barbara.\n\nStill, tourists pulled off the Pacific Coast Highway to eye the disaster from overlooking bluffs.\n\n\u201cIt smells like what they use to pave the roads,\u201d said Fan Yang, of Indianapolis, who was hoping to find cleaner beaches in Santa Barbara, about 20 miles away. \u201cI\u2019m sad for the birds if they lose their habitat.\u201d\n\nThe early toll on wildlife included two oil-covered pelicans, said spokeswoman Melinda Greene. Biologists were seen counting dead fish and crustaceans along sandy beaches and rocky shores.\n\nThe state department of fish and wildlife closed fishing and shellfish harvesting for a mile east and west of Refugio beach and deployed booms to protect the nesting and foraging habitat of the snowy plover and the least tern, both endangered shore birds.\n\nThe coastal area is habitat for seals, sea lions and whales, which are now migrating north through the area.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown on Wednesday night declared a state of emergency because of the spill, a move that frees up additional state funding and resources to help in the cleanup.\n\nSanta Barbara County district attorney Joyce Dudley said her office, along with the state attorney general, is investigating the pipeline spill for possible criminal prosecution or a finding of civil liability.\n\nThe coastline was the scene of a much larger spill in 1969, the largest in US waters at the time, that is credited with giving rise to the American environmental movement.\n\nEnvironmental groups used the spill as a new opportunity to take a shot at fossil fuels and remind people of the area\u2019s notoriety with oil spills.\n\n\u201cBig Oil comes with big risks from drilling to delivery,\u201d said Bob Deans, spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cSanta Barbara learned that lesson over 40 years ago when offshore drilling led to disaster.\u201d\n\nLarge offshore rigs still dot the horizon off the coast, pumping crude to shore and small amounts of tar from natural seepage regularly show up on beaches. The leak occurred in a pipe that was carrying crude from an onshore facility toward refineries further down the chain of production.",

    "text": "Of all the scary stats you've heard about the U.S. economy over the last few years, this might be the scariest: Almost two-thirds of American households earn less money today than they did in 2002.\n\nThat figure comes from a detailed new report by economist Rob Shapiro for the Brookings Institution - a report that underscores the dramatic downshifting that has occurred for low- and middle-class workers since the turn of the century, and which threatens to undermine our national hope that in America every generation will do better than the one that came before.\n\nShapiro's analysis shows young people who entered the workforce in 1991 and 2001 aren't seeing the same pattern of lifetime wage gains that workers who joined the job market in the 1970s and 80s experienced. He also shows that those older workers are now losing income at a much faster pace than they gained it.\n\nAt the end of the 20th Century, Shapiro said, workers at all levels were seeing wages rise. \"It was a classic illustration of broad and democratic upward mobility,\" he said. \"That process simply stopped with the 2001 recession and the 2001-2007 expansion.\"\n\nThat stoppage has rained pain on older and younger workers alike, as you can see in this chart.\n\nWhen we talk about middle-class wage stagnation, we're usually talking about the country's median household income, which is to say, the amount earned by the household exactly in the middle of the American income distribution. Shapiro looked at the question differently. He analyzed Census data that group workers into age cohorts, and then tracked those workers over time.\n\nNot surprisingly, he found that median incomes in those cohorts tend to change as workers age. First incomes go up, then eventually they level off, and finally they fall. That general pattern hasn't changed over time. But for younger workers today, incomes haven't risen as far as their predecessors' did, and the leveling-off process appears to have started much earlier.\n\nTwo-thirds of American households are headed by someone who did not earn a college degree. From 2002 to 2013, those households, even as they aged, saw their median incomes fall by 9.4 percent (for those headed by high school graduates) and 17.3 percent (for those headed by high-school dropouts).\n\nNotice, in this chart, the difference in the experience of workers who were in their 20s in the 70s and 80s, versus those in the 90s and 2000s.\n\nThe older workers built incomes for much longer, and their peak incomes were higher. The workers who came of age in the 1990s tech bubble and the 2000s housing bubble saw incomes rise faster, but level off much earlier. The 1975 cohort saw its median household incomes rise by 60 percent before it peaked. For the 1982 cohort, it was 70 percent. For the '91 cohort, it was 50 percent; for the 2001 group, it was just over 20 percent.\n\nIt's no guarantee that those younger workers' incomes have leveled off for good -- for the 2001 group, median income was on the rise again in 2013 -- but if they have, we are talking about a huge loss of earnings over a lifetime, compared to the workers who went before them.\n\nLife's not great right now for those older workers, either. Look at how fast their incomes have fallen:\n\nThe 1975 cohort saw its median income plunge by nearly $30,000 from 2000 to 2013. The oldest of those workers only begin to turn 65 this year.\n\nThere's bad news in the report for everyone, basically. Women and minorities have lost all the progress they made in closing the median income gap with men. College graduates are doing better than everyone else, but their income growth has stalled - or gone backwards - for all but the youngest workers.\n\nShapiro is a former economic advisor to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, and he blames those trends on two structural shifts in the economy that were accelerating at the end of the Clinton era and into the 2000s. One is the rise in globalization, which he said has pushed U.S. companies to cut jobs and wages in order to compete on price for foreign competitors. The other is the advancement of labor-saving technology that has hurt the market value of lower-skill workers.\n\nShapiro also said the numbers in his analysis add up to a simple and cautionary explanation for the growing unrest among working class voters. In a Pew Research Center poll this week, a little more than - you guessed it - two-thirds of voters said government policies since the recession have done little to help the middle class.\n\n\"If we have another 10 years in which the incomes of two-thirds of Americans decline, you won't recognize the politics in this country,\" he said. \"This is the source of the Tea Party, of substantial anger at the government. Give it another 10 years and see what happens.\"\n\nIt's probably better if we don't.\n\nJim Tankersley covers economic policy for The Post. He's from Oregon, and he misses it.",

    "text": "Crosby versus Ovechkin. Sid vs. Alex.\n\nIt's the showdown that could redeem the NHL playoffs for unrepresented Canadian hockey fans and nervous TV executives alike.\n\nThe faces of their respective franchises will undoubtedly be the main event in the upcoming second-round series between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals.\n\nBut what about the undercard?\n\nThere are an abundance of plotlines, noteworthy players, and a chance to move one step closer to the Stanley Cup. Fans may tune in for the latest chapter in the Ovi-Sid saga, but here are several reasons why they'll stick around for the whole series.\n\nFans of the Toronto Maple Leafs should probably skip the next paragraph.\n\nPhil Kessel has looked more comfortable outside of the southern Ontario spotlight, finishing third in both goals and points on the Penguins this season. He's had a successful post-season so far, registering three goals and three assists against the Rangers.\n\nFor Leafs fans looking for a second chance, City Folk's hilarious web comic chronicles the transcredible exploits of The Phil.\n\nAs for the Capitals, the off-season addition of T.J. Oshie has added more firepower to an already potent offence. The former St. Louis Blues forward has carved a niche for himself on the team's top line and power-play unit. His 11 power-play goals are second only to Ovechkin's 19.\n\nPittsburgh's Evgeni Malkin and Washington's Evgeny Kuznetsov share more than a first name. The (almost) name-twins are both imposing, talented, left-shooting centres who are a constant scoring threat.\n\nKuznetsov (#TeamY) had a career year, leading the team in points by tallying 20 goals and 57 assists. Equally skilled with a pen as he is with a hockey stick, the 23-year old gave fans an insight into his hockey-centric upbringing in Chelyabinsk earlier this season in The Players' Tribune.\n\nAs for Malkin (#TeamI), he continued to struggle with injuries this season. Despite missing 25 games, the marshal from Magnitogorsk managed 58 points in the regular season and has embraced the role of distributor in the playoffs with five assists.\n\nWhich spelling (and therefore player) do you prefer? Vote here to settle this Cyrilic spelling bee.\n\nOne of the biggest difference-makers for Washington this year has been the stellar play of goalie Braden Holtby.\n\nThe presumptive Vezina favourite tied an NHL regular-season record with 48 wins and was a bastion of consistency during the Caps' Presidents' Trophy run.\n\nWhile Washington's goaltending situation has been stable throughout the year, Pittsburgh's has been the complete opposite.\n\nPenguins netminder Marc-Andre Fleury is still dealing with the effects of a concussion sustained on March 30. In the wake of Fleury's second concussion of the season, goaltending duties have been shared by Matt Murray and Jeff Zatkoff.\n\nGoing forward, Pittsburgh will likely rely on the 21-year old Murray, who posted a 3-0 record in the first-round series against the New York Rangers after taking over for Zatkoff in Game 3.\n\nTwo players that don't make the headlines but make a tremendous difference for the Capitals are Nicklas Backstrom and Marcus Johansson. Pittsburgh would be wise to keep an eye on them, as the duo combined for 39 regular-season goals and 13 playoff points.\n\nAs for the Penguins, Patric Hornqvist registered over 50 points for the fourth time in his career and continues to complement Crosby well on the top line.\n\nThese teams have a well-chronicled rivalry, so there's bound to be a few grudges. What makes this edition of Pens versus Caps even more compelling is that there are turncoats on both sides.\n\nWashington (n\u00e9e Pittsburgh) defenceman Matt Niskanen, along with injured teammate Brooks Orpik may not get a warm welcome in their return to Western Pennsylvania. The same may also be true for new Penguins forward Eric Fehr, who played nine of his first 10 seasons in the U.S. capital.\n\nAre you a sad Los Angeles Kings fan? We've found your new team!\n\nNo mention of former Angeleno Mike Richards, though.\n\nFor those of you fond of athletic aesthetics, the Pens and Caps both have gorgeous throwbacks in their respective repertoires.\n\nWould it be too much to ask to see the teams sport these stunning sweaters throughout the series?\n\nGame 1 takes place Thursday night in Washington.",

    "text": "As you faithful readers are well aware, at this early stage head-to-head general election polling is not at all predictive of campaign outcomes. So take what follows as merely an effort to plant a flag on something to keep an eye out for as the campaign progresses.\n\nThere is a striking finding in the new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll: Marco Rubio is tied with Hillary Clinton among young voters. Given the importance of Barack Obama\u2019s overwhelming margins among young voters to his two victories \u2014 and, more broadly, given that Democrats are betting the future of the party on their rising coalition of young voters and minorities \u2014 this is something Democrats should probably start paying attention to right now.\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll\u2019s toplines are that Rubio holds a 48-45 lead over Clinton among adults nationally, effectively a tie. By contrast, Clinton leads Donald Trump by 50-40, and she leads Ted Cruz by 48-45 (also effectively a tie). But note this data from the crosstabs, sent over by the good folks at NBC:\n\n\u2014 Clinton and Rubio are tied among voters who are 18-34 years old, 45-45.\n\n\u2014 Clinton leads Trump among these voters, 54-33.\n\n\u2014 Clinton leads Cruz among these voters, 49-40.\n\nThis is only one poll; the sample sizes are not that large; and again, early polling is not predictive. Also, the poll shows Ben Carson also practically ties Clinton among these young voters. But Carson is not credible; the point is that of the credible candidates, Rubio performs far better in this poll among these voters against Clinton than the others do. And note that the recent Quinnipiac poll also showed Rubio trailing Clinton by only seven points among young voters, a margin (if accurate) that is far too close for comfort and is far tighter than it is for Trump (who trails by 20 points among them) or Cruz (who trails by 18).\n\nSo take this as something to watch for: How Clinton will fare among young voters \u2014 and whether Rubio can substantially cut into the Dem advantage among them \u2014 are crucial unknowns. The Clinton campaign is already thinking about this: Amy Chozick of the New York Times reports that Clinton advisers have grown concerned that younger women are less excited by the historic promise of electing the first female president than Baby Boomer females are. The Clinton camp is moving to appeal to younger women with a focus on issues like equal pay, college affordability, and women\u2019s health care. More broadly, it remains to be seen whether Clinton can motivate or culturally connect with young voters to the degree Obama did. Veteran Dem pollster Stan Greenberg recently sounded the alarm on this matter, too.\n\nWhy would Rubio do better (again, assuming the polling is on to something here) against Clinton among these voters than Cruz, who is the same age as the Florida Senator? Recall that the Rubio campaign is actively building its long term strategy around the belief that a GOP candidate must make inroads among Dem voter groups to win, while Cruz appears more wedded to the notion that running up huge turnout among evangelicals and other GOP base groups is the secret. Rubio is trying to strike hopeful, optimistic tones, and repeatedly says that a new generation of leaders is required, a point that Cruz appears far less interested in making. Rubio\u2019s apparent performance edge over Trump and Cruz among young voters is another sign that nominating Trump or Cruz might be self-destructive demographic folly for the GOP.\n\nTo be sure, there are plenty of things that could prevent Rubio from seriously cutting into these voters, such as his conservative positions on abortion, women\u2019s health, gay marriage, and climate change. But one of the big questions about 2016 remains remains whether Clinton can achieve Obama-level turnout among the voter groups that powered Obama\u2019s two victories in national elections. And the prospect that the Democratic advantage among young voters is not a foregone conclusion is one Democrats should take seriously. This goes beyond just 2016, since young voters are crucial to the grand wager that Dems are placing on the idea that demographics \u2014 in the form of the Rising American Electorate of millennials, minorities, socially liberal college educated whites, and single women \u2014 will keep trending their way for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cThat any Republican at this point can theoretically breach the Democratic demographic firewall is a reminder that the new coalition strategy was always more opportunity than destiny,\u201d Dem strategist Simon Rosenberg, an early proponent of that demographic strategy, tells me. \u201cIt still needs to be earned by every Democratic candidate in every cycle. It\u2019s clearly no longer a given.\u201d\n\n* GOP CANDIDATES SILENT ON CLIMATE DEAL: Did you know that a landmark global climate deal was reached in Paris over the weekend? To the Republican presidential candidates, it isn\u2019t really news at all:\n\nIn a stark display of the partisan divide in the United States over climate change, the Republican presidential candidates have said almost nothing about the Paris Agreement, even though whoever succeeds Mr. Obama will be tasked with carrying it out. Of the nine who will participate in Tuesday\u2019s prime-time debate on CNN, only Gov. John Kasich of Ohio would provide an assessment of the deal when asked on Sunday.\n\nAs I\u2019ve reported, a Republican president could pull the U.S. out of the deal, though in substantive and political terms it could prove a lot harder than it might seem.\n\n* OBAMA MULLING A TRIP TO CUBA: In an interview with Olivier Knox, the President says it just might happen:\n\nThe president said he hopes that \u201csometime next year\u201d he and his top aides will see enough progress in Cuba that they can say that \u201cnow would be a good time to shine a light on progress that\u2019s been made, but also maybe (go) there to nudge the Cuban government in a new direction.\u201d White House aides privately describe an Obama visit \u2013 under the right circumstances \u2013 as the logical culmination of the new policy direction that he announced almost exactly one year ago.\n\nThat \u2014 combined with the reaction from Republicans \u2014 would be quite the media spectacle.\n\n* TRUMP-MENTUM RAGES ACROSS OUR FAIR LAND: A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll finds Donald Trump at the top among GOP primary voters nationally: He has 27 percent; Ted Cruz has surged to 22 percent; and Marco Rubio is at 15 percent. Ben Carson has tanked:\n\nCarson is now in fourth at 11 percent (down 18 points) \u2014 and much of his support has transferred to Cruz. Indeed, while the poll shows Carson dropping 23 percentage points among \u201cvery conservative\u201d Republican primary voters since October, it has Cruz up with this group by an equal amount.\n\nAs expected, Cruz is scooping up much of Carson\u2019s support. If Trump fades, it seems plausible that Cruz will be able to grab a chunk of those spoils, too.\n\n* TED CRUZ GRABS LEAD IN IOWA: A new Bloomberg/Des Moines Register poll finds that Ted Cruz has surged into a lead in Iowa: Cruz takes 31 percent of likely caucus-goers; Trump has 21 percent; Carson is at 13; and Rubio is at 10. Joshua Green digs out some important findings:\n\nCruz, for the first time, is winning both non-college voters (Cruz 32, Trump 23, Ben Carson 13) and college voters (Cruz 29, Trump 18, Carson 12) alike\u2026.respondents who say they support Trump have an extremely positive view of Cruz: 73 percent view him favorably, while 18 percent view him unfavorably.\n\nThus, Cruz appears to be attracting the non-college Republicans who might have been Trump supporters, and seems poised to scoop in more Trump voters. Relatedly, also see this excellent piece by Perry Bacon, Jr., on Cruz\u2019s growing success among evangelicals.\n\n* HILLARY EXPANDS LEAD IN IOWA: A new Bloomberg/Des Moines Register poll also finds that Hillary Clinton has increased her lead over Bernie Sanders in Iowa to 48-39 among likely Democratic caucus-goers. Here\u2019s how they compare on a range of attributes:\n\nIowa voters who say they will definitely or probably attend the Democratic caucus give Clinton the edge in nine of 13 traits, including having the best temperament and life experience to be president and being best able to combat Islamic terrorism and manage the economy. More say Sanders is trustworthy and would do more to help the middle class and rein in Wall Street.\n\nClinton currently leads in the Iowa polling averages by 54-36. If she wins Iowa, that would offset a Sanders win in New Hampshire, which is far more likely, and then it\u2019s on to the other contests where her broader coalition might give her an edge.\n\n* THE FACTOID OF THE DAY: Courtesy of NBC News: \u201cSince Sandy Hook, an American kid has died by a gun every other day.\u201d NBC tallies up some 554 children under 12 killed by guns since the Newtown shooting in December of 2012. And it\u2019s possible that the number is higher.\n\n* REASONS FOR HOPE ABOUT CLIMATE DEAL? The Paris climate deal, by itself, won\u2019t do nearly enough to keep warming at the threshold scientists have identified. But Paul Krugman notes that there are reasons for optimism, because technological advances are reducing the price of renewal energy, which could have long term ramifications:\n\nThis energy revolution has two big implications. The first is that the cost of sharp emission reductions will be much less than even optimists used to assume \u2014 dire warnings from the right used to be mostly nonsense, but now they\u2019re complete nonsense. The second is that given a moderate boost \u2014 the kind that the Paris accord could provide \u2014 renewable energy could quickly give rise to new interest groups with a positive stake in saving the planet, offering an offset to the Kochs and suchlike.\n\nAlso: As energy consultants have told me, you could see some utilities in the U.S. begin deciding that this is the way of the future and thus push for smoother implementation of Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which will be key to the U.S. keeping its commitments to the deal.\n\n* AND AMERICANS WILL REJECT TRUMPISM. RIGHT? E.J. Dionne writes today that we must not forget that Trump\u2019s support only represents a tiny right-wing sliver of the American electorate. But don\u2019t get too complacent:\n\nOur country is far more tolerant and sensible than you might imagine if all you did was pay attention to the Trump mania in the news coverage\u2026.But an exasperation with traditional politicians, anxieties over personal security and apprehensions about economic opportunity extend well beyond the far right. The politicians who count on the moderate majority can try its patience only for so long. Trump is a containable menace. He is also a wake-up call.\n\nBut wait, can\u2019t we figure out a way to blame his rise on some platitudinous factor like a hatred of Washington or a desire for disruption, or perhaps on disaffected voters in both parties?",

    "text": "Zygmunt Januszewski at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts in 2010. Photograph: Peter Hirth/Camera Press\n\nThe Polish artist and illustrator Zygmunt Januszewski, who has died aged 57 after suffering from cancer, opened a window in the Guardian to an unfamiliar but enticing landscape. In 1991, as the result of partnership with several European newspapers, the Guardian began publishing their articles translated into English and found illustrators to complement the writing. Zygmunt's drawings held a great appeal from the time I first saw them in the smudgy pages of the Warsaw daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. I loved the quality of the drawing, the imagination and the insight that they gave into the soul of a formerly oppressed nation; Poland's transition to democracy had begun two years earlier.\n\nThe work that Zygmunt did for the Guardian, inhabited by fantastical characters portrayed with a witty and bizarre sense of humour, brought a quite different dimension to the pages. It illuminated articles on fascism by Umberto Eco, or the politically convoluted career of the Austrian writer Peter Handke, or the difficulties facing central Europe, swinging between east and west. But I had the sense that his strange men brandishing flags, or his ramshackle machines built of words, were engaged in a struggle with separation, isolation, self-definition or alienation.\n\nZygmunt was born and educated in Warsaw. He studied in the graphics faculty of the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts (1976-1981), where his diploma work was a set of illustrations for Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's novel One Hundred Years of Solitude. In 2002 he returned to the academy, now as a teacher of illustration.\n\nA flourishing career was marked by international success \u2013 the many publications to carry his illustrations included S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Die Zeit, Die Welt, Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung, Le Monde and the Viennese paper Der Standard. From 1982 onwards, his work appeared in more than 100 exhibitions in Poland and across Europe, and his work is held in permanent collections not only in Poland and German-speaking Europe, but also in Finland, France and Japan.\n\nTwo Guardian Review covers brought Zygmunt particular recognition. In 2003 he won second prize in the Victoria and Albert Museum illustration awards for Witness, heralding an article by Timothy Garton Ash on the border between fact and fiction. The following year he received an award by the Society of Publication Designers, New York, for Cruel Harvest, introducing a critique by Jonathan Raban of the failure of imagination evident in the invasion of Iraq.\n\nThat cover pointed to the emptiness of the western triumph with a missile and its blown-apart master, sharing between them the colours of the stars and stripes. In a 1999 interview, Zygmunt put his liking for starting from reality down to sensing that he had no direct influence on it: \"My drawings are for me the only reality I can shape and change. The other thing is the fact that I am not in the place I want to be. I start drawing and then I feel I am in my element. I catapult myself into my self-created world hoping that the reality I have created is strong enough to survive in.\"\n\nPosters for theatre and opera productions provided another natural outlet for his striking images. He also produced cartoons and prints, created installations and wrote poetry.\n\nA couple of times Zygmunt came to Britain and I had the pleasure of showing him something of the Sussex countryside near my home. At Berwick church he particularly admired the murals by the Bloomsbury artists Duncan Grant, and Vanessa and Quentin Bell.\n\nZygmunt liked to emphasise the idea of the British as islanders, separate and cussed. He would send messages referring to \"you on the island\" or to events on \"the island\". It grew into an ideal metaphor for the relationship between us and the cultures of mainland Europe. Artists such as Zygmunt wave their flags and catch our eye, compelling readers everywhere to recognise universal concerns.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Dorota, and son, Maciek.\n\n\u2022 Zygmunt Januszewski, artist, born 17 February 1956; died 12 September 2013",

    "text": "Last August, six months into her tenure as head of Anglo American Plc. (nasdaq: AAUK - news - people ), Cynthia Carroll convened a meeting of 120 executives at the Johannesburg operations headquarters of one of the world's largest mining concerns. Sitting alone on an auditorium stage facing the mostly white, insular South African group, the petite New Jersey-born geologist with a bubbly voice described Anglo's dismal safety record--15% of South Africa's 220 yearly mining deaths, all blacks.\n\n\"I will not be the chief executive of a company in which, year after year, people die on our watch,\" she declared. Carroll then announced that all of the company's South African workers would spend a day (at full pay) learning the new, enhanced safety regulations. Other safety measures soon followed.\n\nMany present considered her criticisms unfair, given Anglo's more labor-intensive, riskier mines. But the meeting--which followed several high-level executive departures Carroll orchestrated over safety issues--clearly charted a new course for the 91-year-old company.\n\nCarroll became Anglo's chief executive in March 2007. After a rocky start--Anglo's market cap had fallen $1 billion the day her appointment was announced--the U.S.-traded ADRS have gone up 68% to $37, from $22. She has benefited from share buybacks, commodities price increases and a weakening dollar (Anglo reports in British currency), as well as more efficient operations.\n\nAnglo, founded by Sir Ernest Oppenheimer with support from mining engineer Herbert Hoover and financier J.P. Morgan, had 2007 sales of $26 billion, on which it netted $7.3 billion. Anglo digs up coal, copper, nickel, iron ore and platinum. Its holdings include 45% of De Beers, the world's largest diamond-mining firm.\n\nThe first woman ever to head such a big company in the male-dominated mining industry, the 51-year-old Carroll is no bleeding-heart liberal. Yet she sometimes sounds like one when she throws around lingo like \"sustainability.\" At the company's executive offices in London she explains her recent activities as simply making good business sense. \"I have never seen a mine that is operated efficiently that also had a poor safety record,\" she says. \"Safety and efficiency go hand in hand.\"\n\nCarroll has the benefit of following a weak act. Anthony (Tony) Trahar had been running the giant miner so lethargically for seven years that Anglo began to look like a takeover target. He was spending all his time trying to unload nonmining assets that Anglo had been forced to acquire during apartheid, so the company missed the big global consolidation. Rumored suitors included the Russian alumina operator Rusal; Xstrata (other-otc: XSRAF.PK - news - people ), a Swiss commodity miner; and Rio Tinto, a major coal company.\n\nThanks to the divestitures--plus zooming commodity prices--Carroll took office with a $3 billion cash hoard to facilitate financing. She could focus on expansion, both within the company and by acquisition. Anglo is already big. Its 76% ownership of Anglo Platinum (other-otc: AGPPY.PK - news - people ) gives it 40% of the worldwide market for the element crucial to catalytic converters needed to reduce car emissions; it mines and refines 2.5 million troy ounces a year and collects $2,000-plus for each. Its 45% De Beers stake amounts to a 20% position in the diamond market. Anglo annually extracts 666,000 metric tons of copper. Anglo produces 3% of the world's seaborne output of iron ore, a share likely to grow to 10% by 2017 with the help of two recent acquisitions. In its early days Anglo was a big gold producer, but that metal is a shrinking part of its business now.\n\nAs Carroll sees it, many of the mineral assets Anglo already owned both in South Africa and elsewhere were simply not being developed. \"The best pipeline in the business,\" she calls them. So she doubled the budget for developing mining properties to $43 billion.\n\nCarroll had the luck of very good timing in her new job. Many of Anglo's commodities are in their sixth year of higher prices. How long is this boom going to last? \"The countries driving the demand are still in an expansionary mode,\" she says, referring to India and China. \"With stocks of most metals predicted to remain low, that can only mean higher prices.\" She dismisses the notion that recent consolidation in the mining industry (which includes bhp's merger with Billiton and Rusal's takeover of Sual) has contributed to price increases.\n\nBut there is a considerable moderating force to increased profits: the higher costs of extracting those commodities. \"Energy, transport and labor,\" Carroll says, rattling off a list. Plus the capital and financing expense of new mines. She figures the cost of building one new copper mine has risen by 60% in three years to perhaps $550 million. Environmental regulations bear some of the blame.\n\nFor external expansion Carroll started with a series of relatively small deals. She purchased a Brazilian iron ore business for $6.7 billion, although Anglo would also need to build a port and terminal in Rio de Janeiro before ore shipments could begin. She agreed to pay the Peruvian government $403 million over five years to work the old Michiquillay copper mine, whose lower-grade ore, near worthless when copper was 80 cents a pound, looks pretty good at $4. In the company's first U.S. deal she pledged $1.4 billion for a 50% stake in a joint venture to extract copper, gold and molybdenum from Pebble Mine in Alaska, 200 miles southwest of Anchorage.\n\nThen there's China, where Anglo had a variety of relatively small interests, such as a 60% stake in a Shaanxii Province coal mine. In a move with great potential, Anglo has signed a deal with China Development Bank, a state-owned institution with access to the country's $200 billion sovereign wealth fund. The idea here is that besides China, the bank can open doors for Anglo in Third World nations in which it has access.\n\nWhile Anglo American operates in upwards of 40 countries, nearly half the profits come from mines in South Africa, home to 80,000 of Anglo's 177,000 employees (that figure includes people working at majority-owned subsidiaries). That means Carroll had to clean up the company's relationship with the government. During the apartheid government, which ruled from 1948 until 1994, the Oppenheimer family had bravely played a leading role in the white opposition, owning antigovernment newspapers, recognizing black trade unions and even meeting with the banned African National Congress. On the other hand, Anglo continued prospering from the migrant labor system and was totally dependent on this system of institutionalized discrimination.\n\nAfter apartheid's end, Anglo's early inroads into what would become the black ruling elite dissipated. The Oppenheimers began unwinding their Anglo holdings, moving the company to London and swapping most of their shareholdings for some of Anglo's overseas assets. Today the family owns only 3.4%.\n\nA South African contingent was left in charge, and the homeland was worried that Anglo's gains from South Africa were being used to buy foreign assets, with profits going elsewhere. It didn't help in 2004 when Trahar innocently told London's Financial Times that \"political risk in South Africa is starting to diminish--although I'm not saying it has gone.\" Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela's successor at the African National Congress, shot back that Trahar was \"bad-mouthing\" the country, pointedly warning, \"It has been difficult to understand why important businesspeople would continue to hold and communicate negative views about our country.\"\n\nCarroll embraced a new South African law calling for creation of what are called Black Economic Empowerment entities. The acronym is bee--and Carroll quickly found herself being called the Queen Bee by rivals and grumbling executives, though not to her face. Last year Anglo undertook seven major bee transactions that, in addition to previous deals, sold 26% of its existing assets to historically disadvantaged South Africans. The company says these transactions involved no dilution to existing shareholders. Carroll's moves prompted the South African government in April to confirm permanent mining rights.\n\nConsidering Anglo's size, Carroll's yearly compensation is a relatively modest $3 million. She has a remarkable lack of ego or pretension. That's especially so in an industry populated with such rough and ready competitors as Brian Gilbertson, the flamboyant ex-head of the Russian aluminum company Sual who put together the 2001 merger between bhp and Billiton, and Charlie Sartain, the acquisitive boss of the Australian company Xstrata Copper, who outwitted all comers to grab Canada's Falconbridge.\n\nCarroll grew up in Princeton, N.J., as Cynthia Blum. Her stockbroker father, Frederick Blum, insisted on reading one article from the Wall Street Journal every night to his children at the dinner table, which they then discussed. But her mother, Britta Blum, recalls that Cynthia was more interested in a foreign language, French.\n\nCindy (her mother still calls her that) attended Skidmore College, in an upstate New York environment suited to horses and laid-back lifestyles. But her liberal arts ambition changed during her freshman year, when, to satisfy a science requirement, she took geology and, she says, found she \"absolutely loved\" the field. While she was at college, her father's firm, in which he had become a partner, ran into financial problems, leaving the family strapped. A family friend helped fund Carroll's education.",

    "text": "Even centuries later, there remains one big mystery about Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s life: When is his birthday? Though his last words were well recorded when he died on Mar. 26, 1827, the other end of his life was much more obscure. The date of his birth is often supposed to be Dec. 16, 1770, and his baptism was on the following day\u2014245 years ago Thursday.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot we do know about Beethoven, and one of the most commonly known facts is that, by the end of his life, the world\u2019s most famous musical genius couldn\u2019t hear his own work.\n\nInterest in Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss has long captivated his fans, many of whom are fascinated by the tragic circumstances of a deaf composer and the ways Beethoven managed to keep working even after he completely lost his hearing by the time he was 45. As TIME once described it, \u201cby clenching a stick in his teeth, holding it against the keyboard of his piano, he could discern faint sounds.\u201d\n\nHe even introduced the world to what remains perhaps his most famous composition\u2014the Ninth Symphony\u2014well after deafness had overtaken him, an irony that produced one of the most poignant moments of his career, as TIME noted in 1932:\n\nThree years before Ludwig van Beethoven shook his great fist at the thunder & lightning raging outside his window and fell back dead on his bed, his Ninth (last) Symphony was given its first performance in Vienna. Beethoven, a homely, dumpy, shaggy-headed little figure, stood in the orchestra, eyes fixed on his score, awkwardly beating time. He was not the official conductor. The players had been instructed to pay him no attention. He was so deaf by that time that he could hear nothing of the great, surging music called for by the pinny, almost illegible little notes he had made. He did not sense the applause which came afterwards until one of the soloists, a Fraulein Caroline Unger, turned him around so that his eyes could take it in. The music passed into the background then. The demonstration took a sudden, emotional turn as the people started shouting, beating their palms together still harder in an effort to assure the fierce-looking little man of their sympathy, their appreciation.\n\nThat appreciation did nothing to lift the melancholy that had settled on Beethoven by then. Though he would joke about his other ailments, his letters later revealed to the world that his hearing problems only left him depressed, isolated from society and afraid that he was being taken advantage of. \u201cMy poor hearing haunted me everywhere like a ghost; and I have avoided all human society,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cI seem a misanthrope and yet am far from being one.\u201d\n\nYet his hearing loss and the way he coped with it in daily life has helped preserve his story for the ages.\n\nBecause he used a notebook to conduct conversations with friends, family and colleagues, the written records of those conversations could be maintained. The transcripts are often one-sided, as he would still respond to many questions verbally, but \u201cthey make clear what Beethoven was thinking about,\u201d TIME noted when the \u2018conversation notebooks\u2019 were released in the 1970s, \u201cand where he occasionally wrote in the books himself\u2014usually for a comment that he did not want others in the room to overhear\u2014the blunt style is unmistakable. Nephew Karl brings home a somewhat seedy friend, and Beethoven jots down: \u2018I don\u2019t like your choice of this friend at all. Poverty deserves sympathy, but not without exceptions.'\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, a few American fans of his purchased a lock of Beethoven\u2019s hair at an auction for the purpose of examining the medical data preserved within, hoping to find out once and for all whether his deafness was really, as had been long supposed, caused by use of mercury as treatment for syphilis. That lock of hair is kept at San Jos\u00e9 State University, and as of 2000 no tell-tale mercury had been found.\n\nRead more about Beethoven\u2019s birthday: You Have to Try This Google Doodle Honoring Ludwig van Beethoven\n\nRead an assessment of Beethoven on the 200th anniversary of his death, here in the TIME Vault: 200-Condlepower",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) -- The Senate voted unanimously Wednesday to confirm Gen. David Petraeus as the new top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan -- an unusual display of bipartisan unity in the politically divisive conflict.\n\nPetraeus was tapped by President Barack Obama to replace Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who was relieved of his duties last week after the general and his staff were quoted in a Rolling Stone magazine article criticizing and mocking key administration officials.\n\nThe brief debate over Petraeus' nomination focused largely on Obama's plan to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan in July 2011. Key Democrats insisted the date is necessary to force the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai to assume more responsibility in the war against Islamic extremists. Republicans contended the date has emboldened the enemy and dissuaded potential allies from fighting alongside U.S. and other coalition forces.\n\nPetraeus told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday in his confirmation hearing that he supports the drawdown date, but also insisted it should be \"based on conditions on the ground.\" He said the U.S. military and insurgents are in \"a test of wills.\"\n\nPetraeus said he views the date \"most importantly as the message of urgency to accompany the message of enormous (increased U.S.) commitment.\"\n\nObama announced in December a commitment of an additional 30,000 U.S. forces, a tripling of the number of U.S. civilians in Afghanistan, and funding for another 100,000 Afghan security personnel.\n\nDuring his hearing, Petraeus pointed to Obama's recent reminder that \"July 2011 will mark the beginning of a process, not the date when the U.S. heads for the exits and turns out the lights.\" He quoted Obama as saying, \"We'll need to provide assistance to Afghanistan for a long time to come.\"\n\n\"Moreover, as President Karzai has recognized, and as a number of allied leaders noted at the recent G-20 summit, it is going to be a number of years before Afghan forces can truly handle the security tasks in Afghanistan on their own,\" he said.\n\nPetraeus also repeated a pledge to review strict rules of engagement designed to minimize civilian casualties. The rules have been criticized by some observers as increasing the level of risk to U.S. soldiers.\n\nI am \"keenly aware of concerns by some of our troops on the ground about the application of our rules of engagement and the tactical directive,\" Petraeus said. \"They should know that I will look very hard at this issue.\"\n\nPetraeus said that \"recent months in Afghanistan have seen tough fighting and tough casualties.\" But \"this was expected,\" he asserted. \"The going inevitably gets tougher before it gets easier when a counterinsurgency operation tries to reverse insurgent momentum.\"\n\n\"My sense is that the tough fighting will continue,\" he warned. \"Indeed, it may get more intense in the next few months. As we take away the enemy's safe havens and reduce the enemy's freedom of action, the insurgents will fight back.\"\n\nMost popular stories right now",

    "text": "BERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 We spend a great deal of time worrying about theology these days. From extremist violence to the American culture wars, the theological imagination can feel like an existential threat to liberal democracy. Or more simply, just to common decency. No surprise that many believe that theology has no place in the secular college classroom.\n\nOver the years, I have decided that this is wrong. I learned to think otherwise teaching Calvin in California.\n\nGiven my profession, I am naturally curious about theology. But it takes collaborative work in the classroom to persuade students that they should be, too. To persuade them that theology is more than its bad press; that it is a rich subject as likely to provoke disbelief as belief; that it is more likely to open than to close interesting conversations about religion and public life. To persuade them, in short, that theology matters to a liberal education.\n\nIn my history of Christianity course, we read a number of challenging writers. Each one I ask students to read with as much sympathy, charity and critical perspective as they can muster. But nothing outrages them \u2014 not the writings of Augustine or Erasmus or Luther \u2014 more than two or three pages of John Calvin.\n\nCalvin was the most influential religious reformer of the 16th century. His theological imagination and organizational genius prepared the way for almost all forms of American Protestantism, from the Presbyterians to the Methodists to the Baptists. He was also a severe and uncompromising thinker. The Ayatollah of Geneva, some have called him.\n\nLate in the third book of his 1559 \u201cInstitutes of the Christian Religion\u201d \u2014 when he seeks to describe the utter power of God over man, and our utter dependence on Him \u2014 is usually where my students revolt. These young people come from all walks of life. They are atheists, agnostics, Christians, Jews, Muslims and more besides. They are the face of California diversity, young people with wildly different social, religious, ethnic and racial experiences.\n\nDiverse as they may be, their reaction is the same when they read a sentence like this: \u201cSome are born destined for certain death from the womb, who glorify God\u2019s name by their own destruction.\u201d This is the heart of Calvin\u2019s teaching of predestination, his insistence that God determined each human destiny before the creation of the world. The elect are bound for heaven, the reprobate to hell, and there is absolutely nothing to be done about it, ever. \u201cJacob is chosen and distinguished from the rejected Esau, by God\u2019s predestination, while not differing from him in merits,\u201d is how Calvin put it. Your merits, your good will, your moral action: None of these make a difference. The chosen Jacob is no better than the rejected Esau. The damned glorify God\u2019s name. And God is pleased by the whole business.\n\nThe classroom erupts in protest. Nothing has prepared my students for an idea like this. Secular students object: How can so much arrogant misanthropy pass itself off as piety? Non-Christian students are agitated, too. What kind of God is this, they ask, that took pleasure in creating man so that he might be condemned to everlasting damnation? And the various types of Christian students are no less outraged. \u201cFollow me,\u201d Christ said, and doesn\u2019t that mean that we are asked to choose, that the choice between death and salvation is a free one? All different concerns, but the outcome is the same: rejection, usually disgust.\n\nI ask the students to read on. After all, Calvin anticipated these objections, since they were raised in his day, too. He dedicated a whole chapter to dismissing the \u201cinsolence\u201d of the human understanding when it \u201chears these things.\u201d He knew that our first reactions would be anger and denial, that we would be baffled by predestination. So he demanded that his readers, then and now, think alongside him. His argument goes like this: If God alone created all things, doesn\u2019t that mean that he did so freely? If he is free in his choices, how can it be otherwise than that God himself determines our fates, right to the edges of hell? Once you grant the first premise \u2014 that there is no God besides God and that he made the universe \u2014 reason itself apparently requires we assent to this terrible thought.\n\nNone of the students are persuaded by Calvin\u2019s logic. But again, Calvin probably knew that they wouldn\u2019t be, since many of his own readers weren\u2019t either. For this saying \u201cno,\u201d the rejection of this terrible idea, is a natural, even reasonable reaction. \u201cMonstrous indeed is the madness of men, who desire to subject the immeasurable to the puny measure of their own reason,\u201d Calvin exclaimed.\n\nHuman reason seeks to subject God to itself, but predestination tells us that we cannot. Reasoning itself needs to come to an end before humans can experience the proper relationship to God.\n\nHere we can see something special about the theological reasoning that Calvin practiced. This is not philosophy, after all. His work is not aimed at an abstract audience. Instead it is a direct address to you. Confronting the doctrine of predestination is a kind of psychological experiment. Nothing else can \u201csuffice to make us as humble as we ought to be\u201d as \u201ca taste of this doctrine\u201d of predestination, as Calvin put it. Exactly here, in this rejection and anger, Calvin insists, you finally feel in your gut the greatness of God. You finally feel the difference between his Majesty and your limitation.\n\nBelievers in the classroom feel the bite of this argument in their own ways, often struggling to keep the first premise but to deny what seems to follow from it. Even the students who don\u2019t believe any of this, though, can feel the power of the argument, if only in the disgust that it fosters in them. Of course you feel disgusted, Calvin would say, that\u2019s exactly how an atheist should react!\n\nThe experience of reading Calvin has unexpected lessons, then, for religious and secular students alike. The first lesson that Calvin teaches us is about the power of an idea, uncompromisingly expressed and shrewdly argued. I tell the students that their reactions were shared by generations of European theologians and philosophers. In the late 17th century, for example, the German philosopher and co-inventor of the calculus Gottfried Leibniz coined the word \u201ctheodicy\u201d and wrote the first comprehensive philosophical defense of God\u2019s justice to manage the \u201chorror\u201d all good people feel at the thought that God by choice saves so few \u201cand abandons all others to the devil his enemy, who torments them eternally and makes them curse their Creator.\u201d\n\nAnd so students learn that they are not alone in feeling the terribleness of Calvin\u2019s challenge. Indeed, that they find it terrible at all (and not just irrelevant or bizarre) already puts them into the very conversation with the past that a history classroom hopes to forge. In their reactions, they are already participating in the intellectual revolutions of the modern world.\n\nThe second lesson Calvin teaches us, secular and religious, is this: Be careful what you believe in. Consider the consequences of your commitments. Investigate what your own views demand. These are lessons neither of secular reason nor of Christian reason. They are lessons about reasoning itself. Once we begin to talk at this level, what results are powerful conversations about powerful questions that cut across religious and secular life. Do we think that the world has a purpose and an order? If it does, where do they come from? If it doesn\u2019t, what does a meaningful life look like? If we believe in a God, where does that belief drive us? If we don\u2019t, what kinds of commitments do we actually have?\n\nCalvin was certainly no liberal, but these are questions that the liberal arts classroom was designed to nurture. His theology spurs secular and religious students to discuss issues of common concern, to delineate differences and similarities, to build a community of inquiry.\n\nThe third lesson is this: that we don\u2019t need to take Calvin\u2019s bait. Religious and secular students both come to this on their own, examining Calvin\u2019s text more deeply than perhaps even he did. Look at this sentence, one says: \u201cAll those who do not know that they are God\u2019s own will be miserable through constant fear.\u201d But how is anyone supposed to know that she is God\u2019s own, she asks? If we feel humiliated and bereft of reason, how are we supposed to feel certain? And what kind of society would this produce, this lack of certainty, this humiliation?",

    "text": "Peter de Francia: The Ship of Fools, notable for the poignancy of the artist's imagery, 'even as it comments excoriatingly on human frailty'. Photograph: Pallant House\n\nIn 1959 Peter de Francia painted The Bombing of Sakiet, a canvas roughly 6ft high by 12ft wide, that has frequently been referred to as his Guernica. It was his response to the killing of 79 villagers in Tunisia where, the French authorities claimed, Algerian insurrectionists were trained.\n\nComparison to Picasso's masterpiece is obviously far-fetched, despite the scope of De Francia's ambition and achievement, but it gives a measure of the times. Far from being the backwater that is casually assumed, as the mists of war drifted away, the 1950s in British art was a decade seething with invention and riven by faction, political and artistic, in which the currency was not Warhol's percipient notion of 15 minutes of fame, but ideas freely and vehemently exchanged between continental Europe and Britain, and between British realists and abstractionists.\n\nAs it happens, De Francia, who has died aged 90 of pneumonia after a long spell as a diabetic, was well placed to be a combatant. A committed socialist, involved in the birth of the Universities and Left Review (soon to merge with the New Reasoner and become the New Left Review), he was born in Beaulieu, on the C\u00f4te d'Azur near the border with Italy. His father, Laurent Fernand de Francia, was a lawyer from a wealthy Genoese family, and his mother, Alice Groom, was English. De Francia grew up multilingual, studying in Paris first at the Lyc\u00e9e Pascale and then at the American high school.\n\nHe had a firsthand knowledge of postwar Italian art. In 1947 he worked in the studio of the communist Renato Guttuso, the leading socialist-realist painter, returned to Italy for two years in 1949, had a circle of Italian artist friends, and held a couple of shows in Milan.\n\nHis course had been set in 1939, following the death of his father. De Francia went to Brussels to study at the arts academy: when the Nazis invaded the following year, he got on his bike and pedalled to the coast through fields to avoid roads blocked with refugees going south and allied troops going north. In England, his mother's greeting was: \"Why haven't you shaved?\"\n\nHe joined the British army, was transferred from anti-tank artillery to interpreting photographs of the Normandy coast which, being half French, he was presumed to know intimately, and after D-day served in Belgium. Once the war was over he went to the Slade School of Art in London.\n\nAs late as 1977 the critic Richard Cork wrote: \"Despite the prominence Peter de Francia commands as professor of painting at the Royal College of Art, his work is a more or less unknown quantity to everyone outside close friends and colleagues.\" The occasion for Cork's remarks was De Francia's big solo show at Camden Arts Centre. The reasons for the previous semi-obscurity were diverse, but included the fall from favour of the leftwing of De Francia himself and others of the order of John Berger, the sculptor George Fullard, the illustrator Paul Hogarth, the scientist JD Bernal and the cartoonist Abu (Abu Abraham). Another and more pertinent reason was that De Francia, neither communist nor fellow traveller, was an intellectual in the French sense, actively engaged with ideas and politics, reviewing, writing books (including a major study of Fernand L\u00e9ger), broadcasting successfully on art and becoming a talks producer for BBC Television.\n\nYet he had shows all round the world; latterly and fittingly, three exhibitions at James Hyman Fine Art, the gallery run by the author of a key book on the period, The Battle for Realism; and he combined this with teaching in several art schools, including the RCA, where in 1980 the new rector, Dickie Guyatt, invited De Francia to step down from his professorship. De Francia refused, Guyatt sent in the lawyers, and the painting school rose, young and old, passed a motion of no confidence in Guyatt and the administration, and won the day for De Francia.\n\nHis work remained combative and brilliant. He was an agile draughtsman and beautiful colourist, but the clincher is the poignancy of his imagery even as it comments excoriatingly on human frailty, as in The Ship of Fools, a painting from around 1972 in the Pallant House collection at Chichester. The Battle of Sakiet, on extended loan from the Tunisian Embassy, is in the current hang at Tate Modern. Apart from Guernica, it has echoes of the wrecked warplanes of Paul Nash's Dead Sea, and even of Hogarth \u2013 an infant falling headlong from its mother's arms \u2013 but mostly its inspiration was the memory of German Stukas dive bombing during De Francia's rural bike ride through Belgium.\n\nDe Francia's first marriage, in 1943, ended in divorce; the second, to Jenny Franklin in 1980, was dissolved in 1988; the third was to Alix MacSweeney in 2004. She survives him.\n\n\u2022 Peter Laurent de Francia, artist, born 25 January 1921; died 19 January 2012\n\n\u2022 Peter de Francia on the BBC Your Paintings website",

    "text": "The \"Fast & Furious\" scandal is getting messier and messier. New e-mails finally released late this past Friday reveal that the Department of Justice personal viewed the then-secret operation as a way to push for more gun control laws. Despite administration promises to the contrary, whistleblowers have endured \"isolation, retaliation and transfer.\"\n\nMeanwhile the operation's managers have done pretty well, some have even received promotions.\n\nThursday Attorney General Eric Holder admitted that the operation was \"wholly unacceptable,\" but he still offers absolutely no explanation to explain why the program was instituted.\n\nWhat's going on here? Let's see...\n\n- You have a government agency ordering gun dealers to make sales to suspected criminals that the dealers didn't want to sell to.\n\n- You have government agents testifying that the being purchased were not being traced. No attempt was made to even alert the Mexican government that the United States of America was given guns to drug gangs in their country.\n\nUp until now the only justification from the Obama administration for this \"program\" is that the Bush administration supposedly did the same thing with operation \"Wide Receiver.\"\n\nIn fact, it is a defense that the Justice Department and Congressional Democrats have raise multiple times. Congressman Elijah Cummings' office just made this defense on Wednesday.\n\nBut the \"Fast & Furious\" and \"Wide Receiver\" programs are not remotely similar on the most important fact: The Bush administration tried to trace the guns and informed the Mexican authorities when the guns went across the border, but the Obama administration did not.\n\nAnd it is well-known how ineffective tracing programs have been anyway.\n\nThe problem is that if \"Wide Receiver\" failed in tracing the guns and was subsequently shutdown, why is the solution to not even bother to try tracing the firearms? Holder's conclusion in testimony before Congress was simply: \"Guns lost during this operation will continue to show up at crime scenes on both sides of the border.\"\n\nWould Holder have been as forgiving if a gun dealer had been caught intentionally doing the same thing that the Obama administration has been caught doing?\n\nThe new e-mails documenting Justice Department discussions on the political benefits from the \"Fast & Furious\" program are disturbing and they are only going to give more ammunition to conspiracy theorists for why the Obama administration instituted the program to begin with.\n\nPeople who haven't trusted the Obama administration on this issue have already pointed out that \"Fast & Furious\" started pushing guns into Mexico at the same time that the Obama administration was making its inaccurate claims about the United States being a major source of Mexican crime guns.\n\nThe new internal messages reveal that in early January this year, a month before there was any publicity about \"Fast & Furious,\" Department of Justice personnel were pointing out: \"this case [\"Fast & Furious] could be a strong supporting factor [for new regulations] if we can determine how many multiple sales of long guns occurred during the course of this case.\"\n\nMore evidence has also surfaced showing how uncomfortable gun dealers were in selling these guns that they didn't want to sell. One dealer wrote BATF officials in April 2010: \"[W]e were hoping to put together something like a letter of understanding to alleviate concerns of some type of recourse against us down the road for selling these items. We just want to make sure we are cooperating with ATF and that we are not viewed as selling to the bad guys.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Holders' testimony Thursday didn't make things any clearer. His definition of \"lying\" depending on one's state of mind sounded positively Clintonian.\n\nBut ultimately the Obama administration still faces a bigger problem. Can they ever come up with any remotely plausible explanation for why anyone would have started a program to push untraceable guns into Mexico? The longer it takes to provide an explanation, the more plausible the conspiracy theorists sound that this was all done for politics.",

    "text": "BARTLESVILLE, Okla. \u2014 T. W. Shannon will be Oklahoma\u2019s first black senator if he wins the Republican nomination and is elected this November, but the quiet campaign stirring here about Mr. Shannon\u2019s racial loyalties is not aimed at the African-American branch of his family tree.\n\nMr. Shannon, whose first name is Tahrohon, is a member of the Chickasaw Nation, the most influential tribe in a state where Native Americans are not merely the inheritors of a poignant history but also collectively constitute the state\u2019s largest nongovernment employer outside of Walmart.\n\nMost of those jobs are connected to Oklahoma\u2019s 110-and-counting casinos, which are becoming as familiar here as oil derricks. Yet the gambling revenue that has showered millions on some of the state\u2019s Native Americans has also bred resentment over the tribes\u2019 expanding footprint. Now, as Mr. Shannon vies to make history, he has become both the political beneficiary of the tribes\u2019 newfound wealth and a target for complaints about Native American sovereignty and possible competing loyalties.\n\nIf he can earn the Republican nomination in Oklahoma\u2019s June primary, T.W. Shannon could be the second enrolled Native American elected to the United States Senate in nearly 100 years.\n\nCredit By A.J. Chavar on Publish Date May 3, 2014\n\nBeyond Oklahoma, Mr. Shannon, a 36-year-old former State House speaker, has the potential to become a sensation in a party desperate to shed its old-and-white image. Some prominent conservatives have embraced his candidacy.\n\nWhile identity politics \u2014 about race, religion or gender \u2014 has been a defining element of both parties for generations, Mr. Shannon adds a rare dimension. And he says he is uneasy about being the latest emblem of Republican diversity.\n\nMr. Shannon, whose father is Chickasaw and mother is black, would be only the second enrolled tribal member to join the Senate in nearly 100 years; Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado was first, in 1993. Mr. Shannon has received tens of thousands of dollars directly from Chickasaws and other tribes. And an independent group, Oklahomans for a Conservative Future, has already spent over $435,000 on his behalf since March. The group has received contributions from Indians, according to Republicans familiar with the donors who were not authorized to speak for the group.\n\nAs he has emerged as a formidable candidate to win the seat held by Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican who is retiring, Mr. Shannon also has prompted a revival of old grudges about citizenship and identity.\n\n\u201cBtw, the Indians aren\u2019t Oklahomans,\u201d Robert Dan Robbins, a rancher and prominent supporter of Mr. Shannon\u2019s chief primary opponent, Representative James Lankford, wrote on his own Facebook page. \u201cThey are a member of their own nation and are suing the state of Oklahoma over water rights and other things as well.\u201d\n\nA Tea Party group, in an open letter about Mr. Shannon, warned, \u201cHe has too many masters to serve,\u201d and listed \u201cIndian tribes\u201d and Representative Tom Cole, a fellow Chickasaw and establishment-oriented Oklahoma Republican, among his suspect influences.\n\nUnlike many states with significant Indian populations, Oklahoma before statehood was made up of Indian territories, and members of its tribes are culturally integrated and do not live on reservations.\n\nStill, tensions that stem from the tribes\u2019 unique status are evident. \u201cWhen someone says that Indians aren\u2019t real Oklahomans I guess they forgot that Oklahoma is Choctaw for \u2018red people,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Cole, neutral in the race but a mentor to Mr. Shannon, who was once his driver. \u201cLook, Indians have been here long before anybody else, and most of them didn\u2019t exactly come here by choice.\u201d\n\nMr. Shannon is more cautious when discussing his background. In an interview after an early-morning Rotary Club visit in this small, northeastern Oklahoma town, best known as the ancestral home of Phillips 66, he emphasized that he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of his heritage, while carefully noting that it does not define him entirely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an American first, and that\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d said Mr. Shannon, who was first elected to the State House of Representatives in 2006.\n\nSuch efforts at reassurance \u2014 along with ads like the one promoting legislation he sponsored requiring that welfare recipients work \u2014 may be necessary in a state that bears such history as the Trail of Tears. But Oklahoma, at the geographic and cultural intersection of the Great Plains, the South and the West, is the same state that once elected African-American, Native American, Jewish, Catholic and Mormon candidates to high office in the same year, two decades ago.\n\nThe African-American elected in 1994 was J. C. Watts, a former University of Oklahoma quarterback who became the Republican Party\u2019s highest-profile black official as a member of Congress. Mr. Shannon recalled advice from Mr. Watts, who told him, \u201cIf you make it your issue, if you make it the focus of your campaign, then it will be.\u201d His racial background, Mr. Shannon said, \u201cis just one part of my experience \u2014 it\u2019s not the defining moment.\u201d\n\nSo Mr. Shannon is not just seeking to put the state\u2019s deeply conservative Republican primary electorate at ease and pre-empt a nascent whispering campaign. He also wants to be something more than a handy symbol at a moment when his party\u2019s crippling lack of success among nonwhites and the presence of the first black president have made race central to the country\u2019s politics.\n\nBut that may not be easy.\n\n\u201cHis name alone!\u201d Sarah Palin exclaimed at a large, nearly all-white rally of supporters for Mr. Shannon in Tulsa last month. \u201cThe Democrats accuse us of not embracing diversity? Oh, my goodness, he is \u2014 he\u2019s it. He is the whole package.\u201d\n\nBut other conservatives are plainly uncomfortable with such tactics. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who was also at the rally, said in an interview, \u201cRather than engage in identity politics and smear campaigns, which is the specialty, sadly, of the modern Democratic Party, we ought to be discussing how to turn this country around.\u201d\n\nYet the statement that Mr. Shannon\u2019s election would make is much on the minds of Oklahoma Republicans, some of whom think he could pierce stereotypes about their state and party.\n\n\u201cWe need people that can relate to the average American, and the average American is not the average American from 1955,\u201d said State Senator David Holt, a Republican. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to project a face from your party that reflects America, and America is changing.\u201d\n\nThere is also something compelling about the prospect of elevating a native son who made his name here, and not beyond Oklahoma\u2019s borders, as did a long list of exports including Mickey Mantle, Jim Thorpe, Ralph Ellison and Woody Guthrie.\n\nMr. Lankford, the most formidable other Republican in the race, recognizes Mr. Shannon\u2019s symbolic appeal and is moving to frame the question in his own terms. \u201cWhat are Oklahomans looking for?\u201d Mr. Lankford said in an interview. \u201cAre they looking to have a celebrity, or are they looking for somebody to be able to solve their problems?\u201d\n\nBut, chatting in a Tulsa coffee shop just up the road from a Creek Nation casino, Mr. Lankford acknowledged that the financial backing Mr. Shannon had received from the tribes had given his opponent a boost.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been pretty clear that they want to have a tribal member in the Senate,\u201d said Mr. Lankford, a member of the House leadership who led a large Baptist summer camp in his heavily Baptist state before going to Washington in 2010.\n\nFormer Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican, said: \u201cYou\u2019ll have the Baptists embracing Lankford and the tribes embracing Shannon. That\u2019s quite a tug of war between two redwoods.\u201d\n\nOklahomans for a Conservative Future, the group advertising on Mr. Shannon\u2019s behalf, is structured under a section of the tax code that does not require disclosure of its donors. An official with the group would not discuss the identities of its donors, but people familiar with the contributions acknowledged that it had received tribal money.\n\nIt is one of the first measures of Native Americans gaining political strength, a role likely to endure whether or not Mr. Shannon wins.\n\n\u201cMost people didn\u2019t worry about the Indians in part because they were everywhere, they sort of looked like everybody else, they sort of lived like everybody else,\u201d said Keith Gaddie, a University of Oklahoma political science professor. \u201cNobody cared about Native Americans until they got money.\u201d",

    "text": "Of the two major-party presidential candidates, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, who is better at solving problems? And what sort of problems should the candidates be seeking to solve, anyway?\n\nIn the first part of this series, we noted the remarkably even-steven division of power between the two parties, a phenomenon commonly described as \u201cgridlock,\u201d or \u201cpolarization.\u201d That is, each party is able to block the ambitions of the other, because neither can win a steady majority. And so, for example, while the Republicans won in 2004, they lost in 2006 and 2008, then won again in 2010. It\u2019s no wonder that nothing gets done by the party in power at the moment--because the opposition party thinks, not without reason, that all it has to do is wait for another election.\n\nIn the second part of this series, we noted that as the Democratic and Republican parties have become increasingly ideological--that is, Democrats more liberal, Republicans more conservative--it\u2019s possible to identify three possible \u201cthird parties\u201d in the US. These notional \u201cparties\u201d we dubbed \u201cEstablishment,\u201d \u201cPopulist,\u201d and \u201cProblem-Solver\u201d; they represent informal groupings, not to be confused with, say, the actual Libertarian Party or the Green Party.\n\nYet whereas the Libertarians and Greens are tiny in numbers--never having exceeded 2.6 percent of the presidential vote in either of their respective histories, and usual getting much less--these new imaginary parties are numerically important, because they sit in the middle of American politics, occupying roughly two-fifths of the electorate.\n\nStill, for all their general centrism, they are each decidedly different: The Establishment Party, focused mostly on good-government reforms, is not itself numerous in terms of votes, but boasts affluence and influence; the Populist Party, focused on middle- and working-class economic and social issues, is numerous but not affluent; the Problem-Solver Party is technologically adept, but economically and culturally diverse.\n\nThus political attention must be paid to these three \u201cparties,\u201d because neither Democrats nor Republicans can win with just their own ideological base. According to Gallup, only 21 percent of Americans define themselves as \u201cliberal,\u201d while 41 percent define themselves as \u201cconservative\u201d; these ratios have held steady for decades. So as we can see, neither party can get to the magic number of 50 plus 1 merely on the strength of its own core group; they both need a slice of the nearly 40 percent of voters who label themselves as \u201cmoderate.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans, to be sure, would seem to have an electoral edge, insofar as conservatives are at 41 percent, not so far from 50. And yet in the 2008 presidential election, that nine-point gap was a gap too far for the GOP; John McCain earned the votes of just a fraction of swing voters, totaling only 45.7 percent in the November election. By contrast, Obama won 52.9 percent of the vote; obviously, the vast bulk of moderates-in-the-middle joined with liberals in support of the Democrat.\n\nOkay, so now let\u2019s talk about the two presidential candidates in 2012, considering how they might fare this November in gaining the votes of the three middle \u201cparties.\u201d (As for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and others who might end up on the presidential ballot, in Part Two we noted that their extremely ideological views have been effectively co-opted by the intensifying ideologies of Democrats, on one side, and Republicans, on the other.)\n\nObama, we can say, is a liberal, even a leftist, who nevertheless managed to win the support of most Establishmentarians in 2008. Obama emerged from the liberal academic enclaves of Columbia, Harvard, and the University of Chicago, where he embraced familiar left-wing positions on, for example, gun control.\n\nIn addition to his tenure in ivory towers, Obama put in time as a community organizer and as a plaintiff\u2019s attorney; there\u2019s no doubt as to his bona fides as a longtime left-liberal. And after 2004, he went on to compile the most liberal voting record of all senators during his brief stint in the upper legislative chamber. Most recently, his \u201cevolution\u201d on gay marriage guarantees him a permanent place in the pantheon of progressivism.\n\nSo yes, Obama has more than nailed down the liberal vote--all 21 percent of it. And yet how did he manage to get 53 percent of the national vote four years ago? And why is he running even or better with Romney in the current RealClearPolitics poll of polls?\n\nThe answer is that Obama has been skilled at seeming not only moderate, but positively Establishmentarian; everyone in politics remembers, for example, his July 2004 speech to the Democratic National Convention in Boston, in which he declared, \u201cThere is not a liberal America and a conservative America...We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\u201d\n\nEstablishmentarians, by their nature, pride themselves on taking the \u201c30,000 foot\u201d view of issues; that is, if agreement can be found on big things--the deficit, global warming, poverty--then the little things will take care of themselves.\n\nFor his part, Obama obviously enjoys being in the company of such Establishmentarians as Warren Buffett and George Clooney, who see America from the vantage point of their private jets. However, after a challenging three-and-a-half years in office, the president no longer has the full allegiance of the Establishment Party.\n\nMoreover, Obama\u2019s romance with the Establishmentarians has come at the expense of support from the two other two \u201cparties\u201d; Obama doesn\u2019t spend much time around Populists, nor does he seem to share any of their views. In addition, he seems little interested in technology-minded Problem-Solvers; one of the few nuts-and-bolts business leaders whom he sought to cultivate, GE\u2019s Jeff Immelt, is reportedly now supporting Romney.\n\nNext we come to Obama\u2019s challenger, who is an Establishmentarian, to be sure, but also a Problem-Solver.\n\nWhat Romney does not seem to be is any kind ideological conservative.\n\nNobody thinks he made his way through Harvard Business School, Bain Capital, the Salt Lake City Olympics, and the Boston statehouse on the strength of his readings of Edmund Burke, Ayn Rand, or Milton Friedman.\n\nIn terms of his history in private and public life--leaving out, for example, such not-insignificant personal matters as his marriage to the same woman for 43 years, and being the patriarch of a tight-knit and intensely loyal family--there\u2019s little, if anything, that stamps him as a Goldwater-Reagan \u201cmovement conservative.\u201d Indeed, as governor of Massachusetts, he signed a \u201cMassachusetts Gay/Straight Youth Pride Day\u201d declaration, took credit because \u201cMassachusetts is tops in the nation for connecting needy families with food stamps,\u201d and, of course, signed a personal health insurance mandate into law.\n\nBy virtue of wealth and power, Romney is an automatic member of the Establishment Party, and he has shown no interest in leaving its ranks. But Romney seems, even more, to be an instinctive Problem-Solver. Here\u2019s how Romney\u2019s eldest son, Tagg, once described his father:\n\nIn his spare time, he wants to solve problems. When he comes over to your house, he wants to figure out, \u201cWell, your boiler\u2019s not working. How are we going to fix the boiler?\u201d and \u201cHave you noticed that some of your trees are dying out there? Why are your trees dying? What\u2019s causing that? Can we figure that out, and can we go down to the hardware store and see if they\u2019ve got something to fix that?\u201d And all of a sudden you see him driving a tractor in your backyard, and he\u2019s pulling stuff up. He's like, \u201cOh, these rocks were doing that.\u201d I mean, that\u2019s just who he is.\n\nAdmittedly, the younger Romney is not an unbiased observer, but Tagg\u2019s choice of words is still revealing. Of all the ways for the son to descriptively praise his father, the son chose to portray him as a doer and a tinkerer. And after four years of Obama, the country might well be ready for some business-like problem-solving.\n\nAh, but what about Bain Capital? What about the \u201cKing of Bain,\u201d and all that? The Obama campaign is already hitting Romney on parts of his record, but the Romney campaign has the makings of an effective response: That is, let\u2019s judge the sum total of Romney\u2019s investments with Bain versus the sum total of Obama\u2019s \u201cinvestments\u201d using federal money. In other words, Romney is saying, if Democrats choose to re-categorize most, if not all, government spending as an \u201cinvestment,\u201d let\u2019s see how those investments have actually netted out. So yes, let\u2019s compare Obama the problem-solver to Romney the problem-solver--and then let our notional Problem-Solving party judge the results.\n\nLet\u2019s consider just one issue: the scandal at the General Services Administration (GSA). We all remember the uproar when bureaucrats were found to have spent nearly a million dollars on a Las Vegas party for 300 people, complete with a clown and a mind-reader.\n\nThe Obama administration knew about these shenanigans for at least a year before they become public, and yet, since the revelations, the Obamans have fired only a few top dogs and left it at that; plenty of federal employees in the video are not still on the job, if not necessarily working.\n\nThe GSA scandal has caused no larger executive-branch consideration of how Uncle Sam spends money. Moreover, few, if any, believe that Obama is so skilled an executive that he is, even now, devising a reform plan for preventing such scandals from happening in the future. That is, Obama has shown himself to be an ineffectual problem-solver.\n\nFor their part, Congressional Republicans have been attacking GSA, and with good reason. Yet thoughtful observers, such as Paul Light of New York University, have said that the GSA\u2019s problems won\u2019t get fixed with showy hearings:\n\nWe never fixed the core problems before because they\u2019re boring. It\u2019s much more fun to haul in the clown in front of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and ask, \u201cSo, what did you do for your $8,000?\u201d\n\nIn other words, it is all too easy for Members of Congress to criticize the problem, without seeking to solve the problem.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats and their allies in the media are not without their own counter-attacking resources. \u201cThe Most Outrageous Clowns Are in Congress,\u201d blared an April headline Bloomberg View, suggesting that critics of GSA on Capitol Hill are in no position to throw stones. If Democrats can turn up the volume on the \u201ceverybody does it\u201d mantra, the GSA scandal will recede into just another chapter in the bulging bureaucratic book of ignominy.\n\nSo what could Romney do about GSA? How could he apply his own skill set to this matter?\n\nHe could start by reflecting on the original mission of the GSA, as opposed to what it does in its current bureaucratic incarnation. Created back in 1949, GSA, which counts more than 12,500 employees and a budget of almost $21 billion, theoretically oversees federal purchases across the whole of the government. So today, how does one update the mission of a 20th century agency into an appropriate mission for the 21st century?\n\nMoreover, in light of Romney\u2019s background, what would a Bain Capital approach to fixing the agency look like?\n\nIt would be more than just slashing the budget or its employees, because, as we know, a dysfunctional agency with a reduced budget is still a dysfunctional agency. What\u2019s needed is a replacement model that fulfills necessary functions, even as it taps into the latest technological efficiencies. It\u2019s impossible to believe that GSA really needs 12,500 employees, but what\u2019s the right number--half that figure? a quarter? a tenth?\n\nThe only way to answer such questions is by surveying the way that leaner and smarter operations fulfill their supply needs. After all, Apple and Intel need pencils--how do they buy them? What does FedEx or UPS know about moving things around, making them intantly trackable at every step of the journey? What does Wal-Mart or Target know about keeping tabs on its worldwide inventory? And what does Google or Facebook know about the better management of information and data? It\u2019s not always the case that we can run the federal government as we would a business--but sometimes we can.\n\nThat\u2019s the case that Romney can make. He can say, \u201cI know how to do this. I have done it before, and I can do it again. Something came before the GSA, and something will come after it. So I will figure out what should come next, so that the government will run as efficiently as the best private-sector company. I am more qualified than Barack Obama to find the better way forward.\u201d If Romney can make that argument, Problem-Solvers will cheer, and the middle of the electorate will shift, abandoning the stale and ideological incumbent and moving toward the fresh and practical-minded challenger.\n\nAnd so Romney can win the election and be our 45th president.\n\nJames P.

    "text": "As big tech companies invest more resources into developing wristband wearables, HTC is getting cold feet with its own wearable plans.\n\nIn March, the company teamed up with Under Armour to built the HTC Grip. The manufacturer showed it off at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and gave it a spring launch date.\n\nBut now, HTC confirmed to Mashable that it's pulling back on shipping the product and will rework it after \"extensive wear testing and user feedback.\"\n\nThrough our partnership with Under Armour, we have continued to refine our vision and approach to the health and fitness category. Our goal is to offer best-in-class products for our customers and partners. After extensive wear testing and user feedback, we have decided to align GRIP with the entire product portfolio for health and fitness launching later this year. This will be a state-of-the-art comprehensive portfolio of products for this category powered by UA RECORD. We are excited to launch this new comprehensive product suite and will share further details as we get closer to launch.\n\nAlthough it's unclear whether or not the user feedback was positive, we can assume the company wants to make sure the Grip is a success \u2014 and if it was good as is, the launch wouldn't have been delayed.\n\nThe news, first reported by The Verge, could be a wise move for the company. There are countless wristband wearables on the market but only a few (including Fitbit and Jawbone) with a loyal following and strong market share.\n\nHTC's Grip, scheduled to cost $199 and a part of the brand's Re line, is a fitness tracker aimed at runners but with a healthy sprinkling of smartwatch capabilities (including GPS), too. It would mark the company's first attempt at the saturated space, but looked strikingly similar to the Nike+ Fuelband (in size, style and design, with a low-resolution display), a piece of hardware that is no longer for sale. Wearables are becoming increasingly sleeker, slimmer and more fashionable \u2014 characteristics that didn't exactly sum up the aesthetic of the Grip.\n\nIn addition to improving on style, HTC should consider integrating the device with health platforms such as Google Fit or Apple Health \u2014 hubs that pull in data from various wearables and apps to allow users to see a bigger picture of their overall health and fitness logging.\n\nBut as of now, the company didn't provide any additional details about how the Grip will be worked into a new lineup of Under Armour products in the future, or what those products will look like.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

The spectacle seems absurd in any number of different ways. On the one hand, it's difficult to argue that America isn't more of a risk than it appeared to be a few months ago. I have a lot of sympathy with the arguments in this post, which suggests that the Tea Party has reached a political peak. To some extent, that seems to be beside the point; Washington's institutions are clearly more vulnerable to polarisation than many assumed. The debt-ceiling lever, having been abused once, is very likely to be abused again\u2014perhaps not by the Tea Party, but by someone. If you don't feel less confident in American governance now than you did a year ago, something is wrong with you.\n\nOn the other hand, virtually no one expected America to actually default on creditor payments. Markets never budged in this assessment, and they were right. Of course, as some analysts have pointed out, there's almost no difference in 10-year default expectations between AAA sovereigns and AA+ sovereigns, so it's not like S&P is saying that default is significantly more likely.\n\nIt's a little ridiculous that we care what S&P thinks in the first place. Not because they've been so wrong in the past, and not because they got their figures wrong, but because this is the most analysed sovereign in the world. The volume of material published about America's financial situation, its long-term outlook, and the likely political impact on both is simply astounding. What new information does S&P bring to the table? Nothing, as far as I can tell, and so the very fact that this downgrade is considered newsworthy is itself somewhat strange, and it reflects on the bizarre role of the ratings agencies in the global financial system.\n\nAnd then there are the markets. Treasury yields remain near historical lows. Investors are willing to accept negative real returns on American government debt out to 7 years. When it comes to perceived asset safety, few investments compare. And the worse things look, the better Treasuries look.\n\nIs there a significant and dismaying disconnect between the market appetite for Treasuries and the dysfunction in Washington? Absolutely. But no one needs S&P to point that out. It's obvious, and it tells us very nearly all we need to know about the current global economy. A world in which investors ran from American debt when America's government misbehaved would be a better one; the fact that markets are doing the opposite suggests that S&P's actions are the last thing we need to be worried about.",

Or even went without a TV interview.\n\n\"Someone somewhere must have thought putting it on me was a lot easier than losing their journalist relations for the ongoing junkets and multiple movies that are pending. I wish I would have napped to be honest.\n\n\"Who knows what to trust my friend, but I do know the cancellation was definitely not made by myself... I want to apologise regardless on behalf of those that misled the both of us.\"\n\nHardy explains that he spoke to Fox, the studio behind The Revenant, which he is promoting at the moment, but hoped that McWeeny understood that \"[his] legitimate frustration lies with those who organised the junket; who fed you and I misinformation; not me.\"\n\nThe actor was surprisingly laid-back about McWeeny's accusations, writing: \"Resisting the urge to dare you to say what you 'rant tweeted' so publicly, to my face next time we meet, which I doubt you have the balls to do; I want to apologise regardless on behalf of those that misled the both of us. That isn\u2019t cool. At all. Neither were your tweets. But that\u2019s by the by.\"\n\nAlthough McWeeny didn't address the post directly on Twitter \u2013 and Hardy is yet to publish the journalist's \"email offering to retract your misdirected anger\" \u2013 he did post this update on Tuesday evening:\n\nFor most actors, the film junket is something to endure rather than enjoy.\n\nFour-minute long interviews for eight hours a day, the same inane questions over and over again and a spoiler-free policy that enforces vague answers has brought out the worst in stars including Daniel Craig and Cara Delevingne.\n\nHowever, while many A-Listers grin and bear it, accepting that it is part of their job (like filing expenses is for normal people), others make the junket circuit even worse by behaving badly. Earlier this year, Tom Hardy admitted that he had \"a reputation for being difficult. And I am.

    "text": "After years of planning and an estimated $51 billion in spending, the Sochi Winter Olympics officially begin tonight with the opening ceremony in Fisht Olympic Stadium.\n\nThe lead-up to these Olympics, perhaps more than any other in recent history, has been fraught with discussion about almost anything but sports. Russian president Vladmir Putin\u2019s anti-gay propaganda law has become a minefield for many politicians, while the games themselves are considered to be a \u201clitmus test of attitudes to Russia as a whole.\u201d\n\nAs the world began to descend on Sochi this week, attention turned to the details that organizers of these games forgot: namely, unfinished and oddly-maintained lodging for media, stray dogs in the Olympic village, and last-minute security concerns for travelers.\n\nBut tonight, the opening ceremony will present a chance to return the attention to sports and the culture of Russia. Follow along as our team of reporters chronicle every detail of the spectacle.\n\nSpectators got remote-controlled lights that flash in unison to the beat in various colors, coded by sections. Even the empty seats seem to work.\n\nAnd here it is: \u201cNot Gonna Get Us\u201d by t.A.T.u., the Russian duo known for its lyrics and shows infused with lesbian innuendo. They don\u2019t perform in the opening, just this pre-show.\n\nWhen was the last time female pop stars in the U.S. wore floor-length skirts? This might be a first ever for a stadium performance.\n\nThis is an enclosed stadium but it feels like its around 40 degrees in here. Most people in coats, some in ski hats. Just in case anyone thought this was the Summer Olympics.\n\nThis is not to be confused with Vancouver, where Wayne Gretzky was famously sweating buckets carrying the torch when it was way too warm for the parka he was wearing.\n\nIn fact, the original plan called for the middle of the roof to be open, but a cover was added later.\n\nThis really is the modern Russia: No alcohol for sale in the stadium tonight.\n\nCue the fog machines! They\u2019re starting up in the corners of the stadium. Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s what that is.\n\nScattered chants of \u201cRossiya\u201d from the crowd as spectators try to keep things going after the end of the warm-up show.\n\nIt\u2019s cold, but you can cosy up to your neighbor. The Fisht Stadium is just about full.\n\nA handful of folks in the upper deck were chanting and holding up the flag of Kazakhstan. But now\u2026silence.\n\nSecurity personnel, who wear deep violet jackets, are walking amongst the stream of people still piling into the stadium. There are at least two very audible helicopters circling the skies.\n\nI\u2019m guessing that James Bond will not be arriving by copter as in London.\n\nHow about a performance by Sir McCartney? There is a video of him singing \u201cBack in the USSR\u201d in the Red Square and everyone dancing and Putin just watching stoically.\n\nThis is the world\u2019s longest Moment of Silence, only no one told us what it honors.\n\nThe Olympic opening ceremony is getting underway here in Sochi, taking visitors and athletes on a journey over thousands of years of history of a land that stretches across nine time zones and includes 150 ethnicities. It\u2019s an enormous celebration of Russia\u2019s rich culture.\n\nIts organizers, led by director Konstantin Ernst, are promising that over 2.5 hours, the audience \u201cwill see and hear the rich cultural, geographical and intellectual history of this nation in an unforgettable evening of color, light and sound,\u201d according to a media guide handed out before the show.\n\nOur guide is a child named Lyubov, whose name means \u201clove\u201d in Russian. She\u2019s here to take us through a show whose theme is \u201cDreams of Russia\u201d and includes 18 scenes.\n\nThe guide boasts that the opening ceremony show is \u201cthe most complex and ambitious technical show ever attempted in Olympic history.\u201d Well, the stakes keep getting higher here at the Olympics.\n\nWe\u2019re going to see dancing boyars, twisting onion domes, and human constellations, the guide promises.\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to see athletes from dozens of countries emerge into the stadium not from the side, but \u201cas if from underground,\u201d the guide promises.\n\nSome 10,000 Russians auditioned for the opening and closing ceremonies \u2013 and the most common audition piece was the South Korea pop hit \u201cGangnam Style\u201d by Psy. The youngest person who auditioned was 5; the oldest a mere 67. The most common names of women who auditioned were Masha and Olga, and Sasha and Pasha were the most popular male names.\n\n3,000 young artists are performing, including circus performers. There are people representing 17 nationalities working on the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nWe\u2019ll see lots of flying objects in this enormous Fisht Stadium, which has been finished just in time for the games. The largest will be a 66-meter long troika, pulling the sun.\n\nThe presentation starts with the 33 letters of the Cyrillic alphabet, with a film highlighting Russian contributions to the worlds of art, science and literature.\n\nAmong the Russian highlights \u2013 the periodic table, Tolstoi, television, Kandinsky, Chekhov, Chagal, ballet, Pushkin.\n\nAlphabet ends with Russian Ya, the last letter of Rossiya and a cheer goes up as the countdown begins.\n\nThe ground is shaking, we\u2019re counting down to the show\u2026\n\nFor the letter T, the little-girl hero said Tolstoy and television, the latter of which Russia claims as an invention because of the role played by Vladimir Zworykin. He moved to the U.S.\n\nOur star, Lyubov, played by and 11-year-old from Krasnodar, is on the stage and giant \u2018islands\u2019 representing parts of Russia float in overhead.\n\nThat is definitely not a live horse. Or a live volcano floating in.\n\nThe volcanoes are for Kamchatka in the Far East, the village is for the Russian heartland. There\u2019s also Lake Baikal (the biggest in the world). And even a mechanized wolf from Chukotka.\n\nThe stadium is covered in fog and a bunch of people wearing traditional Russian costumes just marched in. Lyubov is suspended from the ceiling.\n\nThe islands are followed by huge stars, passing in front of the moon. The five stars will converge and turn into the Olympic Rings as snow falls.\n\nA brave young girl has spent the last few minutes suspended by wire high above the stadium floor while white smoke fill so the space below.\n\nThe stadium is being transformed into a winter wonderland, with falling snow and thousands of people clad in white.\n\nLyubov also happens to be the name of the daughter of its architect and director, Channel One executive Konstantin Ernst.\n\nOn the stadium concourse I met a fan decked out in a Russian-flag Uncle Sam hat who insisted the $50 billion spent on these Olympics were worth it. After those floating bits of Russia we just saw, he must be even more impressed.\n\nWe just got our first Putin shot on the broadcast. First of many, one assumes.\n\nThose were some not-so-loud cheers when the announcer introduced Putin, no?\n\nLooks like there might have been a glitch there. The stars were supposed to turn into the Olympic Rings but one of them didn\u2019t turn into a star.\n\nThe crowd is standing for the Russian national anthem sung by the Moscow Sretensky Choir.\n\nThe Putin shot was unaccompanied by either music or cheers.\n\nThe monastery choir of Moscow\u2019s Sretensky Monastery is now singing the Russian national anthem. Russia changed its national anthem after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. But Vladimir Putin brought back the old Soviet national anthem \u2014 though the words were changed.\n\nHundreds of performers in costumes illuminated in the red, blue and white of the Russian flag walking out onto the field, looking very sci-fi.\n\nThere appears to be an invisible industrial fan blasting the flag to keep it flapping handsomely. That\u2019s an impressive detail.\n\nThey also used that trick in Beijing, Rachel. On a stultifying night in the Bird\u2019s Nest the flags looked like they were in the only spot in the city getting hit by 40 mph winds.\n\nThe \u201cathlete marshals\u201d in the colors of the Russian flag have LED elements in their costumes. Beam me up, Vlad!\n\nNow we\u2019re gonna hear a lot of Russian pop music as the athletes emerge \u2013 from under the floor.\n\nNow for the entrance of the athletes. The organizers \u201crenovated\u201d this staple of the opening ceremony hoping to make it livelier and faster. They will enter from below projected satellite images of their home countries. Now getting thundering music and photos of earth from space.\n\nGotta give them credit for moving the show along. The London opener wasn\u2019t even up to the Industrial Revolution by this point.\n\nA ramp has opened in the middle of the stage and the Greek team is coming out. Background music is techno from Russia\u2019s DJ Rudenko. Each country gets a photo of itself from space at night projected on the giant stage.\n\nHere come the heroes: now Austria. Huge team, all dressed in red.\n\nI hate when people take photos of me at night from space. It\u2019s such an unflattering angle.\n\nEvery two years organizers say they will speed up the athletes\u2019 entrance and every two years it takes about as long as the worst trip you ever made to the DMV. If they can actually bring them all out in 20 minutes or less, that\u2019s a minor miracle.\n\nInteresting to watch the VIP box with the world leaders as the teams walk around. I\u2019m pretty sure I saw Xi Jinping stand and deliver a conservative, one-handed wave to his countrymen.\n\nThe music they\u2019re playing for the athletes to march in sounds like it belongs on a catwalk at Fashion Week (which is happening in New York as we speak\u2026maybe they\u2019re streaming it?)\n\nThere are 97 teams, according to the guide, which says the procession will take 46 minutes!\n\nBermuda! Another Winter Olympics underdog.\n\nWait, Bermuda? And they\u2019re wearing shorts. Do they have long pants at all? And what are they competing in?\n\nAs the athletes march in, they\u2019re flanked by rows of dancers in white fur vests and white hats who are dancing basic jazz moves in time with the music. Oh, now they\u2019re doing a \u201craise the roof\u201d routine.\n\nAccording to photos being posted on Twitter by Russians, one of the five Olympic rings \u2014 which transformed from snowflakes into rings above the stadium floor \u2014 actually didn\u2019t open and stubbornly remained a snowflake.\n\nThat really happened. Perhaps explaining Mr. Putin\u2019s stoic first appearance.\n\nSeems like the Olympic ring snowflake opened but opened late.\n\nReader Charlie Feng wrote: It looks like 95% of the seats at the Olympic Stadium are empty. Anyone else see this?\n\nThey might be the seats reserved for athletes which are being filled as we speak.\n\nThe stadium is nearly full.\n\nThis is not a crowd that loves to get its cheer on. Maybe the music is just too loud, but this is clearly a non-alcoholic crowd.\n\nThe stylization of winter sports wear in recent years seems to have led to a decrease in embarrassing team uniforms. Still waiting for a real howler.\n\nWhile we watch the athletes emerge, I\u2019ll mention I met U.S. snowboarder Justin Reiter\u2019s mom and godmother out on the concourse before the ceremony. They\u2019d taken a 25-hour train ride to get here because their frequent flyer miles only got them to Moscow. Their hotel, they insisted, was fine; they found it on Tripadvisor.\n\nAnd the crowd goes WILD\u2026. for Venezuela! All three of them.\n\nHere\u2019s Team Germany with the famous rainbow-colored uniforms.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s flag bearer is jumping up and down. Must not be competing tomorrow.\n\nEach team is preceded by a Russian guide, dressed in a stylized folk headdress and wearing something like plastic rings around herself.\n\nThe small Georgian team gets a nice cheer from Russian (which invaded their country in 2008, right when the Beijing Games were going on).\n\nThere you go, Bruce! Holy Terribleness with those rainbow ensembles for the Germans.\n\nAnd I thought the Sochi gear was bad.\n\nAs the Germans go by I realize I spoke too soon on the uniforms.\n\nZimbabwe must be psyched not to be at the end of the alphabet! In cyrillic, Z comes near the start.\n\nWe\u2019re up to Iran, No. 28 in the order of nations. USA is No. 66.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit hard to judge anything from the level of cheering. It\u2019s a fairly docile crowd.\n\nThe marshals leaving nothing to chance, coming out to block the track around the field so the teams don\u2019t go the wrong way. (That was apparently an issue in the rehearsal.)\n\nIreland\u2019s team is dressed like the military.\n\nSpain gets a solid cheer. (But it starts with E in Russian, so still a way to go.)\n\nSounds like a lot of Kazakh fans in the house tonight!\n\nGreg, that\u2019s the first time that line has ever been used in WSJ live blog history.\n\nItalian contingent is huge. They must all have been ordered to show up, unlike lots of athletes from other countries who skip the ceremony.\n\nCayman Island looks to be the smallest team so far \u2013 3 athletes. And a loud cheer for Canada, which appears to have sent its entire population.\n\nHuge cheers as Canada comes out. Finally, a country that actually has snow.\n\nHuge cheers as Canada comes out. Finally, a country that actually has snow.\n\nTo answer the question from reader Eric: Russia is last. Number 88.\n\nSome of the biggest teams we\u2019ve seen so far, including Germany and Canada, don\u2019t have their world leaders on hand.\n\nMexico looks like it borrowed suits from Bob Dylan\u2019s band.\n\nRussian techno dancers showing signs of fatigue. They must be like, \u201cOh come on. Luxembourg!?\u201d\n\nAs far as I can tell, Peru isn\u2019t wearing matching outfits. Casual Friday?\n\nIt\u2019s getting cold. Rachel is putting on her gloves. I just donned the Sochi 2014 hat with a bear face on it that I was forced to buy after hearing it would be freezing here because it was all they had left at the press center merchandise store\u2026\n\nLove it \u2013 the tiny Republic of San Marino is here.\n\nSlovenia \u2013 we\u2019re almost there. It\u2019s time for a hot chocolate break (preferably with something in it\u2026).\n\nTeam USA gets a loud cheer from the Russian crowd.\n\nHere\u2019s the U.S. \u2013 those Ralph Lauren sweaters!\n\nBrian, I swear, every now and then, I see one of them go crazy. Like they just found a new gear and need to share it.\n\nThere seems to be some disagreement among the live-blogging and live-tweeting journalists here about the loudness of the Team USA cheer. I think it was sizable, but not the loudest we\u2019ve heard?\n\nUkraine, which lately has had very tense relations with Russia, gets a big cheer.\n\nDefinitely not as loud as the one for Canada.\n\nBut the Canadians had better costumes.\n\nAnd now the cheer for Ukraine is huge\u2026\n\nAs long as this procession is (and it is looonnng), there are lots of athletes sitting it out, as Brian Costa told us in his story today.\n\nFrance\u2019s gray seems to have been inspired by Ireland\u2019s olive with the vaguely military look.\n\nNow Chile.

(Snegurochka is the granddaughter of Father Frost, the Russian Santa Claus.)\n\nThe ramp in the floor has closed and the Russian team is making its way to its seats. Crowd still going wild.\n\nThe white fur-clad techno dancers are leaving. I will miss them, they must have worked up quite a sweat.\n\nFireworks \u2013 inside the stadium!\n\nNow it\u2019s the official mascots\u2026a giant bear, bunny and leopard-like cat\u2026on skates, skis and a snowboard.\n\nAwww, they\u2019re so cute. BIG Sochi bear, rabbit and leopard mascots are sliding around the stage.\n\nNext up a film called \u201cRussian Odyssey\u201d about the country\u2019s history, starring some of the country\u2019s most prominent actors.\n\nIn come the huge onion-dome floats for the next act, which is called \u201cRites of Spring.\u201d\n\nBig inflatable St. Basil\u2019s turrets have now appeared.\n\nAnd now an enormous neon white troika is floating across the ceiling. It\u2019s bringing in the sun.\n\nThe next segment uses a giant whale, as well as puppets, to depict Russia\u2019s feudal aristocracy (or so says the media kit). The puppets are boyars, Russian aristocrats. We\u2019re getting the Muppets Do Feudalism.\n\nThose inflated St. Basil\u2019s turrets are directly in front of us in the press section. Some of the turret-holders look like high school kids. Others are really well-behaved small schoolchildren.\n\nNow it\u2019s huge Russian dymkovsky style teapots and toys, crowding at one end of the stadium behind the troika. Very ominous Prokofiev music.\n\nThere are enormous dancing boyars, which were the highest feudal rank apart from the tsar in old Muscovy.\n\nAll the puppets and floats are coming together into a giant whale shape, and the music shifts.\n\nThe whale has broken up \u2013 symbolizing the awakening of the sleeping giant of Russia, ready for change and growth. The music is now dace version of Russian folk tunes.\n\nSwirling inflatable onion rings from St. Basil\u2019s. Ivan the Terrible supposedly had the architect\u2019s eyes taken out so he\u2019d never again build anything so beautiful.\n\nThere are acrobats bouncing on giant rings, doing flips. The bass thumps. This is getting serious.\n\nThe onion domes have floated up and the rest of the stadium is dark as the sounds of Russian church bells ring,\n\nThe inflatable onion domes have risen in the formation of St. Basil\u2019s, Russia\u2019s most recognizable landmark, commissioned in 1552.\n\nA scene from the opening ceremony.\n\nNext up is Peter the Great, which the media guide says focuses on the creation of a strong navy and the reorganization of the army \u2013 a \u201cmilitary regime,\u201d which may not be quite the first association for the founder of St. Petersburg.\n\nThe center of the stadium has turned into an ocean and thunderstorm to welcome Peter the Great, the tsar who built St. Petersburg and transformed Russia into a modern, European-facing empire.\n\nHere\u2019s the huge silhouette of Peter on horseback with a squad of dancing soldiers performing to martial music.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s Tolstoi\u2019s turn, with a ballet rendition of Natasha Rostova\u2019s ball from \u201cWar and Peace.\u201d\n\nFemale dancers in flowing pastel dresses run out to the soldiers and a waltz begins.\n\nNow come servants with candelabras and giant columns emerge from the floor to form the ballroom.\n\nThis segment features some of Russia\u2019s mosst famous ballet dancers, including Svetlana Zakharova as Natasha Rostova and Vladimir Vassiliev as Natasha\u2019s father.\n\nBehind us, as the ballet finishes, there\u2019s a black locomotive and a red fighter plane emerging.\n\nA man next to me in the stands just asked his companions to take a photo of him standing in front of the dancers while he flashed his guns (the anatomical kind, not the weaponry kind).\n\nThe front of a train has entered, suspended, from the side of the stadium.\n\nThe waltz morphs into Soviet composer Alfred Schnittke\u2019s brooding Concerto Grosso No. 5 as the dance turns dark.\n\nThis dark dance is supposed to symbolize Russia\u2019s descent into revolution in the early 20th century.\n\nNow some large red geometric shapes and wheels are moving onto the stage, symbolizing the 1917 revolution.\n\nI love the ballet and classical pieces, just as I thought the spoken-word poet in Vancouver was great. Neither would play at a huge US event like this, but each is so emblematic of its country. That\u2019s why we move the Olympics around.\n\nGiant red tractors and equipment rush in to symbolize industrial revolution and, soon, the Russian revolution. And it\u2019s the long-time theme from the nightly news in Russia.\n\nHuge cast of performers in red costumes. Visually stunning and enthralling with the constructivist forms overhead. Music building to a climax of tension.\n\nThis scene is so evocative. It encompasses the beauty of Russia\u2019s avant-garde artists with the arrival of the Soviet industrial age.\n\nI am so looking forward to Brazil, which will surely skip the national history concept that London and Sochi invoked and will instead go with drummers and dancers for 90 minutes.\n\nThe symbolic machine has stopped and the speakers are emitting and earthquake-like shake.\n\nWhite-clad construction workers are out with ladders and shovels, rebuilding. In comes a giant hammer and sickle.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the mascots:\n\nScreens with Moscow\u2019s signature skyscrapers rise from the floor to signify the Soviet period. A vintage Moskvich car drives in, followed by a Lada and Volga.\n\nHuge sculptures of the faces of the Worker and Peasant from the classic Moscow statue float through the stadium to thundering techno.\n\nA stylized parade of athletes on motorcycles modeled on the 1920s Red Square parades. Followed by a rousing chorus of the classic \u201cPodmoskovniye Vechera,\u201d a Soviet song.\n\nHere\u2019s the onion dome setpiece:\n\nThe official Russian-language @sochi2014_ru account just posted: We are walking through 1960s Moscow: the good, the sporty, the stylish.\n\nLots of talk about what Sochi lacks, readiness, etc. But this ceremony has been a fantastic tour through Russian history.\n\nSoviet children\u2019s classics, now, \u201cLet There Always Be a Sun,\u201d gets a huge cheer from the crowd, which must be pretty cold by now. Stage goes dark as Lyubov floats up with a red balloon.\n\nVideo of Russia\u2019s torch relay running now. The relay crossed the entire vast country, making it the longest in Olympic history.\n\nInterlude: Team Austria\u2019s press department just emailed to explain what happened to team member who was apparently photographed lying on the floor as the team marched in. The statement says director of Austrian ice hockey federation Alpo Suhonen slipped as he walked in at 9:11 pm Sochi time. \u201cHe was completely uninjured.\u201d\n\nAnd now it\u2019s Vladimir Putin\u2019s turn\u2026.he\u2019s being introduced by IOC President Thomas Bach and Dmitry Chernyshenko, chairman of the Sochi Games.\n\nHe gets one sentence. Bush violated this rule.\n\nNow speaking: Sochi 2014 President Dmitry Chernyshenko. He tells those gathered they are located at the center of a long-held dream for Russia.\n\nChernyshenko is giving a speech about how these Games are a realization of Russia\u2019s hopes, but he seems to be losing the crowd. We\u2019re pretty cold.\n\nChernyshenko says: \u201cThe games in Sochi \u2013 it\u2019s our chance to show the whole world everything that\u2019s best in Russia and that were proud of. \u2026 Our hospitality, our traditions, our Russia.\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone by Putin\u2019s English, French and Russian in 2007 speech to win the Games for Sochi, Chernyshenko is speaking all three.\n\nAs IOC\u2019s Bach continues his speech, dancers for the upcoming Swan Lake section take their places on the stage.\n\nThomas Bach, IOC president on Sochi: What took decades in other parts of the world has been achieved here in just seven years.\n\nSochi 2014 head Chernyshenko says one goal of the Games is to \u201cbreak down stereotypes\u201d about Russia. Given the heavily publicized hotel problems and other issues, it seems that\u2019s still a work in progress.\n\nThe Swan Lake dancers are standing motionless in sleeveless white dresses. They clearly aren\u2019t as freezing as we are. Sochi icicles.\n\nVladimir Putin in the presidential box stands and keeps his speech simple, declaring the games open and triggering blasts of fireworks. Now it\u2019s doves of peace, with ballet star Diana Vishneva to Swan Lake.\n\nThe Swan Lake dancers are wearing neon hat nets/capes that make them look like jellyfish in a dark ocean.\n\nThis really is the most remarkable Swan Lake I\u2019ve ever seen. Mesmerizing finish to the show, even after freezing through the speeches. Can\u2019t take your eyes off it. Could be the only part that\u2019s actually more stunning here than on TV.\n\nIt\u2019s a Winter Games. Where\u2019s my Nutcracker?\n\nThe Russians take the meaning of light show to a new level.\n\nTchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cCoronation March\u201d accompanies the incoming Olympic flag, carried by Chulpan Khamatova, a great Russian actress.\n\nAlso carrying the flag is Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space, who gets a huge round of applause.\n\nConductor Valery Gergiev is among the flag bearers, but no orchestra for him tonight.\n\nI guess Gary Kasparov\u2019s invitation got lost in the mail?\n\nStanding now for the Olympic Anthem, sung by opera star Anna Netrebko, who is wearing a light blue gown.\n\nNetrebko\u2019s gown looked just like that of Cinderella.\n\nThe last element before the torch-lighting is called \u201cOlympic Gods\u201d and takes its theme from the movie \u201cTron,\u201d complete with Daft Punk\u2019s \u201cThe Game Has Changed.\u201d Rollerstakers with LED-lit costumes swirl around the stadium under giant sculptures symbolizing winter sports and watching over the Games.\n\nBack to the light show/sci-fi part of the opening ceremony. These ethereal constellation-like creatures have floated in while roller skaters in white LED costumes are moving in, pulsing to music.\n\nThese guys certainly can put on a light show. This is quite amazing, with constellations in the shape of athletes above the roller skaters and the Daft Punk kicking in.\n\nThe soaring metal figures flash on and off now, suggesting motion, as the soundtrack wraps classics into the techno.\n\nChernyshenko said in an interview this fall that he wanted the ceremony to convey the message that Russia was a modern, open society. Did he get his wish?\n\nOne snowboard sculpture is refusing to light up.\n\nThe Olympic torch carriers, starting with tennis star Maria Sharapova, run up the ramp into the stadium.\n\nNext up is pole-vaulter Elena Isinbaeva, followed by Alexander Karelin, wrestling champion (and member of parliament).\n\nAlina Kabaeva, former gymnast whose role was widely rumored (she\u2019s also in parliament), hands off to skater Irina Rodnina.\n\nThe ceremony had a mix of tropes and people, from Swan Lake to Maria Sharapova, to play to the international audience. But also some imagery, notably the stuff about the Soviet period, to play to an older, nostalgic home crowd. I wonder how viewers around the world will respond to the depiction of the Soviet Union, which, as people have been pointing out on Twitter, did not seem to allude to things like the Gulag.\n\nTorch-bearers run out the huge doors at the end of the stadium toward the torch in the center of Olympic park \u2013 hockey god Vladislav Tretiak is holding the torch, Rodnina next to him as we watch on the monitors.\n\nThe history wasn\u2019t meant to be authentically complete, according to the organizers, just a way to show the country\u2019s best side. And if Ernst, the producer, is to be believed, the audience isn\u2019t so much at home as outside Russia. But the idea was certainly to portray a warm, nostalgic Soviet view.\n\nThe flame is lit. Crowd erupts. Fireworks everywhere outside. Sochi has begun.\n\nCrowd heading out as massive fireworks display erupts outside, over the Black Sea.\n\nHuge fireworks show inside the stadium and outside in Olympic Park. It\u2019s deafening but beautiful!\n\nThe opening ceremony comes to an end with a fireworks show to Igor Stravinsky\u2019s Firebird Suite and the Russian dance \u201cTrepak\u201d from Act 2 of Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cThe Nutcracker.\u201d\n\nOutside the stadium, some of the Russian fans appeared in awe of the performance. 28-year-old Tatyana Osipova, who came with two Russian flags sticking to her hair, told me she doesn\u2019t expect to be able to sleep. She also told me she\u2019s glad she didn\u2019t hear about the Ukraine plane hijacking scare while in the crowd, and that she felt confident about security here.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 By indicting members of the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s most famous cyberwarfare operation \u2014 called Unit 61398 but known among hackers as the \u201cComment Crew\u201d \u2014 the Obama administration has turned to the criminal justice system to reinforce its argument that there is a major difference between spying for national security purposes, something the United States does daily, and the commercial, for-profit espionage carried out by China\u2019s military.\n\nThe Chinese argue that the distinction is an American artifact, designed for commercial advantage. They believe that looking for business secrets is part of the fabric of national security, especially for a rising economic powerhouse. And while American officials are loathe to admit it, Washington\u2019s view has relatively few advocates around the world. The French, for example, were notorious for conducting state-backed corporate espionage long before the Chinese mastered the form. And if they choose, Chinese leaders has ample opportunity to retaliate by making life even harder for American companies.\n\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. repeated the we-don\u2019t-spy-for-corporate-America argument Monday morning as he unsealed an indictment that included allegations that Unit 61398 had stolen trade secrets for nuclear power plants that would save Chinese firms years of design work, as well as information from inside an American solar energy company that was pursuing a trade complaint against its Chinese competitors.\n\n\u201cThe alleged hacking appears to have been conducted for no reason other than to advantage state-owned companies and other interests in China, at the expense of businesses here in the United States,\u201d Mr. Holder said. \u201cThis is a tactic that the U.S. government categorically denounces. As President Obama has said on numerous occasions, we do not collect intelligence to provide a competitive advantage to U.S. companies, or U.S. commercial sectors.\u201d\n\nThere is little doubt, based on the evidence published last year, that the Comment Crew\u2019s targets include companies that compete directly with state-owned Chinese enterprises that fund the People\u2019s Liberation Army and often line the pockets of its leaders. But they are hardly the only targets of Chinese espionage: The office of the secretary of defense, the firms building the new Joint Strike Fighter, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Aspen Institute and The New York Times have all been targets of Chinese hacking units, for different reasons.\n\nBut the United States is limited in the complaints it can make because it has targeted similar institutions in China \u2014 for equally murky reasons. So when Mr. Obama raised the issue with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, he focused only on commercial espionage, arguing it is far more pernicious to use the intelligence instruments of the state for a business advantage. The United States may do all it can to learn about China\u2019s nuclear arsenal, or Beijing\u2019s intentions in its territorial disputes with Japan, but it does not, he says, steal from China Telecom to help AT&T.\n\nProsecutors focused on the most clear-cut commercial cases, perhaps because the United States believes the cases will bolster the president\u2019s central argument, that there is something sacred about intellectual property.\n\n\u201cThis is not something they pulled out of their back pocket,\u201d said Kevin Mandia, whose company, the Mandiant division of FireEye, compiled the first public report about Unit 61398 last year. \u201cThis was a logical escalation of the pressure.\u201d\n\nBut it was also an effort to regain the high ground the United States lost last year after the revelations made by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor. The documents he revealed suggested that the clear line Mr. Obama talks about when discussing Chinese cyber practices is often blurry.\n\nEven before Mr. Snowden walked out of the Hawaii facilities of the N.S.A. with a trove of documents, it was clear that the United States was not above economic espionage, as long as it was not for the direct benefit of specific companies.\n\nFor example, the United States spies regularly for economic advantage when the goal is to support trade talks; when the Clinton administration was locked in a high-stakes negotiation in the 1990s to reach an accord with Japan, it bugged the Japanese negotiator\u2019s limousine. At the time, the chief beneficiaries would have been the Big Three auto companies and a smattering of parts suppliers. It is also widely believed to be using intelligence in support of trade negotiations underway with European and Asian trading partners. But in the view of a succession of Democratic and Republican administrations, that is fair game.\n\nCompanies can also be targets. Documents released by Mr. Snowden showed that the American government pried deep into the servers of Huawei, one of China\u2019s most successful Internet and communications companies. The documents made clear that the N.S.A. was seeking to learn whether the company was a front for the People\u2019s Liberation Army and whether it was interested in spying on American firms. But there was a second purpose: to get inside Huawei\u2019s systems and use them to spy on countries that buy the company\u2019s equipment.\n\nHuawei officials said they failed to understand how that differed meaningfully from what the United States has accused the Chinese of doing.\n\nBut such reasoning is rejected by the intelligence community. \u201cI welcome this indictment because it has our government rejecting the false equivalence between us and the Chinese,\u201d said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of both the N.S.A. and the Central Intelligence Agency. \u201cIt\u2019s a risky course of action,\u201d he added, \u201cbut prior to this we were in stasis.\u201d\n\nIt is risky because the Chinese have already declared that they are shutting down, at least for now, the modest talks between the two countries on norms of behavior on the Internet.\n\nThose conversations were already fraught. Last month, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel went to Beijing to argue for a new channel of communication between the United States and China on cyberstrategy. American officials had already given the Chinese an overview of American cybersecurity, emphasizing that the N.S.A. did not take what it collects and hand it to Apple or Microsoft or Google.\n\nThe hope was that it would prompt the Chinese to give Washington a similar briefing about the People\u2019s Liberation Army units that are believed to be behind the attacks on American corporations and government networks. So far, the Chinese have not reciprocated.\n\nInstead, they have denied that the P.L.A. conducts cyberoperations. When The Times published a n article early last year about Unit 61398, in which it detailed some of the group\u2019s operations, there were furious denials from Beijing. For a few weeks, the unit went quiet.\n\nThen it came back \u2014 operating from different servers, but often against the same American industrial targets.",

    "text": "This is a rush transcript from \"Special Report,\" October 1, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nBRET BAIER, ANCHOR: There are a lot of things going on all at the same time. The Secret Service director resigns today after a series of failures, the first Ebola case in the U.S., the ISIS threat, the terrorism threat, things happening in Iraq, Afghanistan, and across the country. There is a feeling about that.\n\nToday, by the way, is former president Jimmy Carter's 90th birthday. And 35 years, two months, and a couple of weeks ago he gave this speech from the White House.\n\nJIMMY CARTER, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national world. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation.\n\nBAIER: Crisis of confidence speech evolved to be called the \"malaise speech.\" What is happening in the U.S. now? Is there a feeling about security and concern that possibly affects the elections? Let's bring in our panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Charles?\n\nCHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, I don't think it's a malaise sense in the country at all. I think it is a sense in the country that we have a presidency that is falling apart. And it isn't as if it all happened at once. The president comes in with a great division, expanding government, the government's going to solve a lot of problems, and withdrawal at home, if you say nice things in Cairo, you say we want an outstretched hand, we're going to eliminate all the blunders that the previous administration had made, things will get better abroad.\n\nNow it takes years until the consequences of that are seen. Abroad in the vacuum that we created by Obama's retreat, more aggressive, more wicked, in fact, some of the worst people on earth have filled in in Libya, Syria, Iraq. Putin's on the margin in Eastern Europe. Everybody senses America is not there. Our allies are very worried about the kind of support they're going to get. So that's a consequences of the policy.\n\nAnd domestically, the great idea of expansion of government, the new entitlements and all this, it is a crisis of competence. IRS, the V.A., the Secret Service, all the institutions that in the past you would make a movie about, the Secret Service agent is the hero, the epidemiologist is the hero, all of these agencies that we have trusted under this administration are showing how bad the government is run. You combine them and you get a sense that things are out of control.\n\nBAIER: Mara, today, with the Secret Service director resigning, that kind of capped what has been a pretty bad few weeks.\n\nMARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, it's been a bad three weeks, and the voters, as they have for quite some time, think the country is on the wrong track by two to one, that's true. However, the Secret Service problems predated President Obama and so far they haven't been turned into a political indictment of him, so far, although there was a Republican congressman who said at the hearing, as hard as it is for me to say that this president and family deserve to be protected. But I would say that there's true outrage that the presidency of the United States, the president and his family wasn't protected.\n\nAnd I actually think that the sense that the world is on fire, that things are falling apart, Ukraine, ISIS, Ebola, that was what was consuming the presidency for a number of weeks. I would say that things have actually gotten a little more stable. First of all, we have one case in the United States. We don't know if it's going to be an epidemic here and we don't think so. ISIS is now being attacked as opposed to a growing threat where the president stands up and says we don't have a strategy yet. His approval rates have actually ticked up a little bit recently, and it's because he took action against ISIS.\n\nBAIER: A couple of point in different polls. We have a couple of polls new out tonight, Fox poll number four, does the Obama administration have a clear strategy for defeating ISIS? Yes, 26 percent, no, 64 percent. Is the Obama administration on radical Muslim extremists, how do they stand? Not tough enough, 74 percent. And then the job performance on a host of issues, there you see approval, disapproval, and on the foreign policy front, obviously taking a hit with Syria there.\n\nSTEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes, he's in a very bad spot. Mara is right, if you look at the Gallup daily tracking poll from where he was two weeks ago compared to where he is now, he's up a little bit, right, right.\n\nBut certainly when you look at this broad set of issues that we're talking about, a lot of it reflects poorly on the president. Some of it doesn't. I don't think it's fair to say President Obama is responsible for the Ebola crisis. It adds to the sense that things are out of control, but it's not Barack Obama.\n\nBAIER: The overall sense that potentially security moms who have played in elections past may feel this angst --\n\nBAIER: -- on what the world is doing.\n\nHAYES: I think the political damage comes from what Charles identified. Remember, when Barack Obama came into office, on his first day he issued an executive order in which he said his goal, his objective, was to restore faith in government because without restored faith in government, he couldn't implement the kinds of changes that he wanted to make. And he was also very clear before he was elected and again running for re-election in 2012, that he wanted to be a transformative president, that he wanted to do big things, that he wanted to change the attitude of Americans towards their government, make them believe in an activist government again.\n\nNot only has he failed at that, we have seen a dramatic erosion in faith in government. And it's not just the things that Charles mentioned. It's IRS, it's Benghazi, it's V.A., it's the immigration debacle over the summer, many of these which have happened in the second term. And then of course you can't forget, ObamaCare, which I think is this rolling disaster, and we're still seeing and likely to see more dramatic effects from it.\n\nBAIER: Quickly, Charles, no one expects the president to give a Jimmy Carter crisis of confidence speech about all of the things collectively together, but there is a sense that what has been said at times by this White House, by this president, have not turned out to be accurate in a number of cases. I mean just today, the president has complete confidence in the Secret Service director, and then six hours later he accepts her resignation because it's a string of incidents.\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: Well, obviously nothing happened in the interim, so this is clearly a blunder and an obvious stupid one, the kind that you would make if you were president of the student council. You endorse her in the morning and you fire her in the afternoon.\n\nBut this stuff about Ebola is obviously outside the president's control. It's the fact that you get a beheading of an American in the United States, and then you get the FBI and others saying, calling it workplace violence when every sentient adult knows this is an act of terror.\n\nIt's the idea that the administration will deny things that it doesn't want to see the same way Obama denied and neglected the ISIS threat because it contradicted his narrative of the tide of war is receding. And it isn't an excuse to say that a lot of this stuff predated his presidency. You can say that in year one and year two. This is year six, the end of year six. At that point you are responsible, even if you inherited a problem or two, particularly if you are the party of government of fixing stuff, and obviously stuff has gotten worse.\n\nBAIER: Next up, an issue that the White House likes to tout that they say is going their way, the economy. We'll talk about that with our panel after a quick break.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

    "text": "David Sims covers the payment and data sectors for O\u2019Reilly Radar and is the author of \u201cePayments: Emerging Platforms, Embracing Mobile and Confronting Identity.\u201d\n\nGiven everything your smartphone does for you now, from mapping the skies to tracking your rides and delivering your website analytics, isn\u2019t it a bit surprising how difficult it is to buy stuff with it? Mobile commerce \u2014 like flying cars or domestic robots \u2014 is one of those promises that has long seemed just around the corner; a logical next step, but one that has receded into the future before us, like a financial mirage.\n\nAt the risk of getting fooled again, I think that\u2019s about to change. Twitter lights up every time Apple hires an engineer with expertise in near field communication (NFC), the wireless technology that will most likely power wave-and-pay mobile systems, and Eric Schmidt showed off tap-and-pay capability in an Android phone at the Web 2.0 Summit last fall. The fastest growing smartphone platform seems determined to roll out payment capability soon, and BlackBerry and WebOS are not far behind.\n\nSo what? How will that change your life if, instead of reaching into your wallet or purse to whip out a credit card, you instead wave or tap your mobile? Here are a few thoughts on how this shift will change the way you shop.\n\nBy mashing together geolocation, check-in services, mobile payments and social media, merchants and payment companies will no longer see you as an inert \u2014 if well-funded \u2014 lump of credit risk sitting at a desk, but as a story of errands, outings, activities, friends, restaurants and bars. The same device with which you check in at Chili\u2019s and upload your party pics now becomes something like your wallet, only more fun \u2014 and with a few skeletons in the closet. Credit card companies have long pieced together bits of your charge trail, just to get to know you better and figure out what odds they should place on getting their money back. They know, for example that if you charge frequently at a home improvement center, you\u2019re more likely to pay on time than if, for example, you suddenly start charging at bars and casinos.\n\nNow the story gets more interesting. Let\u2019s say your current weakness is Mexican food, and you\u2019ve become a lunchtime regular at a burrito shop near the office. Come Saturday, if you find yourself driving past a new taco joint on Main Street, you might get a mobile notification inviting you to lunch with a half-off coupon.\n\nIf any of this sounds creepy, it might just mean you\u2019re a few years older than the target demographic. In order to avoid alienating customers, all the companies involved in the system \u2014 from the telco, through the payment company, and on to the merchant \u2014 will want to make sure you\u2019ve opted in to the system. In exchange for that, we can assume you\u2019ll be getting, at the least, discounts on food and merchandise. But don\u2019t count on it: think how many people check in on Foursquare and Gowalla with no hope or expectation of getting anything more than a colorful, 100 pixel badge.\n\nSocial shopping is big; get ready to watch it get bigger as it gets mobile. Groupon\u2019s mobile chief Mihir Shah said in late January that 5 million Groupon iPhone and Android apps had been downloaded in the nine months they had been available. But receiving mobile coupons is only the start of something big. Now imagine if a critical mass of shoppers within a certain range of a store could trigger a bargain.\n\nThis comes on the heels of a few experiments already underway, like Foursquare-powered loyalty programs and rewards for first-time or frequent visitors. But there are new benefits, especially for merchants. Imagine if a coffee shop could offer a mobile coupon to someone who checked into its competitor just down the street. That\u2019s a new type of marketing warfare.\n\nThis transition will stretch the bounds of what we believe is acceptable for third parties to know about us. As with any economic transaction, it comes down to what you get in return. Where people once complained that it was creepy if an Internet service knew too much about you, we may be about to crash right through that barrier to the other side where users will begin to complain if the service doesn\u2019t know enough about them.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in Best Buy wondering if that\u2019s the best price you\u2019re going to find on an Xbox Kinect, and you scan the barcode with your smartphone, it pulls up a list of online sites offering the same product for a little less and a little more. At that moment, are you shopping in the real world or shopping online? Both, of course. Retail stores know they\u2019ve lost an advantage against online retailers when you no longer have to phone home to comparison shop against Amazon\u2019s best offer.\n\nThings become even more interesting when retailers begin to use the phone to bring you to their physical space. Some of the best examples are roving gourmet catering trucks that tweet not only their menu specials but their location to customers every day, so diners know where to find them and what to expect when they arrive. Geolocation ads are following close behind, inviting likely prospects to retail doorsteps just because they\u2019re in the neighborhood. I may not have a relationship with Trione Vineyards, but ever since I met their marketing person at a party a few months ago and became Foursquare friends, I get an offer to drop by their tasting room any time I check in at a restaurant near their location. Social, just barely, but there it is.\n\nOffers and invitations are only one way that merchants can leverage mobile traffic to make things happen. Analysis of Twitter and checkin stats increasingly provide valuable customer service data that businesses can use to plan and promote.\n\nAnd of course, the mobile device as a payment tool works both ways. Intuit, Square and other companies offer simple payment hardware and software that lets sellers big and small collect payment over the mobile phone. Square and Intuit\u2019s target audience includes very small vendors \u2014 farmers markets, house cleaners, the Etsy crowd \u2014 who may not want to fork out for full fledged credit card processing systems. And once merchants get used to collecting payments over the phone, who\u2019s to say that mobile won\u2019t free them from the register the same way it frees office drones from the cube? Remember the first time the Apple sales person checked you out with their iPhone, right where you stood? Beyond the cool factor of not having to line up to pay, there\u2019s no doubt that having more floor space for merchandise rather than registers is a plus.\n\nDisruptive technologies often serve as a wedge used by attackers to work their way into markets, and not incidentally to edge incumbents out of the action. One of the most striking examples in the mobile industry been the recent dethroning of Nokia as the world\u2019s most popular mobile platform. Nokia, which rose to the top of the market by creating sleek phones with great reception and long battery life, blinked for a moment and found that the game had suddenly changed. The playing field had shifted from practical functionality to phones with apps that can do fun things, like help you find cool places to go, shop, and share stuff with your friends. Now, Nokia must leap from a burning platform (in the words of its new CEO Stephen Elop) into icy waters if it wants to thrive again.\n\nWe\u2019ll also see disruption among the players who handle financial transactions. Apple, Google, and Paypal \u2014 hardly lightweights as is \u2014 will begin to take more and more of the transaction pie from current transaction leaders Visa, MasterCard, and the banks. They have a ways to go on this. PayPal\u2019s transaction volume is far behind that of Visa and MasterCard, and PayPal may never offer lines of credit. Still, the convenience of mobile payment systems baked directly into phone platforms will ultimately entice many users to put down the plastic in favor of using debit or credit systems processed through their mobile phones. The growth curve of phones running Google\u2019s Android operating system is inspiring, and no one is dismissing Apple\u2019s 160 million iTunes customers or Amazon\u2019s 130 million (give or take a few million). And let\u2019s not forget that telecoms like Verizon, AT&T, Vodafone, Telefonica and T-mobile will all want their cut of mobile commerce pie, too.\n\nThe incumbents aren\u2019t laying down, but the momentum could be with the attackers, and given the hurdle that any mobile payment will need to cross to convince users to shift from the wallet to the phone, it seems likely that the companies already most experienced at getting us to love our devices could be more successful in getting us to use them this way.\n\nSince the day you unfolded your first Nokia brick phone or raised the antenna on your Motorola, mobile phone use has been a courtship. Your phone is your diary of sentimental text messages, photo albums, e-mails, your music library, fitness tracker and Angry Birds scorecard. In a very short time, it is likely to be your wallet as well, enabling purchases not only online but in the physical world. It will provide a record (no doubt filtered, processed, and synched with Quicken or Mint) of these transactions.\n\nWith all this personal data and financial transaction history, it becomes pointless to argue that your mobile number isn\u2019t as much a proxy for your identity as, say your social security number or driver\u2019s license is. Those government issued cards may be more official, but your mobile-financial identity is certain to be more representative of who you really are \u2013 it\u2019s used more frequently and more closely tied with the things, places, and people you love. It\u2019s also tied more closely with your social graph and the map of your connections and haunts, thus bridging the gap between your mobile and other online identities.\n\nGiven how important the paying mobile phone will become, we\u2019ll want to ramp up the security on it. Passcodes to unlock, methods to find, and systems to \u201cblow up\u201d the data in mobile devices are already in place. Deeper levels of security are not far behind, including biometric recognition (thumbprint or retina) and methods that employ multiple levels of scrutiny \u2013 for example, your password, location, and some private bit of data. And if that\u2019s not enough, work is underway into voice recognition and \u201cgait analysis,\u201d the ability to acquaint your phone with the way you walk so that if someone else tries to walk away with it, the device locks up.\n\nHow are some of these mobile trends affecting your lifestyle? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.\n\n- Why Your Smartphone Will Replace Your Wallet - HOW TO: Make Sure Your Smartphone Payments Are Secure - Why Microsoft Is Nokia\u2019s Last Best Hope [OPINION] - 7 Hot Trends in Mobile App Design - Mobile Development: 5 Tips for Small Businesses\n\nImage courtesy of iStockphoto, bezov",

Micky Arison, the chairman and CEO of Miami-based Carnival Corp., which has owned Cunard since 1998, greeted the monarch and accompanied her to her seat. Arison sat to the queen's right; Captain Wells sat to her left.\n\nIn addition to the assembled orchestra and chorus, several UK military bands in full regalia performed at the ceremony, including the Coldstream Guards, the Scots Guards and the Fanfare Trumpeters of the Irish Guard.\n\nAlso performing was Lesley Garrett, a well-known British soprano, and celebrated Scottish bagpiper Louise Marshall Millington.\n\nPosted Oct 11 2010 2:05PM",

Filho and several others already are facing securities fraud charges over allegedly fleecing Spanish and Portugese speakers out of $12 million to $15 million.\n\nAccording to the civil charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and unsealed earlier this month, Filho and a group of men in Massachusetts and Florida claimed they controlled huge gold reserves in South America and Africa. They promised investors 10 percent monthly returns and commissions for recruiting friends and family, court filings say.\n\nBut federal authorities said bank records show Filho merely spent the money on himself and his associates, buying sports cars and splurging on lavish hotel accommodations. The SEC said in its complaint that the scam took in $15 million, while Justice Department put the figure at more than $12 million. The SEC said 1,400 people were defrauded.\n\nAn attorney for Filho didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, a Twitter account that appeared to represent the company denied the SEC\u2019s charges and said the company would make a statement, but the account appears to have been deleted.",

Sure, he had a calamity-plagued royal family of American politics \u2014 \u201cthe Winthrops\u201d \u2014 in \u201cThe Sky Is Falling.\u201d And there was an all-powerful Greek tycoon with his own island in \u201cThe Other Side of Midnight.\u201d But he surrounded these characters with legitimately fictitious ones. He invested their struggles with real and dishy emotion. Readers were drawn to Mr. Sheldon\u2019s stories for seamless soap opera, not for tawdry caricatures of recognizable celebrities.

He had great influence (and sales of 300 million books) as a guilty pleasure.

Only a couple of Sheldon stories (including \u201cBloodline,\u201d with a glossy cast including Audrey Hepburn, Romy Schneider and Omar Sharif) worked as feature films. The rest, including \u201cMaster of the Game,\u201d \u201cWindmills of the Gods,\u201d \u201cRage of Angels\u201d and \u201cThe Sands of Time,\u201d were perfectly suited to the TV mini-series format; they were too delectably plotted to be compressed into a two-hour running time. Even their minor subplots were too much fun to waste.\n\nEventually the world began to pass Mr. Sheldon by. As raw greed, sex, violence and voyeurism became pulp-fiction essentials, his once-daring books began to seem positively genteel. They lacked the necessary malice for today\u2019s market.\n\nThey were low on schadenfreude too. Unfashionably, Mr. Sheldon retained a quaint respect for hard work, decent ideals and real accomplishments \u2014 the very qualities worth admiring about his own career.\n\nStill, he had a public persona that stressed success. On his Web site, www.sidneysheldon.com, the reader eager for inside information (\u201cWant to know even more about Sidney Sheldon? What he has for dinner?\u201d) needed to answer only rudimentary questions about the Sheldon oeuvre (\u201cName the first novel written by Sidney Sheldon\u201d) to peer inside the keyhole. If you passed a grueling two-question quiz, you would learn exactly what was on the menu on April 23, 2002, when Mr. Sheldon and his chef had a dinner party for eight guests. Click again, and you could find a slew of special recipes, like a pedigreed beef Wellington from Paul Burrell, best known as butler to Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nWith Mr. Sheldon\u2019s death on Tuesday, there are two ways to look back on such self-promotion. The first, unavoidable view is that Mr. Sheldon became an inveterate show-off, seduced by the trappings of wealth and power. The second and kinder one: that he had the warmth of one of his own characters. The party was glamorous, and he wanted his fans to know about it. He did not want their noses pressed to the glass. He wanted them invited in.",

The 4:22 a.m. (1922 GMT Friday) quake shook buildings in Tokyo, about 250 kilometers (120 miles) northwest of the epicenter.\n\nA 20-centimeter (8-inch) tsunami reached the coast of Ishinomaki Ayukawa and Ofunato, about 50 minutes after the quake. Smaller waves were observed at several other locations along the coast.

    "text": "Happy and glorious, in spite of everything (Pic: PA)\n\nRecently, there have been two powerful challenges to the conventional wisdom about the United States. First, Robert Kagan published a lengthy essay in The New Republic, arguing that predictions of America's decline as a global power are woefully premature. Next, Andrew Sullivan set off something of an internet firestorm by claiming in Newsweek that Barack Obama \u2013 contrary to the criticism from both Right and Left \u2013 has actually been a pretty good President.\n\nIs it possible, I found myself wondering, to do something similar for Britain? Is there a case to be made that we are not in irreversible decline, but in a situation like the 1970s (when the Washington Post produced the headline above), simply waiting for the right leadership to save us? And \u2013 to combine Kagan with Sullivan \u2013 might that leadership even be our very own Coalition?\n\nObviously, the immediate portents are grim, or worse. Indeed, if Alex Salmond gets his way, it will indeed be goodbye for this country as it stands. But if you assume that the Union sticks together, and take the long-term view, it's possible to construct an argument that might provide a little encouragement. So, here goes:\n\nA wreck at the moment, but not without its underlying strengths. Private sector job creation is surprisingly robust. Businesses are in good shape, and many are world-beaters. Massive devaluation has created a stimulus to export and manufacture that is slowly working its way through the system. The City is \u2013 if the EU can be kept at bay \u2013 an asset of enormous importance, which could potentially capture a large slice of the market as the burgeoning (and ageing) middle classes of Asia start to need things like pensions, health insurance and investment portfolios. For all the current banker-bashing, we have a competitive advantage here akin to Germany's in car design \u2013 and in London, one of the leading global hubs in the new age of city-states.\n\nAn underappreciated asset. Britain is set to become Europe's largest nation over the coming decades \u2013 just look at the demand for more primary schools. That might well make the South-East one of the most cramped and unpleasant places in the world. Equally, it could smooth out the problem of an ageing population, as we attract disciplined, hard-working, entrepreneurial people to the country (or perhaps the city) in the world that is arguably the most comfortable with multi-culturalism. Even if we're not able to reap the same demographic dividend as our Asian competitors, we're certainly much better placed than the rest of Europe here. That's one of the reasons why Goldman Sachs predicted that by 2050, Britain's economy will be not just larger than Germany or France's, but wealthier, too.\n\nThere's no denying that Britain is slipping down the league tables. Equally, there's no denying that we have some fantastic schools and universities that are at last starting to export their know-how overseas. With luck and a following wind, Michael Gove's long overdue and vitally important education reforms will address the pipeline problem, producing better qualified and motivated pupils taught to higher standards, from a diverse variety of schools that push each other to improve. At the same time, IDS's welfare reforms will mean that benefit dependency ceases to be an option, reducing the cost to the state and reinvigorating areas of the country that have essentially been allowed to opt out of the enterprise economy. Finally, our universities are already adding significant value to the foreign students who use them, and our use of the global language gives us a natural edge \u2013 so why can't Britain consolidate its position as a finishing school for the world's elite, even creaming off the best of them to contribute to the economy here?\n\nYes, the SDSR has stripped back British capacity \u2013 but we're still punching well above our weight, especially given our tie-up with America and access to much of its most sensitive technology and intelligence. Britain is \u2013 as Peter Oborne argued in a powerful column recently \u2013 a remarkable force for good in the world, and sits at the heart of many of its most important institutions. One thing we've been very bad about, admittedly, is building trade relationships with other nations \u2013 in terms of selling our goods to the world, we're among the worst in Europe (one of the secrets of Germany's success, for example, is that it invests hugely in trade promotion). The Coalition is, however, attempting to redress this in building ties with India, Brazil etc, and our time zone, use of the global language and skill at valuable areas such as financial services, creative industries and high-end products should serve us well.\n\nIn the end, there is a prosperous future for Britain \u2013 but it's one that depends on us becoming leaner, meaner, more international and far less complacent, in a way that politicians have only just started to explain to the public. Yet it's notable that Kagan, when talking about America, can build his argument on existing strengths and innate potential; in Britain, you have to couch the argument in terms of 'If we do this\u2026' or 'The Coalition might\u2026' Indeed, it's just as likely that we'll surprise on the downside \u2013 that our debts and state spending and general tolerance of mushy mediocrity will condemn us to stagnation and irrelevance. Comforting thought, isn't it?",

First, Robert Kagan published a lengthy essay in The New Republic, arguing that predictions of America's decline as a global power are woefully premature.

Eisenhower resisted the early recklessness of Dulles and avoided a nuclear confrontation with Russia.\n\nAs Eisenhower campaigned in 1952, America was still formulating its response to a nuclear Russia. It was a key moment in the Cold War. A moment in time when it was incredibly important that the leader of the free world be the adult in the room.\n\nAs Richard Immerman recounts in his biography of Dulles:\n\n\u201cThe Joint Chiefs asserted that it was vital to roll back the communist bloc by means of coercion or even direct force.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the 1952 campaign Eisenhower insisted that Dulles qualify his references to liberation with the phrase \u2018by peaceful means.\u2019\u201d\n\nToday, we have an aggressive new potentate in Russia but fortunately not the hair trigger atmosphere of the early Cold War. Nevertheless, it is important that the free world be led by a leader capable of reining in the neoconservatives by not giving them free reign to their endless ambitions to remake the world in America\u2019s image.\n\nHillary Clinton, Marco Rubio and others still push the liberation foreign policy but without Eisenhower\u2019s cautionary phrase \u201cby peaceful means.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton/Rubio foreign policy advocated for direct force to enact regime change in Libya and Syria. Their only difference of opinion was in the degree of direct force necessary. Clinton and Obama tend to intervene but primarily by armaments and air power. Rubio, on the other hand, beats his chest and insists we must also have American boots on the ground in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Nigeria, and anywhere else terrorism arises.\n\nCurrently, 31 factions in 16 countries pledge allegiance to ISIS. Were we ever to have a substantive debate over foreign policy, one might want to ask Mr. Rubio which countries he will send troops to\u2014or maybe it\u2019s a shorter list of which countries won\u2019t he send troops to.\n\nThe Clinton/Rubio foreign policy calls for a no-fly zone over Syria in airspace in which Russia already flies \u2014 a recipe for confrontation. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised since the Clinton/Rubio foreign policy also called for admitting Georgia to NATO at a time when Russia already had her tentacles in Georgia \u2014 an invitation to war with Russia.\n\nWhen I forced the Foreign Relations Committee to debate an authorization of military force against ISIS, Senator Rubio and McCain insisted that the new authorization be unlimited temporally or geographically. Basically, they want a war without end against an undefined enemy in an unspecified region of the world. And the legal authorization of war? That never came. So we fight on and on without any Constitutional authority. No one seems to care or dare to insist that Congress declare war as our founders intended.\n\nSenator Rubio wrote the President at the time that he saw \u201cno legal reason preventing\u201d him from using his \u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d powers to attack ISIS. His letter makes no mention of the Constitutional requirement to seek Congressional authority.\n\nAs we enter into the season of determining the next Commander in Chief, I hope voters will seek out a leader who will learn from history and not pursue a reckless policy that seeks to liberate the world but in reality traps us under a mountain of debt and beguiles us into perpetual war.",

Here are some the recipes:\n\nThey looked pretty healthy to us but wanted to double check with an expert.\n\nMaria Bella, a registered dietician and founder of wellness clinic Top Balance Nutrition in New York City, says from the looks of the recipes on the site, they contain great natural foods but she cautions against following a highly regimented diet with little variety.\n\n\"When people lock themselves into these plans they often feel restricted and that can set them up for failure,\" says Bella. \"You want to make sure to see the bigger picture. You also want all kinds of colors and abundant natural foods and a variety of protein of sources.\"\n\nBella was concerned by the use of saturated fats-- in the form of mayonnaise and clarified butter-- as well as processed food items like \"vegan\" cheese which usually contain unnecessary additives and chemicals.\n\n\"If possible, stick with poly- or monounsaturated sources of fat in your diet,\" the nutritionist says.\n\nIn the intro to his 2005 book \u201cIn Balance for Life,\u201d Guerrero explains that restoring balanced pH levels is the best way to feel better and extend one\u2019s healthy years.\n\n\u201cRegardless of your current state of health, if you follow my easy-to-use system for restoring and maintaining the balance your body requires for optimal health, I guarantee that you will experience a noticeable difference in how you feel,\u201d Guerrero writes.\n\nWe're not sure if Brady uses these to take his health to the next level.

    "text": "Mark Teixeira was shaping up as an MVP candidate last year for the Yankees before a fracture suffered while fouling a ball off his right shin ended his season on Aug. 17, weakening the team\u2019s lineup in September and for its wild card loss to Houston.\n\nHealth has long been a concern for the first baseman during his Yankee tenure, but he showed once again on Thursday the kind of impact he can have as long as he can stay on the field.\n\nTeixeira broke a seventh-inning deadlock by lining a go-ahead, opposite-field, three-run homer just over the Canon sign in left field off a 98-mph Ken Giles fastball to lift the Yankees to an 8-5 win over the Astros.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say enough about Mark Teixeira,\u201d said Alex Rodriguez, who went 2-for-4 with a tying RBI single in the fifth and likened the impact of the switch-hitting Teixeira to that of Bernie Williams in the \u201990s. \u201cHe\u2019s just been unbelievable. It was remarkable how much we missed him when he went down last year.\u201d\n\nBack-to-back singles by Brett Gardner and Rodriguez set the table for Teixeira to break the 5-5 tie with his 193rd homer as a Yankee, passing Tino Martinez for sole possession of 17th place on the team\u2019s all-time home runs list. He had a check-swing single down the third-base line in the second inning to beat a sharp shift, and scored on a Chase Headley sacrifice fly.\n\nThe first baseman, who turns 36 on Monday and finished 2-for-4 with a homer for the second straight day, has had a history of various ailments, but has downplayed last season\u2019s injury, seeming uninterested in discussing it. He also reiterated his desire from spring training to remain with the Yankees (2-1) after his contract runs out at the end of this season.\n\n\u201cI think you guys are putting way too much on a freak injury that happened last year,\u201d said Teixeira, who had 31 homers in 111 games last season. \u201cThey happen to players all over the place. I feel great. I feel like I\u2019m gonna play another five or six seasons, and this is just the start of the season. It doesn\u2019t mean anything more or less. It\u2019s all about winning games.\u201d\n\nProspect Greg Bird seemed poised to take over first base next year, but with him scheduled to miss the entire 2016 season because of surgery to repair the labrum in his right shoulder, it doesn\u2019t seem far-fetched for the Yankees to bring Teixeira back if he were to have another big season.\n\n\u201cThe Yankees is the whole package,\u201d Teixeira said. \u201cOnce you play for the Yankees, you kind of reach the pinnacle of Major League Baseball. It\u2019s just tough to see myself in another uniform.\u201d\n\nNew second baseman Starlin Castro, acquired in an offseason trade with the Cubs, continued his torrid start in pinstripes, going 2-for-4 with a solo homer in the fourth to cut the deficit to 5-4 as Nathan Eovaldi struggled, allowing five runs on six hits (two second-inning homers) in five innings while striking out seven.

    "text": "When Matthew Wayne was eight years old, he and his family went to a San Diego art gallery showcasing work exclusively from homeless youth.\n\nOne painting in particular caught his eye \u2014 the artist's name also happened to be Matthew. And then it hit him: There was a boy out there, just like him, but who didn't have the same advantages, who didn't have a home.\n\nAlmost 15 years later, it inspired him to take action. With two fellow seniors at San Diego State University, Wayne cofounded Art Without a Roof, a social enterprise that works with disadvantaged artists to create sustainable apparel and items featuring their art. The company's tagline sums it up well: Threads for Change.\n\nThe goal is to improve the lives of disadvantaged individuals while supporting local artists and art therapy programs. At the moment, the main cause is homelessness.\n\n\"San Diego has this amazing structure in place for homeless youth, because there's so many,\" Wayne, who acts as CEO of the company, tells Mashable. \"There are about 20,000 homeless youth in San Diego right now.\"\n\nHere's how the process goes: Art Without a Roof teams up with an homeless artist, and a graphic designer tweaks his or her work to turn it into a print or a piece of apparel, manufactured locally. Anyone can purchase these items on the website, and their dollars help effect lasting change.\n\nTen percent of every sale \u2014 from shirts to tanks to prints \u2014 goes toward expressive art programs for the local community, through partner organizations Monarch School, which provides homeless youth with an education, and A Reason to Survive.\n\nAn additional 7% goes toward educational scholarships for the artist. The company also pays each artist between $150 and $350 upfront for his or her work.\n\nArt Without a Roof has worked with notable artist Inocente, who was homeless in San Diego for nine years and attended the Monarch School herself. She was the subject of the short film Inocente, which won the 2013 Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.\n\n\"We saw Inocente's video in a social enterprise class and thought, 'There are other disadvantaged youth who are amazing artists like her, and have amazing stories. We should make a platform to get their stories out to the world,'\" Wayne says.\n\nThe company ran a successful Kickstarter campaign toward the end of 2014, raising more than $25,000. Together with the seed money they received from winning the the University of San Diego's Social Innovation Challenge, and the guidance they received from San Diego State's business incubator at the Zahn Innovation Center, the company progressed in a relatively short period of time.\n\nArt Without a Roof currently runs with six staff \u2014 including a creative director, copywriter, graphic designer and others \u2014 and has seen more than 700 customers so far.\n\nAnd while some apparel companies miss the mark, either aiming for social impact while killing the environment or going green at the cost of worker rights, Art Without a Roof understands the importance of both. Its packaging is recycled and eco-friendly, and the shirts are made in the U.S.\n\n\"It can be very expensive to make it all locally and organic, but that's the way of the future. It doesn't really make sense otherwise. We're trying to be a whole company that does good and makes a positive impact,\" Wayne says.\n\nWayne says the company will soon work with veteran artists through local art education organization Combat Arts, and will also venture into other products, such as socks, iPhone cases and bags.\n\nThe company won't limit itself to at-risk or disadvantaged artists, either; Wayne says they'll eventually work with any artist around the world interested in making a difference. Starting in July, when the full-scale site launches, any artist can submit work to be considered.\n\nBut Wayne already sees Art Without a Roof having an impact on the community, inspiring passion and hope in these artists that they can achieve their dreams.\n\nHe says, \"They're using art as a gateway toward their next steps in life.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

    "text": "\"It's going to surprise a lot of people,\" said certified financial planner Michael Gibney of Highland Financial Advisors in Riverdale, N.J.\n\nMany high-income taxpayers will be impacted, as the net investment income tax will apply to individuals whose modified adjusted gross income is more than $200,000 (or more than $250,000 for married couples). The tax will impact some investments many taxpayers might not have considered, said Gibney.\n\n\"It will include capital gains, interest income, dividend income, passive business income and net rental income. If you have a house on the shore and you rent it in the summer and you get rental income, that will be part of this new net-interest income tax, too,\" he said.\n\nThis new net investment income tax comes on top of other tax changes, including:\u2014An increase in the top marginal tax rate to 39.6 percent (it was 35 percent in the 2012 tax year) on income above $400,000 for singles and $450,000 for married couples filing jointly.\u2014A new 20 percent tax rate on capital gains and qualified dividends (it was 15 percent in 2012) for taxpayers in that top tax bracket.\u2014And an additional Medicare payroll tax of 0.9 percent on earned income above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples.\n\n(Read more: Look who's paying the marriage penalty this year)\n\nAll of these increases mean that many people with high incomes may have underpaid their taxes in 2013\u2014and could face a whopping tax bill. Melissa Labant, director of tax advocacy at the American Institute of CPAs, recommends calculating your potential tax bill as soon as possible. \"The only thing worse than having a large tax bill come April 15 is being surprised about it,\" she said. Knowing about a large tax bill early will give you time to find the cash to pay for it.\n\nThere may be ways to reduce your taxable income, too. By opening and making contributions to certain tax-advantaged accounts before the April 15 tax-filing deadline, you may be able to cut your 2013 tax bill. Here are three tools that could help you:\n\nTraditional IRA: You may be eligible to put in up to $5,500 into a traditional IRA (or $6,500 if you're 50 or older). However, you'll need to check the IRS website for income limits and eligibility.\n\nSEP IRA: Small-business owners and those who are self-employed can contribute up to 25 percent of their compensation, to $51,000, in a SEP IRA.\n\nHealth savings accounts: Individuals can deposit up to $3,250 and families up to $6.450 into a health savings account. If you're 55 or older, you can put in an additional $1,000.\n\n(Read more: Some help Uncle Sam by paying extra\u2014voluntarily)",

    "text": "Drug companies pay medical professionals for a wide range of activities, from speaking engagements to consulting. While legal, the practice raises questions about potential conflicts, and whether the interests of patients may be compromised.\n\nFrom 2009 to early 2011, at least 25,000 Texas physicians and researchers received a combined $57 million \u2014 and probably far more \u2014 in cash payments, research money, free meals, travel and other perks, according to data culled from 12 drug companies and provided by the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica.\n\nDozens of these medical professionals were paid more than $100,000 each during that period. And 114 were professors, physicians, psychiatrists or researchers who were already paid a salary by the state \u2014 in some cases more than a half-million dollars a year. These state employees brought in nearly $3 million combined from pharmaceutical companies from 2009 to early 2011, according to a Texas Tribune analysis of the ProPublica data.\n\nNationwide, pharmaceutical manufacturers routinely pay medical professionals to assess a new product or to help contribute to the drug company\u2019s sales. The companies fly medical professionals to seminars and conferences and may also pay speaking fees. State-employed doctors and researchers are generally no exception, though they are supposed to comply with their individual institutions\u2019 conflict-of-interest policies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to state out of the gate the importance of these interactions, the value they bring to physicians, to health care professionals in general and ultimately to patients,\u201d said Karl Uhlendorf, vice president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.\n\nBut the financial relationships raise questions about the influence of drug companies on prescribing patterns or research results. The practice \u201cputs patients and tax dollars at risk,\u201d said Lee Spiller, the policy director for the Texas branch of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, a nonprofit mental health watchdog. \u201cIt taints the whole process. I\u2019d hate to think donations were shaping state mental health policy in particular.\u201d\n\nDr. Stanley Self, a part-time psychiatrist at Texas\u2019 state-run Rusk psychiatric hospital, earns $166,000 a year from the state. He also earned at least $145,000 from drug companies in 2009-10, largely for speaking engagements. Dr. Self did not return calls seeking comment on his work for drug companies, but his receptionist said he is \u201cnot doing much of that anymore.\u201d\n\nChristine Mann, a spokeswoman for the Department of State Health Services, said agency employees, like Dr. Self, are allowed to hold a second job as long as there is not a conflict of interest. The agency \u201cis looking into this issue further and will examine its policies to see if there are provisions that need to be strengthened,\u201d Ms. Mann said.\n\nDr. Joseph Bailes, an oncologist and the vice chairman of the executive committee at the Cancer Research and Prevention Institute of Texas, earned roughly $250,000 between 2009 and 2010 as a consultant for Pfizer. Dr. Bailes said that he has advised Pfizer on Medicare policy \u2014 not on drug development \u2014 and that it has no bearing on his role with the institute, a $3 billion endeavor financed by voter-approved bonds, for which he is an \u201cunpaid volunteer\u201d specializing in efforts to bring new cancer therapies to market.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t influence anything I do,\u201d Dr. Bailes said, adding that his committee is not responsible for selecting projects for financing.\n\nDr. Stanley Lemon, who left his post as the director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch in April and is now at the University of North Carolina, made nearly $80,000 consulting for Pfizer in 2009-10. Dr. Lemon, who is still an adjunct professor at U.T.M.B. but is no longer on the state payroll, said consulting for the pharmaceutical industry has enriched his academic life and made him a more productive scientist.\n\n\u201cAs long as they are properly reported and do not engender conflicts of interest or commitment, such interactions between industry and academia help to move drug development forward in a positive way,\u201d Dr. Lemon wrote in an e-mail.\n\nThe analysis of Texas pharmaceutical payments comes as the state attorney general\u2019s office prepares for a mammoth trial in January against Janssen Pharmaceuticals and its parent company, Johnson & Johnson. Janssen, which has vigorously denied any wrongdoing, has been accused of offering trips and kickbacks to state health officials to get the schizophrenia drug Risperdal on an approved drug list for medications that are paid for by the state.\n\nAcross the country, the reporting of such perceived conflicts has traditionally fallen short. Companies have not been required to disclose payments, and medical institutions have made limited efforts to police their employees.\n\nThe ProPublica data covers just a part of drug company payments \u2014 it represents about 40 percent of the 2010 pharmaceutical market in the United States \u2014 and includes manufacturers that have either begun disclosing their payments voluntarily, or as a result of legal settlements.\n\nBeginning in March, federal law will require drug and device companies to report and disclose all of their payments to medical professionals and researchers; by September, the data is supposed to be displayed in a searchable online government database. Texas universities \u2014 whose doctors and researchers account for $2.7 million of the pharmaceutical money statewide from 2009 to early 2011 \u2014 are working to update their own conflict policies and monitoring systems.\n\nThe University of Texas System will require its faculty members to report every dollar they are paid by a drug or device manufacturer and all financial interests in their research beginning Jan. 1.\n\nThe U.T. Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas is working on an electronic conflict-of-interest filing system that will feed into a soon-to-be-released public disclosure Web site, said Tim Doke, U.T.-Southwestern\u2019s vice president for communications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working feverishly here for the last couple of months,\u201d Mr. Doke said. \u201cTransparency is the absolute key to the public being confident that conflicts that exist are being managed appropriately.\u201d\n\nAt the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, university administrators monitor drug company databases to ensure that faculty-conflict filings match, and to set limits on how much doctors and researchers can accept, said Dr. Raymond DuBois, the center\u2019s provost and executive vice president.\n\nBut such efforts at transparency vary widely depending on the institution, or may be nonexistent when there is no institution at all. State records show that of the 74 doctors and psychiatrists statewide who have routinely prescribed the highest number of costly antipsychotic drugs to patients on Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for the disabled, children and the very poor, 10 received payments from drug companies in 2009-11 \u2014 from $11,000 to $180,000 each.\n\nAll but one got the payments from the maker of the drug they most commonly prescribed.",

According to Sebelius, the president did not know that Healthcare.gov, Obamacare\u2019s online hub, would have substantial problems on its Oct. 1 launch day. And, Ezra Klein reported Wednesday morning, neither did Sebelius.\n\nYesterday, I argued that the fundamental mistake the Obama administration made in its health-care Web site rollout was failing to appreciate that the Oct. 1 unveiling would attract massive interest from the moment the site launched. Project leaders should have expected very high Web site loads and tough scrutiny \u2014 and, most importantly, that the early rollout would be extremely important in setting public impressions of how the new system is working. If Healthcare.gov wasn\u2019t going to operate well, the public needed to hear it.\n\nWell, here\u2019s more evidence. Klein\u2019s telling has it that low-level workers withheld negative information from higher ups, making it harder for those higher ups to bring in more help, or to be clear with the public before and during the launch. But this wasn\u2019t just any other policy introduction, in which that excuse might wash. Healthcare.gov is the first visible manifestation of a law that has dominated American politics on and off for five years. And, since the policy relies on lots of people signing up, bad first impressions of the site can materially hurt the system the law aims to create if they discourage people from coming back.\n\nThe president should have pressed. He should have tried to navigate the site by himself, all the way through, before Oct. 1. Sebelius should have tried more than once. After they got nowhere, they should have been honest with the country about what to expect. Both apparently failed that basic competency test.\n\nFollow Stephen Stromberg on Twitter: @strombergsteve",

    "text": "Imagine if, after years of relishing your iPod, someone plopped a Walkman in your hand.\n\nThat's how I've felt testing the Polaroid 300, the new instant camera from Polaroid Corp. What ensued was a digital existential crisis.\n\nFor years, Polaroid made its name by offering football-sized cameras that went well with fanny packs and and spat out square snapshots that developed instantly (or, at least, what passed for instant back then).\n\nIronically, Polaroid became a victim of instant gratification, filing for bankruptcy in 2008 as analog instant photography had become irrelevant in the digital age. The cult of Polaroidians mourned \u2013 online, ironically enough -- and visual and written eulogies, some angry, poured in when the company announced it would no longer produce its iconic square film.\n\nPolaroid fans weren't left empty-handed for long: late last year, Fujifilm launched its own Polaroid-esque camera, the Fujifilm Instax Mini 7. Now, Polaroid has partnered with Fujifilm to rebrand that camera (with a few design tweaks) as a genuine Polaroid, with a new, business-card size version of the company's signature film, which can be used interchangeably with the Instax Mini. (A Dutch group called the Impossible Project has separately begun manufacturing film that will work with old Polaroid cameras).\n\nThe Polaroid 300 retails for $89.99 and comes in red, blue or black. It's currently available online and at Bloomingdale's and J & R stores, for pre-order on Polaroid.com and will roll out to national retailers in July.\n\nThis camera is smaller than its grandparents, but larger than today's svelte digital counterparts. It's conspicuously chunky and looks straight-up Fisher-Price. It's about as durable as a kid camera, too, surviving a week in my bag and two stumbles down concrete stairs with only minor scratching.\n\nThe camera is simple enough for a kid to use too: you yank out the lens to turn it on, and it only has four settings--indoor, cloudy, fine and clear. (Although I can't tell you what the difference between \"fine\" and \"clear\" is.) There's no zoom.\n\nThe wee photos spring from the top, tickling your brow seconds after you click the shutter and developing within a minute or so. Photos are small enough to tuck in a wallet and still have a tab for Sharpie labeling. Loading film is easy, shots are easily counted by number in the lower right-hand corner and the lens is simple enough to get the job done.\n\nPolaroid's vice president of marketing, David Miller, is the first to admit that for most people, the Polaroid 300 is a \"secondary camera.\"\n\nAnd for good reason: the film is a precious commodity. Each pack of film costs $9.99, so it's a $1 a photo. As someone with thousands of photos on my hard drive, the changing economics turned me into a more cautious, neurotic photographer. What if my photo turned out blurry? What if I loved a photo and wanted to email, TwitPic or Flickr it? What if I lost the business-card-sized Polaroid printout? My memory would be gone forever.\n\nThe designers of the Polaroid 300 were smart to avoid reinventing the Polaroid 300 as something it isn't: a high-resolution digital camera. The gadget is delightfully illogical: photos are expensive, it weighs down a tote bag and the photo resolution pales in comparison to even the first digital I bought in 2004. The Polaroid had fun and frustrating surprises like mysterious blotches, over exposure, and washed-out faces.\n\n\"People actually like the soft focus and graininess of colors,\" Mr. Miller told me, after I asked him about whether we'd ever see a higher resolution Polaroid. \"That's part of the nostalgia.\"\n\nWhen I took the camera with me to Baltimore to cover a kinetic sculpture race, the snapshots turned out darker than the bright digital shots and the weight in my bag was not welcome after 12 hours on my feet.

But I noticed that when I pointed the Polaroid at people, they seemed to smile wider than when they had a phone in their faces. Plus, they had a souvenir. One portrait subject reveled in the hip hues the Polaroid film cast on his face. Another yelped: \"Am I really that pale?\"\n\nIs the Polaroid 300 worth it? The camera took me back to simpler times; when we didn't feel the need to see our pores in party shots or dispatch our vacation slideshows to millions of strangers online. When photographs were treasures to be shared with people close to us.\n\nEven so this gadget is probably best left to the company's hard-core followers -- if there are some who aren't already loading up their vintage Polaroid cameras with film from the Impossible Project.

    "text": "Months after an unlucky bounce tripped up her hopes of a career-making win at Wimbledon, Ana Konjuh, ranked No. 92 in the world, seized a second chance, beating fourth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska by 6-4, 6-4 on Monday night in the fourth round of the United States Open.\n\nIn a second-round match against Radwanska at Wimbledon, Konjuh, an 18-year-old Croatian, sprained her ankle when she stepped on a ball as she ran toward a drop shot. Konjuh, who had held match points, lost every point after her injury.\n\nKonjuh said that near miss had motivated her to pounce this time.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an incredible player, and I\u2019m just happy to have the opportunity to play her again,\u201d Konjuh said. \u201cThis time I got the revenge, so I\u2019m really happy.\u201d\n\nRadwanska, 27, has reached the quarterfinals or better at each of the other three Grand Slam events but has struggled in New York, never reaching the final eight in her 11 appearances.\n\nKonjuh, a United States Open junior champion three years ago, has thrived in New York. She was in control in all aspects of the game, winning 86 percent of points on her first serve and hitting 38 winners to Radwanska\u2019s nine.\n\nWith howling winds outside, the match was played under a closed roof. Radwanska has played well indoors in her career, but she struggled to negate Konjuh\u2019s significant advantage in power.\n\n\u201dI was just trying to mix it up and not play in one spot,\u201d Radwanska said. \u201cWell, sometimes it\u2019s difficult when the ball is going really big from the other side. So it\u2019s hard to control, really put the ball where you want. That\u2019s what I was trying to do. But, well, she was really solid.\u201d\n\nIva Majoli, the last Croatian woman to win a major title, at the 1997 French Open, now serves as her country\u2019s Fed Cup captain, and was sitting in the front row for what she called a \u201chuge\u201d win.\n\n\u201cThe way she handled the match today, I think it was unbelievable,\u201d Majoli said of Konjuh. \u201cShe was very calm, and she looked like she was the one who had been on the tour for a long time. Very patient, waiting for her chance, and then being aggressive. It was a great, amazing win.\u201d\n\nAfter her precocious junior triumphs, Konjuh has risen relatively slowly through the professional ranks, stalled by a stress fracture in her back as well as wrist surgery.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy, but I could see already at the Olympics this year that she\u2019s so determined to do well,\u201d Majoli said. \u201cThere is no doubt that the talent is there. Mentally, she\u2019s very strong; that\u2019s why she became a No. 1 junior at such a young age. I think it was just about waiting for the right timing to do great stuff. It\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nKonjuh will face 10th-seeded Karolina Pliskova on Wednesday.",

    "text": "Reaction in Doha to the allegations has swung between blithe dismissal and a siege mentality as preparations continue. Photograph: Karim Jaafar/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSaid Brahimi should be in his footballing prime when the World Cup kicks off in Qatar in 2022. He plays on the right wing for the national under-19s side and will be 26 when the tournament starts \u2013 the same age as Adam Lallana, the England attacker who is about to get his first chance at World Cup glory in Brazil.\n\nBut , as he pulled on his boots to train with the national side on a full-sized air-conditioned pitch, the 18-year-old had to face up to calls for his country to be stripped of the event, amid the growing furore over claims of bribery during the bidding process by a top Qatari football official.\n\n\"[To prevent us] from getting the World Cup, which is the biggest event in the world, would be really upsetting,\" he said. \"I don't think that's fair because everyone worked so hard. They planned everything and now it has just gone because of some people trying to get the whole country down.\"\n\nWhat he may not comprehend, partly because the allegations have only been cursorily covered in much of the press in Qatar, is the extent and seriousness of the claims that Mohamed bin Hammam, the former Fifa executive committee member who previously led Qatar's football authority, spent $5m in cash and gifts to international football officials in the bidding process.\n\nBut the disbelieving response of Brahimi, the Qatari-born son of an Algerian engineer for whom Qatar's successful bid is a huge opportunity, reflected anger and suspicion in Doha this week where reaction has swung between blithe dismissal and a siege mentality.\n\nThe Qatari press has reported the allegations but has focused strongly on the organisers' denials of any wrongdoing rather than the details of the claims themselves. On Monday, the Qatar Tribune led with the robust rebuttal from the Qatar 2022 supreme committee, while it relegated the story to a three-inch column reporting on how the head of the Asian Football Confederation, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, believed the doubts about the bidding process raised by the allegations \"will be cleared up soon\".\n\n\"People here feel frustrated,\" said one Qatari sports official who asked not be named. \"Why are people attacking us like this? It is our right to host the 2022 World Cup. It was voted for by the European delegations too. Are they corrupt?\"\n\nAnother official said the claims in the Sunday Times were \"ridiculous\", \"entirely predictable\" and \"nothing new\". He added dismissively: \"There's no reaction, people here are cool. Work is in progress.\"\n\nBut Tariq, a Bangladeshi driver plying his trade on the coastal Corniche road, summed up another strain of reaction to the bribery allegation: \"I am 99% sure it's true. What they are building here is a bubble and it is not real. We are modern slaves here and only if you chose to ignore human rights should the World Cup go ahead.\"\n\nDid he believe the bid was corrupt? \"Yes,\" he said. \"On the outside they wear white, but on the inside they are black.\"\n\nHosting the World Cup is a huge deal for the Qataris, who form a minority of the country's 2.2 million population, which is made up mostly of 1.4 million migrant workers. It has become a pivotal part of the nation's 30-year development plan, so the possibility that the tournament is in jeopardy has sparked serious concern.\n\nIn the supreme committee's headquarters in a twisting 40-storey skyscraper overlooking the Arabian Gulf, inhouse lawyers have been poring over the allegations in order to \"take whatever steps are necessary to defend the integrity of Qatar's bid\". A London law firm has also been retained. The atmosphere is tense. The committee repeated in a statement this week: \"Mohamed bin Hammam played no official or unofficial role in Qatar's 2022 bid committee.\"\n\nThere was a sense of anger inside the headquarters that what the bid's leaders say was a World Cup won against the odds through hard work and meticulous networking was being tarnished. They also feel that it has been overlooked that Bin Hammam was also bidding to become president of Fifa at the time of some of his controversial activities.\n\nThe claims are just the latest wave of criticism undermining the embattled Qatar 2022 organising committee. 350 staff have continued to work on stadium designs and technical plans for the event as a wave of international scandals have swept over the proposed tournament , from labour rights abuses, previous claims about Bin Hammam's behaviour, and the admission, by Fifa's secretary general himself, Sepp Blatter, that it was \"a mistake\" to award Qatar the tournament on the basis of hosting it in the summer when temperatures top 46C.\n\nThe breadth of conspiracy theories in Qatar about the evidence contained in the email cache obtained by the Sunday Times suggests a degree of unwillingness to even consider the possibility the bid may be tainted. One sports official told the Guardian the story was to distract from the problems dogging preparations for the World Cup starting in Brazil next week. Some suspect an assault by the British media, apparently believing there is state control of the press in the UK as there is in Qatar. That theory is driven by the well-reported frustration in the UK at England's failed bid to host the 2018 event, which was awarded at the same time as the 2022 tournament.\n\nPerched on a velvet cushion sipping tea outside a shop in the Souk Waqif displaying a five-foot high replica World Cup decked out in Qatari colours, Mohammad Hamad said he would be dismayed if Qatar lost the right to host the tournament.\n\n\"I heard this on the news and it's not right at all,\" said the Syria-born shopkeeper. \"People in Qatar are very proud of this and live for football, and the Qataris want the world to come here and to see that this is a great place.\"\n\nThe extent of the damage will only emerge fully in July when a semi-independent report on the bidding process is due to be sent to Fifa. Before then, the Sunday Times is promising fresh revelations this weekend to coincide with the Fifa congress in Brazil.\n\nMeanwhile preparations for the 2022 World Cup continue in the supreme committee's brightly furnished offices. A bid clock reminds staff it is 96 months, 9 days, 22 hours, 57 minutes and 44 seconds away. The question remains: will Fifa pull the plug?",

Fortune\u2019s Brainstorm franchise, now in its 14th year, endures because of its unique blend of the power of Fortune 500 companies, the excitement of the emerging entrepreneurs of the tech world, and the connective tissue of the investors who finance them. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Brainstorm Tech takes place on the gorgeous campus of the Aspen Institute in Colorado. It\u2019s not the easiest place to get to, but Brainstorm Tech attendees tend to stick around, enjoy the tranquil surroundings, and have a helluva good time in Aspen while they\u2019re at it.\n\nWith these three constituencies in mind\u2014big-company CEOs, startups with juice, and financiers from every \u201casset class\u201d from venture capitalist to private equity\u2014here\u2019s a selection of participants in this year\u2019s Brainstorm Tech.\n\nJeffrey Immelt, in the news of late for slimming down his company, General Electric, to its industrial roots, will be in Aspen. Immelt sees GE\u2019s business as core technology, especially with the advent of the so-called Internet of things, a perfect opportunity to tie together the machines that GE makes.\n\nOther mega-cap executives on our stage will be Hubert Joly, CEO of Best Buy, a massive seller of consumer electronics, and Helena Foulkes, president of the CVS pharmacy chain, a key player in digital health. Another Fortune 500 member to join the conversation is Flextronics, the electronics manufacturer that increasingly is becoming a designer of its customer\u2019s product. CEO Mike McNamara will make his first Brainstorm Tech appearance.\n\nChange is a perennial topic in the pages, on the digital properties, and onstage for Fortune. We\u2019ve been around a long time\u201485 years, but who\u2019s counting? Okay, I am\u2014and so we\u2019re particularly attuned to big organizations and how they adapt. No one is better positioned to discuss change than the CEO of a Silicon Valley stalwart being spun away from other parts of its business. Dion Weisler, who will head the spun-out personal computer business of Hewlett-Packard (to be known as HP Inc.), joins us for the first time.\n\nAnother giant that knows about all about transformation is Apple. Most have focused on Apple\u2019s transformational products. Yet as the company has charted a course without its iconic founder, managing its people has become more important than ever. Denise Young Smith, Apple\u2019s top human-resources executive, will discuss this monumental task. Workday already is a big company, but the companies that buy its HR-oriented software are among the biggest, as its CEO, Aneel Bhusri, will be able to attest. Ed Catmull, president of Pixar and Disney\u2019s animation studios, can talk about everything from startups to big entertainment companies to Steve Jobs. In fact, we expect him to.\n\nSpeaking of startups, they are the life blood of Silicon Valley, and Brainstorm is where to see the Fortune 500 companies of tomorrow. One of the most likely companies to get there is Pinterest, whose CEO Ben Silbermann is heading to Aspen. Joining him in the lineup this year are Stewart Butterfield of red-hot communications tool Slack; John and Patrick Collison, the brotherly leaders of payments software maker Stripe; and Evan Williams, CEO of Medium.\n\nWe\u2019ll have plenty more startup founders and CEOs, including Katia Beauchamp of Birchbox, Clara Shih of Hearsay Social, Apoorva Mehta of Instacart, and Katrina Lake of StitchFix. Ben Kaufman, CEO of GE partner Quirky will be in Aspen. We\u2019ll even feature the CEO of a public company worth $3 billion, Brian Sharples of HomeAway, that gets far less attention than its theoretically more valuable competitor, Airbnb. (That startup\u2019s CEO spoke at Brainstorm Tech three years ago.)\n\nAs I mentioned, financiers are critical in technology\u2014and at Brainstorm Tech. We\u2019ll be joined this year by a special guest, private-equity pioneer Henry Kravis, whose KKR has been particularly active in technology of late. Repeat Brainstorm attendee Egon Durban of Silver Lake appeared four years ago to discuss his successful buyout of Skype. Since then his firm helped to take private Dell. Venture capitalist is just one hat that Reid Hoffman, a partner at Greylock, wears. He\u2019s also the founder and executive chairman of LinkedIn, a bestselling author, and a bonafide member of the PayPal mafia. With Hoffman it\u2019s a certainty there\u2019ll more topics than time to discuss them.\n\nIt\u2019s not all about megacaps, startups, and finance, of course. We\u2019ll also hear from music-industry stalwarts Scooter Braun of SB Projects (search: \u201cJustin Bieber and Ariana Grande and social media\u201d) and Scott Borchetta of Big Machine Label Group (search: \u201cTaylor Swift and Spotify\u201d). Lastly, the Aspen audience will hear two special voices from government, ex-Google executive Megan Smith, chief technology officer of the United States; and Rahm Emanuel, the recently re-elected mayor of Chicago, a global city whose tech scene is emergent.\n\nThe best news of all is that these people are just a selection of participants in Brainstorm Tech. Watch our conference web site for additional names between now and July 13th, when the conference begins. Brainstorm Tech itself is an invitation-only event, but we\u2019ll be streaming some sessions, writing about all of them, and encouraging our attendees to chat them up on social media. There will be a ton to say.",

Valves and vents maintain air pressure and temperature to protect Baumgartner from the extreme cold during the jump. It is also much more flexible than rigid spacesuits or the gear worn by reconnaissance pilots.\n\nDavid Clark Co. has long been at the forefront of advanced pressure suits for NASA and the US military. It made suits for former astronaut Ed White, who performed the first space walk, and even designed the outfit that protected skydiver Joe Kittinger who previously set the record for highest and fastest jump in 1960.\n\nIts involvement in the Baumgartner jump, which was funded by the energy drink maker Red Bull, was largely driven by its desire to gain more research and development knowledge, said Jacobs. Several of its employees were at the control center for the jump in Roswell, N.M.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing for us is understanding how the equipment and the suit will do for high-altitude bailouts,\u201d he said, which is becoming a greater concern among customers as both military and commercial crafts are able to fly at higher altitudes.\n\n\u201cThe more we prove out the technology, and have successes like this, it really give us more confidence going forward as we embark on new and different missions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Red Bull Stratos team behind Sunday\u2019s jump has agreed to share data gathered during the event with both NASA and the US military, whose pilots in high-altitude reconnaissance planes wear high-tech pressure suits similar to the one Baumgartner used on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe added a a little confidence to what the military has been doing for a number of years in these suits,\u201d said Mike Todd, a veteran skydiver and the Red Bull Stratos life support engineer who was in charge of Baumgartner\u2019s equipment.\n\nOne of the key differences between the Red Bull suit and one the military uses is mobility, said Todd. The military\u2019s suits are typically designed for pilots who spend time seated in cockpits. Baumgartner needed something in which he could freefall in a head-down position.\n\nBut even though Baumgartner\u2019s jump has demonstrated someone can survive a fall from more than 100,000 feet above the earth\u2019s surface with the right kind of gear, Todd said, these types of jumps are extremely dangerous and require the sort of training and expertise that someone like Baumgartner has.\n\nBefore Sunday, said Todd, Baumgartner trained for years and had performed more than 2,000 other jumps.",

    "text": "Like many other well-known organizations, we face cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. In mid-December, we detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google. However, it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a security incident--albeit a significant one--was something quite different.\n\nFirst, this attack was not just on Google. As part of our investigation we have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range of businesses--including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors--have been similarly targeted. We are currently in the process of notifying those companies, and we are also working with the relevant U.S. authorities.\n\nSecond, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Based on our investigation to date we believe their attack did not achieve that objective. Only two Gmail accounts appear to have been accessed, and that activity was limited to account information (such as the date the account was created) and subject line, rather than the content of emails themselves.\n\nThird, as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on Google, we have discovered that the accounts of dozens of US-, China- and Europe-based Gmail users who are advocates of human rights in China appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties. These accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users' computers.\n\nWe have already used information gained from this attack to make infrastructure and architectural improvements that enhance security for Google and for our users. In terms of individual users, we would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal information like passwords online. You can read more here about our cyber-security recommendations. People interested wanting to learn more about these kinds of attacks, can read this U.S. government report, Nart Villeneuve's blog and this presentation on the GhostNet spying incident.\n\nWe have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed, but also because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech. In the last two decades, China's economic reform programs and its citizens' entrepreneurial flair have lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty. Indeed, this great nation is at the heart of much economic progress and development in the world today.\n\nWe launched Google.cn in January 2006 in the belief that the benefits of increased access to information for people in China and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results. At the time we made clear that \"we will carefully monitor conditions in China, including new laws and other restrictions on our services.

His distant second place finish to Donald Trump in the Florida presidential primary Tuesday, however, leaves some doubt about how strong his standing is in his home state.\n\nAs his campaign staff members tweeted pictures of cleaning out their offices, Rubio said he had no thoughts about how to organize his 169 delegates gained in the early primaries and whether he would try to back one of the remaining candidates to put Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) or Ohio Gov. John Kasich over the top to knock off Trump at the Republican convention in Cleveland in July.\n\n\u201cMy campaign barely ended 48 hours ago.

    "text": "Is job growth slowing because the economy is near the natural limit of full employment, or because there's a coming downturn? That's the key question being asked today after a jobs report showed non-farm U.S. payrolls rose by 160,000 last month, far below the 200,000 economists projected.\n\nPerhaps in a case of macroeconomic time-travel, DoubleLine Capital LP Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Gundlach answered that question yesterday. The answer is everything is fine, for now. During an event held Thursday at the New York Historical Society, Gundlach discussed three of his favorite recession indicators. The first is when the annual change in America's index of leading economic indicators goes into negative territory:\n\nThe downward trend in this metric was at the heart of market turmoil at the start of 2016, Gundlach suggested. Its stabilization above 2 percent in recent months suggests \"the odds of a recession are low in the near term,\" he said.\n\nThe second metric has to do with the unemployment rate, which has oscillated between 4.9 and 5 percent since October. The unemployment rate has always crossed above its 12-month moving average when the U.S. is heading into recession, said Gundlach:\n\n\"The bad news is it's going to go above its 12-month moving average with a high likelihood in September,\" something that puts us \"on alert\" for a recession, Gundlach said. However, the bond king also acknowledged that this metric has delivered false positives in the past.\n\nThen there's Gundlach's granddaddy of recession signals. This one tells us there's no reason to fear a downturn in 2016.\n\nThis indicator is a slight adaptation of the previous one. When the quarterly unemployment rate breaches its three-year moving average, that's a sure sign that a recession has dawned:\n\n\"In fact it is so eerily predictive of the onset of a recession when [the quarterly unemployment rate] goes above its 3-year moving average that one almost thinks it is secretly the indicator the [Bureau of Labor Statistics] is using to define recession,\" said Gundlach. \"It is so amazingly accurate.\"\n\nThis indicator isn't going to rise above that three-year moving average for the next year, barring the onset of a substantial, negative economic shock, he said, and as such, this indicator \"doesn't say recession for the U.S.\"",

    "text": "Jul. 12 2011 - 12:10 pm | 7,385 views | 1 recommendation |\n\nImage by AFP/Getty Images via @daylife\n\nWith Italy in the eye of the storm of the EU debt crisis amid rumors that the European Central Bank has intervened by buying Italian sovereign bonds on the secondary market, analysts are coming to the conclusion that Italy is \u2018too big to bail\u2019 given its massive funding requirements and total debt outstanding of \u20ac1.6 trillion ($2.2 trillion).\n\nItalian equities managed to record some gains during Tuesday\u2019s session, up 1.3% after a terrible two-day beat-down that led to some of the largest spread moves in sovereign bonds in the European monetary union\u2019s history. Yields on benchmark 10-year Italian bonds fell marginally on Tuesday and stood at 5.66%, just below Spain\u2019s 5.96%.\n\nWith a plethora of negative news coming out of Europe on a daily basis, it is hard to attribute this Italian crisis to one event, but what is undeniable is that markets are coming to the realization that Italy is a whole different animal from Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, and that bailing it out might deliver a final blow to the beleaguered European Union. (Read Euro Contagion: Italian Equities Tank, Yields And CDS Jump).\n\nDifferences are staggering. While funding requirements for 2012 for the three PIIGs that have already been bailed out total \u20ac91 billion ($127 billion), Italy\u2019s funding requirements reach a massive \u20ac250 billion ($350 billion). Total outstanding debt for the country run by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is around \u20ac1.6 trillion ($2.2 trillion), compared with \u20ac345 million for Greece, and about \u20ac150 billion each for Portugal and Ireland, according to analysts at Nomura.\n\nIf Italy were to fail, the problem would be that it is too big to bail. Nomura points out that current European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) mechanisms were designed to deal with the failure of relatively small countries being bailed out by a relatively large group of participating Eurozone countries. The equation changes for Italy.\n\nCurrently, the EFSF has an effective lending capacity of \u20ac320 billion ($448 billion) out of a total of \u20ac440 billion ($616 billion); Italy\u2019s funding needs over the next two years exceed \u20ac500 billion ($770 billion). Not only would the EFSF (and its successor, the European Stability Mechanism-ESM-with total authorized capital estimated to be around \u20ac700 billion) lack the capacity to bail out Italy, the number of countries ready and willing to lend Rome a hand would be reduced to only two: France and Germany. (Read French Banks Hold $93B In Greek Debt As Sarkozy Announces Rollover Deal).\n\nIf Europe\u2019s two big dogs were forced to cough up \u20ac500 billion for their Italian buddies, that would constitute approximately 10% of their combined GDP (around \u20ac5 trillion, according to Nomura). According to the note:\n\nAt some point the load will be too big for France and Germany too. For example, would France be able to sustain an AAA rating with contingent liabilities to Italy in excess of 10% of GDP?\n\nThere is not enough capacity to bail out Italy within the current bail-out infrastructure. And even an expanded EFSF may not be able to provide a credible backstop over the medium-term\n\nOne possible alternative is central bank intervention to lower rates. Traders on Tuesday were pretty sure they saw the hand of the ECB, through the Bank of Italy, in sovereign bond markets for Italian debt in a day when they auctioned off \u20ac6.75 billion of Italian debt at a much higher rate than usual. And on Monday, a meeting of European Finance Ministers allowed for the possibility that the EFSF could be allowed to buy sovereigns in the secondary market. (Read Europe\u2019s Debt Grind, Worry Over Italy Keep Traders Jumpy).\n\nBut this might not be enough, as FT Alphaville notes. While the ECB has already tried these interventions with Greece, Portugal, and Ireland, it has not succeeded in ensuring \u201cdepth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional,\u201d as trade volumes in those suggest. And, given the size of the Italian bond market, with \u201cdaily turnover in May of \u20ac12 billion\u201d and gross issuance in the third quarter of \u20ac31 billion in two, five, and ten-year bonds, it would be a disaster for the ECB to make Italy \u201ca regular patient.\u201d\n\nThe situation is dire indeed. The political battle in Germany over bailing out smaller nations was massive, eroding much of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s political capital. Bailing out Italy, then, seems like an economic, political, and social impossibility.",
    "summary": "Italy's massive economy, and massive debt outstanding, make a traditional bail-out, like the ones seen in Greece, Portugal, and Ireland, impossible, as it exceeds the funding capacities of the EFSF and of Germany and France."

    "text": "A federal appeals court on Friday handed another victory to conservative opponents of campaign-finance restrictions, striking down limits on individual contributions to independent groups who want to use the money for or against candidates in federal elections.\n\nBut in its unanimous decision, the nine-judge U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia also said that a conservative group called SpeechNow.org must disclose its donors and other details of its finances to the Federal Election Commission, a requirement that the group had sought to overturn.\n\nSteve Simpson, a lawyer who argued the case on behalf of SpeechNow.org, called the decision voiding contribution limits \"a tremendous victory for free speech\" and said it \"ensures that all Americans can band together to make their voices heard during elections.\" At the same time, the group decried the decision on disclosure and signaled that it would appeal the issue to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe ruling also amounts to a mixed bag for beleaguered advocates of campaign-finance restrictions, who are relieved by the disclosure requirements but angered by the court's decision to strike down limits on contributions to independent political groups. The decision follows from the Supreme Court's landmark decision in January in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which found that corporations are akin to individuals when it comes to political speech and are free to spend as much as they like for or against candidates.\n\nIn a separate decision issued Friday by a three-judge panel, the Republican National Committee lost a bid to raise unlimited contributions from corporations and individuals, setting the stage for further litigation at the Supreme Court.\n\nTaken together, the rulings underscore the uncertainty that hangs over the patchwork system of federal spending restrictions put in place in the 1970s and strengthened by the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance law. The SpeechNow.org decision effectively expands the scope of a new, more free-wheeling campaign-finance system emerging in the wake of January's Citizens United decision, which swept aside decades of legislative restrictions on the role of corporations in political campaigns by allowing independent groups to raise unlimited funds as long as they do not contribute money directly to candidates.\n\nBut Friday's decision also endorsed requirements that such groups continue to disclose where they get their money and how they spend it. And the RNC ruling means that political parties and candidates are still subject to stricter standards, at least for now.\n\nPaul Ryan, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, which favors limits on political spending, called the removal of limits on contributions \"a significant loss for the American public.\" He also said there is a good chance that the Supreme Court, which ignored its own precedents in issuing the 5 to 4 Citizens United ruling, may be eager to address the limits kept in place by Friday's rulings.\n\nOpponents of restrictions on political spending viewed the decisions much differently. Chip Mellor, president and general counsel of the Institute for Justice, which helped bring the SpeechNow case to court, said the ruling in that case \"has moved us one step closer to ending this nation's failed 35-year experiment with campaign finance 'reform' and restoring the First Amendment to its proper place.\"",

    "text": "Buried within Tesla Motors\u2019 hour-and-fifteen-minute earnings call earlier this month was the nugget that the electric automaker TSLA plans to use two different variations of lithium-ion batteries for its two different grid battery products.\n\nThe news could easily be dismissed as just a bit of battery geekery, but there\u2019s more to it than that. It suggests that Tesla is not just increasing how many types of batteries it uses in its products, but that it has the ability to produce both models at its planned battery \u201cgigafactory.\u201d The batteries could influence how the facility is designed.\n\nBut before we understand how much this could affect Tesla\u2019s factory, let\u2019s take a step back to explain the nuts and bolts of battery making and why Tesla wants to do this.\n\nMost traditional lithium-ion batteries that are found in devices like cell phones are made using a cathode that\u2019s a mixture of lithium cobalt oxide. The structure of a battery is made up of two electrodes\u2014a cathode (positive) and an anode (negative)\u2014and a medium, called the electrolyte, through which the electric charge flows. Lithium ions move back and forth between the cathode and the anode when a lithium-ion battery charges and discharges.\n\nThe cathode part of the battery is the place where traditionally the lithium-ion battery industry can tweak the energy and power density\u2014or how much energy and power can be stored per volume. (Power is basically how quickly the energy can be taken out and put to work.) Different material combinations can make the battery able to store more energy or produce more power, and likewise make the battery more or less stable. (The energy created in a battery is, by its nature, volatile.)\n\nThe batteries that Tesla has been using, sourced from Panasonic, for its Model S electric car are mostly likely a lithium-ion battery with a cathode that is a combination of a lithium, nickel, cobalt, aluminum oxide. The battery industry calls this an \u201cNCA battery\u201d and they\u2019ve been around\u2014and made by Panasonic\u2014for many years.\n\nTypically, lithium-ion NCA batteries use a combination of 80% nickel, 15% cobalt and 5% aluminum. It\u2019s unclear what mix Tesla and Panasonic\u2019s battery combination is. (The anodes in these traditional lithium-ion batteries is usually a graphite combination, which acts as a host for the lithium ions.) The addition of the aluminum to the NCA battery makes it more stable.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said on the company\u2019s earnings call that Tesla will be using a high energy lithium-ion NCA battery for its new grid battery. Similar to the one it uses in its cars, the grid battery is intended for use by utility companies for back-up power. These are the batteries that, when used in a big battery \u201cfarm,\u201d could replace so-called peaker power plants, the \u201cdirty\u201d and expensive power plants that utilities use only when grid demand peaks, such as during a sweltering summer afternoon. (The Tesla website describes this as the back-up battery with a capacity of 10 kilowatt-hours and a price of $3,500.)\n\nIn contrast, Musk said that Tesla will use a lithium-ion battery with a nickel, manganese, cobalt oxide cathode for its grid battery. Called an NMC battery, it\u2019s meant to be used for daily cycling for a home, business, or certain types of clean power. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of manganese in there,\u201d Musk said. (The Tesla website specs for this battery are 7 kWh battery for $3,000.)\n\nMany traditional NMC batteries use one-third equal parts nickel, manganese, and cobalt. Again, it\u2019s unclear what the combination of Panasonic and Tesla\u2019s version is.\n\nThe choice of these two batteries makes sense for what Tesla wants its customers to do with the batteries. The back-up battery is intended to offer a lot of energy, quickly, to smooth out that \u201cheat wave\u201d grid peak without using a peaker plant. It\u2019s like when someone driving a Tesla Model S punches the accelerator.\n\nOn an electrical grid, these type of events rarely happen\u2014but they do. A back-up battery doesn\u2019t need to be charged and discharged on a regular daily basis, just when it\u2019s really needed. Tesla says its battery has 60 or 70 cycles\u2014charge and discharge\u2014per year.\n\nMusk optimistically says that the lifetime of that battery is 1,000 to 1,500 cycles, or \u201cmaybe 15 years calendar life.\u201d Those numbers should be taken with a grain of salt\u2014they are likely based on a situation in which the battery isn\u2019t always using its full capacity.\n\nTesla\u2019s daily charging grid battery, on the other hand, is meant to offer more reliable sustained charging every day. If you paired this battery with a utility\u2019s solar energy farm, the batteries would be expected to store the energy from the solar panels during the day to potentially be used at night.\n\nThe daily battery can have a lower energy density, but it needs a longer cycle life\u2014that is, it needs to be able to be charged and discharged many more times than the backup battery. The daily battery has a 5,000 cycle life, Musk said on the call, and a similar lifespan as the back-up battery\u2014but again, take those numbers with a grain of salt.\n\nAn NCA battery typically has a shorter cycle life and a higher energy density (and less stability). An NMC battery generally has a longer cycle life, more stability, and less energy density.\n\nPrinceton University assistant professor Dan Steingart says the materials for most NMC batteries are generally slightly cheaper than for NCA batteries\u2014there is more nickel and less cobalt used in the NMC battery. (Cobalt is more expensive than nickel.) But an NMC battery also typically has a lower cost of energy because of the ability of an NMC battery to cycle with more stability than an NCA battery.\n\nRemember: The more a battery is charged and discharged, the shorter the battery\u2019s lifespan. But battery life can be extended if the batteries are not charged and discharged to 100 percent of their capacity. If the battery is charged at only half of its level, it can last much longer.\n\nSteingart points out that to get the kind of life cycle that Tesla\u2019s NMC battery plans for, it could be charging and discharging at under 80% of its capacity, and perhaps even down to somewhere between 50% to 70% depth of discharge. To get the type of lifespan for the NCA battery that Tesla wants, the company could be doing 80% to 85% depth of discharge. For NMC and NCA batteries in general, Steingart notes: \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky dance of what the material is and how far you discharge and how you spec it out to be.\u201d\n\nAnother reason why Tesla can use two different batteries for its two grid products is because its main battery supplier, Panasonic, makes these types of batteries at low costs. (As do others, such as Samsung SDI.) Since Tesla plans to build the first grid battery products before the Gigafactory is up and running\u2014assembling them in Fremont similar to the way it makes its cars now\u2014it can just buy these in the traditional way, from a vendor.\n\nBut if Tesla decides to keep this model of two different battery types and implements them into the construction of the Gigafactory, it could fundamentally alter the way Tesla builds its factory. On Tesla\u2019s earnings call Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel said both batteries could be built in the Gigafactory and confirmed that Tesla will have multiple lines operating in the facility.\n\n\u201cIf one is nickel cobalt aluminum, and the other is nickel manganese, cobalt, that\u2019s fine. The processes after that is identical,\u201d said Straubel. Musk added that the packs would \u201clook the same at the module and pack level\u201d\u2014just differ at the battery cell level.\n\nAdding complexity to manufacturing processes typically adds costs. If there are two types of battery cells, then the total production of each cell type is naturally half of what it would be if the factory was just producing one cell type. That could be important because the Gigafactory is looking to lower battery costs through economies of scale that come with very large volumes.\n\nBut Tesla is well known for innovating around fundamental manufacturing, too, so it\u2019s hard to tell just how much complexity would be added with two cathode chemical mixtures. Though battery manufacturing isn\u2019t just about swapping one chemical mixture for another, sometimes different batteries need to have materials loaded in differently to optimize the power of the battery.\n\nTesla has also long said that it intends to be flexible if other battery chemistries and types\u2014including advanced next-generation batteries\u2014emerge on the market that are better than the standard lithium-ion batteries. Having two lines, with different chemical mixtures in there at the start, could ultimately be a way for Tesla to remain flexible to accommodate potentially inevitable future tech advancements.\n\nThat Tesla is looking to make NMC cells (the type used for the daily battery) in the Gigafactory, and not just NCA cells, could also signal that Tesla might want to make batteries for other applications or as a supplier to other car makers. NMC batteries are the types more commonly used in plug-in hybrid cars.\n\nEven though Tesla is a public company, it still tends to act as a nimble fast moving startup. It could change course or decide to not build one type of battery if it so chooses. Whatever it chooses, the decision could have ramifications far beyond the Gigafactory\u2019s walls.",

Your ears will thank you.\n\nPlus, you can also browse the site for other cool Tumbltapes, listen to random choices, or embed your favorites anywhere you want.\n\nThe Tumblr bookmarklet is great, but if you want even more features for browser-based tumbling, this Firefox add-on is top notch.\n\nYou can use the extension to drag and drop content \u2014 photos, videos, mp3s, quotes, and links \u2014 onto the Tumblr icon in the FirefoxFirefox reviews status bar. Content is then automatically posted to your tumblelog, though you can adjust the settings for each content type so that the extension\u2019s dialogue box prompts you to add additional info prior to posting.\n\nThe add-on is also sophisticated enough to handle YouTubeYouTube reviews and media parsing, so any time you drop a link to a YouTube video or raw embed code onto the icon, the extension will post a video entry with the appropriate content.\n\nSure Tumblr appears to lack some of the typical features we\u2019ve come to expect from blogging platforms, but because you can tweak your Tumblr\u2019s HTML you can add in a lot of those extra features yourself, including your very own tag cloud.\n\nThis third-party tag cloud creator is just a snippet of code that you can copy, customize, and paste into your site description (if you\u2019re using a custom theme, you\u2019ll most likely have to paste the code somewhere in the custom HTML). Now you have a cute little cloud to help your visitors view past posts, and have even more of an incentive to add tags to your tumblings.\n\nYou can already record audio posts that automatically post to Tumblr, but GoogleGoogle reviews doesn\u2019t index audio, so if you want transcribed audio posts on your tumblelog, you can turn to Dial2Do.\n\nDial2Do is a lot like Jott, except it\u2019s free while in beta, so you can use audio commands to record a reminder for yourself, send \u201ctexts\u201d to contacts, and best of all get your audio posts transcribed to text and automatically posted to your tumblelog. Basically you just configure your Tumblr account, dial 1(213)325-5615, say the Tumblr command, and start talking. Dial2Do will do the rest.\n\nDial2Do is also worth checking out for a myriad of other applications and services like GmailGmail reviews (you can record emails and listen to your inbox), Twitter, EvernoteEvernote reviews, FriendFeedFriendFeed reviews, and even MashableMashable reviews (you can listen to our posts). It\u2019s all around a very impressive service.\n\nComeks is a super fun and pocket-friendly free iPhone, AndroidAndroid reviews, and Nokia app that will turn your photos into comic-style original content, so they pop with creativity and wit. You can use your existing photo gallery or start from scratch, but the end result is a better-than-reality image that you can quickly add to your tumblelog.\n\nThe app comes complete with stickers of all varieties, so whether you want to add callouts, funky hairstyles, sound effects, or symbols, you can find a plethora of image-altering goodies to choose from. You can even add chat bubbles, use multiple photos, rearrange and re-size items, and erase what you don\u2019t want.\n\nThe best part is that even though the app integrates nicely with Tumblr, you can share your creations with FacebookFacebook reviews, Bebo, TwitterTwitter reviews, and FlickrFlickr reviews as well.\n\n- 18 of the Best Music Tumblelogs - Tumblr: What\u2019s the Best Tumblelog - 20 Great Widgets to Enhance Your Tumblr Blog - 20 Beautiful Tumblr Themes - Turn Your Tumblr into a T-Shirt Store",

Almost an entire quarter.\n\nThe Americans held the Finns without a basket in the second quarter, opening defense of their title with a 114-55 romp Saturday in the Basketball World Cup.\n\nSilencing the Finns in the second quarter on the scoreboard and in the stands, where their rabid fans filled an entire side of the arena, the Americans allowed just a pair of free throws in the period, outscoring their overmatched opponents 29-2 to open a 60-18 advantage.\n\nThe U.S. players also knew they were basically pitching a shutout for 10 minutes.\n\n\"Our coaches were encouraging us to keep up that effort by telling us every timeout, every dead ball, they only had two points or whatever,\" guard Stephen Curry said. \"That's just motivation to keep doing what we're doing.\"\n\n*By clicking \"SUBSCRIBE\", you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nKlay Thompson scored 18 points and Anthony Davis had 17 for the U.S., which will play Turkey on Sunday in a rematch of the 2010 world basketball championship gold-medal game.\n\nThe event has since been renamed, but nothing else looks different for the Americans, who won their 55th straight game.\n\nFinland was 0 for 17 in the second quarter, missing all six 3-point attempts, and missed 19 straight shots over the second and third quarters before Tuukka Kotta ended the drought with a basket with 8:48 remaining in the third that made it 62-20.\n\n\"Our entire team, the challenge is to see how good we can become in all areas,\" U.S. assistant Tom Thibodeau said. \"They spread you out and they can attack and they can shoot. Our ball pressure was very good and challenging shots was great, so it was a terrific quarter.\"\n\nThe Finns were making their World Cup debut as a wild card and didn't do much to prove they deserved it after the opening minutes. They missed all 13 3-point attempts in the first half but finally saw some shots fall after halftime when the game was long decided, giving their expected 8,000 fans who traveled here the chance to cheer.\n\nThe Americans played just four exhibition games and their players average just over 24 years of age, the youngest team they've ever sent using professionals.\n\nNo problem against the Finns, where their size and athletic advantages made it look like men against boys.\n\nAnd even if they draw host Spain in Madrid on Sept. 14 in the championship game, they wouldn't face a crowd that was much louder than this.\n\nFans wearing Finnish blue and white were pouring out of the exits of the metro station outside the arena by the dozens more than two hours before the start, looking like college football alums arriving for a Saturday morning tailgate.\n\nThey filled nearly every seat behind one of the baskets, cheering loudly from warmups straight through the opening minutes, when Gerald Lee made the game's first basket.\n\n\"It was awesome,\" Curry said. \"They were energetic regardless of the score. Seemed like every basket Finland made was like a game-winner.\"\n\nThere just weren't many of them.\n\nLee had Finland's next bucket to tie it at 4 but then picked up a third foul just over 2 minutes into the game and had to go to the bench, leaving the Finns with nobody who could compete in the paint.\n\nIt was 31-16 after one, but after Teemu Rannikko's free throws cut it to 39-18 with about 6 minutes remaining, the U.S. scored the final 21 points of the half, forcing a missed shot on defense, then running out for a layup.\n\nEvery U.S. player scored. Derrick Rose finished with 12 points and Rudy Gay had 10 as the Americans shot 59 percent from the field.\n\nFinland finished just ninth in last year's European championship, failing to qualify automatically for the World Cup. But the Finns, ranked 39th, became the lowest-ranked team ever to receive a wild card, with basketball governing FIBA noting Finland's improvement on the court and the strength of its fan base.\n\nAnd it didn't hurt that Finnish company Rovio, maker of the Angry Birds games, offered to provide advertising for FIBA if Finland was selected.\n\nBut none of those could help on the court, where all the best players were wearing red, white and blue and delivered highlight plays, with Rose flashing his old explosiveness with a second quarter drive and dunk.\n\nShawn Huff and Petteri Koponen each scored 12 points for Finland, which shot 28 percent.",

    "text": "SEOUL \u2014 A new army of South Korean soldiers was intently focused on fending off the enemy attack. Where were they coming from? What tactics were they using? And how best to neutralize them?\n\nThe attackers were probably North Korean \u2014 that\u2019s a given on this divided peninsula, which remains stuck in a state of war \u2014 but those manning the defenses weren\u2019t armed conscripts along the demilitarized zone. No, they were some of South Korea\u2019s savviest computer whizzes, and they were dealing with that most 21st century of invasions: the cyberattack.\n\n\u201cI do think about how I\u2019m going to defend us against an attack from North Korea,\u201d said Lee Kyung-won, a 16-year-old high school student from Suwon who was part of a team fighting a hypothetical cyberwar during a \u201cwhite hat\u201d hacking competition here this week.\n\nHaving endured numerous cyberattacks \u2014 apparently stemming from North Korea \u2014 in recent years, South Korea is bolstering its technological defenses.\n\nThe National Intelligence Service and the defense ministry have this month been hosting a competition to find computer geniuses to use their skills for good \u2014 hence the \u201cwhite hats\u201d \u2014 by intercepting attacks from nefarious \u201cblack hat\u201d hackers.\n\nAfter several preliminary rounds, 16 teams made it to the finals on Wednesday. The winners, to be announced Monday, will share $60,000 in prize money. They will get preferential treatment when they apply for intelligence or police jobs, and younger ones could work in the cyber command center during their compulsory military service.\n\nWhile the international community worries about North Korea and its unchecked nuclear weapons program, Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime has in fact proven itself to be much more adept at, and much more willing to use, cyberwarfare. His regime was blamed for the devastating attack on Sony Pictures at the end of last year, which exposed corporate e-mails and wiped out computer data.\n\n[FBI director offers new evidence to back claim North Korea hacked Sony]\n\nBut it is also accused of being behind umpteen attacks on its southern adversary, from paralyzing computer networks at South Korean banks and television stations to hacking into the South\u2019s nuclear reactor operator. Just this month, North Korea was blamed for attempting to break into networks at the presidential Blue House and at lawmakers\u2019 offices.\n\nSouth Korea, with the fastest Internet and highest broadband penetration in the world, has long been famed for its technological prowess. But North Korea, a closed country where only a handful of elites have access to the Internet, has also proven to be surprisingly skilled with computers, thanks to a dedicated cyberarmy.\n\nHence Seoul\u2019s need to train \u201cgood hackers\u201d capable of defending South Korea\u2019s front lines in cyberspace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like taekwondo,\u201d said Kim Nam-soo of the defense ministry, referring to the Korean martial art. \u201cIf you study for many years and you have the skills, you can become a gangster. But if you are trained in a different way, you can use your skills for good purposes. It\u2019s the same with these people. If we raise them as white hat hackers, they can help the government.\u201d\n\nThe finals were held in a hotel ballroom, where techies sat on an elevated platform in the middle of the room watching the cyberwar play out. They had infected the competitors\u2019 computers with malware before the day\u2019s events began, then used it to try to attack their networks, first simulating corporate cyberespionage and then an attack on government computers.\n\nThe attacks all bore resemblance to ones that South Korea had actually suffered in recent years. From the control station, the organizers watched remotely as the teams tried to defend their networks, awarding and deducting points depending on their skill.\n\n\u201cTheir job is to find out what the malware does and then try to stop it,\u201d Kim said.\n\nThe \u201cwhite hat hackers\u201d had managed to turn the ballroom, with its chandeliers and loud carpet, into the stereotypical computer geek\u2019s den.\n\nElectronic music pumped out of the sound system and their tables were littered with empty energy drink cans, half-drunk cups of coffee, candy wrappers. On their screens, rows of text scrolled past. The men \u2014 and they were all male, the few female competitors having been knocked out in the early rounds \u2014 typed away furiously.\n\nOn one side of the room were eight teams of teenagers still at high school, while eight teams of adults, ranging from college freshmen and police academy recruits to 40-something computer experts, battled it out on the other side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as I thought it was going to be,\u201d said Park Ji-hoon, a college senior majoring in computer science, who was on a team with three other men from his cybersecurity club at Catholic University of Korea.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be acting like a computer emergency response team at a company, but we\u2019re just students so we haven\u2019t done anything like this before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a great chance to experience what it\u2019s like in the real world.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the room, a team called Nyan_cat, for the Korean sound for \u201cmeow,\u201d was doing better. With 800 points, they were at the top of the junior table.\n\n\u201cEverything is so new and so exciting,\u201d said Kim Yong-jin, a 17-year-old high school student from the south of the country, who had teamed up with three others he had met online. \u201cBut I'm also feeling nervous. I\u2019m worried that the other teams will catch up with us.\u201d\n\n[North Korea says it has restarted its nuclear facilities, threatens the U.S.]\n\nKim is part of a generation of South Koreans who have spent a large chunk of their lives at a computer screen. He got interested in IT while at elementary school and started programming in sixth grade, although he has reached a new level of seriousness in the last year. He now spends eight hours a day on his computer during the week and the whole weekend apart from five or so hours each night for sleeping.\n\nAsked if he\u2019d ever used his skills for less noble purposes, Kim hesitated. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I\u2019d never done it [hacking], but I\u2019ve only played practical jokes on my friends, like turning off their computers remotely.\u201d\n\nLee and his teammates in the Bullet-proof Boys team, named after a popular band, were not doing so well. \u201cI know what the problem is but we are finding it hard to respond to it,\u201d Lee said. His team had 450 points, putting them second to last.\n\nLike Kim, he said he spends every waking hour at his computer. But for school time and four hours\u2019 sleep each night, he is on hacking simulation sites, honing his skills.\n\n\u201cI want to continue studying in the cybersecurity field,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to be good enough to teach others.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the South Korean government is hoping too.\n\nSouth Korea was once an economic tiger but seems to have \u2018lost its mojo\u2019\n\nIn South Korea, a new ingredient for TV cooking shows: Men\n\nToday's coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nAnna Fifield is The Post\u2019s bureau chief in Tokyo, focusing on Japan and the Koreas.

    "text": "Republicans in the House of Representatives are planning to deny the White House the vast bulk of its request for resources to manage the surge of unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally into the US.\n\nInstead, Republicans have coalesced around a plan to provide President Barack Obama\u2019s administration with a significantly slimmed-down package designed to help agencies cope with the thousands of Central American children arriving at the border over the summer.\n\nLegislation unveiled to the House GOP during a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, authorises only $659m, far less than the $3.7bn Obama requested weeks ago or the $2.7bn that would be released in a rival Democratic bill in the Senate. And it is less than half the $1.5bn that a working group set up by the Republican House speaker, John Boehner, recently suggested needed to be spent to manage the border crisis.\n\nAccording to multiple sources in Tuesday\u2019s meeting, the bill (pdf), which appears to have the support of the majority of House Republicans, will also tweak an 2008 anti-trafficking law that critics say significantly slows the deportation of children arriving from Central American countries.\n\nDemocrats are opposed to tweaking the anti-trafficking law, arguing it contains important provisions that guard against sex trafficking and ensure due process for children who may have valid claims for refugee status.\n\nThe White House expressed frustration over the bill. \u201cIt falls well short of the resource request that this administration has put forward,\u201d said Josh Earnest, Obama\u2019s press secretary said.\n\nThe bill will be put to a vote in the House on Thursday, shortly before members are scheduled to leave for a five-week recess.\n\nMore than 57,000 unaccompanied children have arrived at the southwestern border from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras since last October, a major spike, although the rate has declined significantly in recent weeks.\n\nHal Rogers, the Republican chair of the House appropriations committee and co-author of the bill, said the funds it makes available to the administration were curtailed partly because the legislation is intended only to get the administration through the fiscal year, which ends in September. The issue would be revisited in the Fall.\n\nHowever, speaking to reporters after he unveiled his plan to his fellow Republicans, Rogers conceded that much of the reduction was intended to placate fiscal conservatives in his party.\n\nConservative Republicans, who have been the most vocal and trenchant critics of the border crisis are, conversely, those most opposed to spending money to manage the crisis. Several emerged from the meeting on Tuesday saying they would not back the package, in large part because it provides extra funding to the Obama administration, which they say cannot be trusted.\n\nInstead of releasing extra resources to enable the administration to handle the surge in young migrants \u2013 and more quickly repatriate them \u2013 conservative Republicans were arguing for a resolution that would condemn Obama\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nJohn Fleming, a Republican from Louisiana, said he would back nothing more than the minimal funds required to keep relevant agencies going through the summer. \u201cBeyond that, I don\u2019t see any purpose spending a lot of money allowing the president to continue his malicious activities with our immigration laws,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite reluctance in conservative quarters, sources close to the Republican leadership said they believed the bill would pass \u2013 and that it could get some support from Democrats who represent border states.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s sufficient support in the House to move this bill,\u201d Boehner said after the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a little more work to do, though.\u201d\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether Senate Democrats would accept the Republican legislation \u2013 or whether a middle-ground between the two competing bills can be reached.\n\nCongress is due to go into recess at the end of the week, setting up a potential showdown over the border crisis, with both sides eager to show they are willing to take practical action.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got the votes to pass this in the House. I trust and hope the Senate will take that bill,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cAm I optimistic? I want to be.\u201d\n\nTwo thirds of the money in the bill, according to sources involved in its drafting, relates to border security. It will double the money available to the National Guard, pay for more judges and video conference facilities to deal with immigration hearings, and supply more equipment \u2013 particularly vehicles. It should pay for roughly 6,000 extra beds for children.\n\nAround a third is categorised as funding for \u201chumanitarian\u201d purposes \u2013 the care of the children, many of whom are fleeing violence and extreme poverty in El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras. Granger said one key objective was to move children off the military bases that have been converted into temporary detention facilities.\n\nThe legislation does not include two provisions included in the Senate bill as sweeteners to attract votes, funding to deal with wild fires and additional support for Israel\u2019s iron dome defence system.",

    "text": "There\u2019s a lot of shock and horror about Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to say during Wednesday night\u2019s debate that he\u2019d accept the result of the Nov. 8 vote. The outcry overstates the danger this poses to American democracy. European democracies have been dealing with this kind of threat in recent years, and have survived nicely.\n\nAfter its candidate Norbert Hofer lost the May 22 presidential election by 30,863 votes, Austria\u2019s anti-immigrant Freedom Party challenged the result and the nation\u2019s constitutional court overturned it. It ruled that mail-in ballots had been treated improperly in most electoral districts: Opened earlier than allowed by law or handled by unauthorized people. The election was supposed to be re-run this month, but it has been postponed again until December because it was discovered that adhesive seals on postal ballots were coming unglued.\n\nOn Oct. 17, the four opposition parties of Montenegro -- mostly opposed to the government\u2019s foreign-policy affinity for the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- refused to recognize the results of the previous day\u2019s general election, which the governing party apparently won with 41 percent of the vote. They spoke of massive abuses and a police intimidation campaign. The government countered with claims that the Kremlin had financed the anti-NATO opposition. Sound familiar?\n\nThe Austrian and Montenegrin populists are those countries\u2019 Trumpists. It\u2019s not unusual for them to challenge election results. Trump is doing what the same breed of politician does in Europe without being accused of undermining democracy. In its ruling, the Austrian constitutional court stressed that it was overturning the election result to strengthen, not weaken, trust in democratic institutions.\n\nAt this point, Americans are probably wondering if I\u2019m seriously comparing their country to tiny, relatively young democracies such as Austria and Montenegro. The former, after all, has been a republic for less than 100 years with a break for Nazi rule, and the latter has only been a separate country for 10 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been around for 240 years,\u201d Hillary Clinton declared proudly in response to Trump\u2019s stated intention to reserve judgment on the vote\u2019s outcome until it takes place. \u201cWe\u2019ve had free and fair elections. We\u2019ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.\u201d\n\nThat argument has been undermined by recent events in the U.K., a country that has been electing parliaments for more than 300 years. Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, who has actually campaigned with Trump despite claiming to disagree with him on a number of issues, was one of the biggest champions of the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Like Trump, he prepared for a defeat at the polls: He said a narrow loss wouldn\u2019t be conclusive. \u201cIn a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way,\u201d Farage told the Daily Mirror. \u201cIf the Remain campaign win two-thirds to one-third, that ends it.\u201d\n\nHad the Brexit vote gone against them, the nationalists would have fought on, probably forcing recounts and in any case calling for a new referendum.\n\nTrump-like politicians in Europe often say creepy things and are beset with personal problems. Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache got in trouble a few years ago for calling Austrian nationalists \u201cthe new Jews\u201d who are persecuted by the left and the liberal press. French National Front leader Marine Le Pen has made nastier statements than Trump about Muslims, and she\u2019s fought to distance herself from her anti-Semitic father, the party\u2019s founder. Flamboyant Farage doesn\u2019t just match Trump\u2019s rhetoric -- he has a reputation as a hard drinker and a ladies\u2019 man. Boris Johnson, another prominent Brexiter and now the U.K.\u2019s foreign minister, is famous for insulting foreign leaders and entire countries. He\u2019s also fathered a daughter out of wedlock and had a number of affairs, which he -- like Trump with the recent accusations of sexual misconduct -- at first denied.\n\nClinton recently penned an op-ed about American exceptionalism for Time magazine. \u201cMost of all, America is \u00adindispensable \u2014 and exceptional \u2014 because of our values,\u201d she wrote. Trump apparently doesn\u2019t believe that, and no wonder: He\u2019s living proof that, value-wise and politically, much of the U.S. is just like Europe, and it doesn\u2019t matter what part of Europe -- the west with its venerable democratic traditions or the younger, more tumultuous east and south.\n\nBy that yardstick, there\u2019s nothing so exceptional about Trump, either. He is part of a backlash against globalism and ascendant anti-racist and feminist values. Those who lead that backlash fight hard and challenge rules everywhere.\n\nOne could say that Trump is remarkable for getting as close to the White House as he has, but that should be written off to the peculiarities of the U.S. winner-take-all political system. He didn\u2019t start gaining majorities in Republican primary elections until most of his rivals dropped out, and a European parliamentary democracy probably would have held him to a 20 percent result -- just about the current limit for such politicians in Europe\u2019s important votes (Brexit and, to a lesser degree, the Austrian election were exceptions). That\u2019s because the U.S. is unexceptional in one more important respect: Like most European democracies, it appears to be capable of defending its rules and its dominant values against populist backlash. Clinton\u2019s advantage in the polls is a clear sign of that similarity.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Leonid Bershidsky at lbershidsky@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jonathan Landman at jlandman4@bloomberg.net",

On November 22 queues will be inevitable as the cards are sold for \u00a340 each on a first-come first-served basis, although there is a raffle to get in the first 50 places. Buyers could end up with a pleasing investment, or a worthless doodle by someone who will never be heard of outside family and friends.\n\nIn the event's 15-year history more than \u00a31m has been raised, helping hundreds of emerging artists at an early stage of their careers. Professor Glynn Williams, head of fine art at the RCA, called it \"one of the most democratic art sales in the world - everyone has an equal chance of getting a big name\".",

    "text": "Inside the darkened shell of the original Filene\u2019s store, Debra Taylor Blair glimpsed the beginning of a new life for downtown Boston.\n\nSeated before her was an unusual crowd for this part of the city: more than 80 residential real estate brokers, all of whom had accepted the housing researcher\u2019s invitation for a tour of the Filene\u2019s site and others around the district where new housing is planned.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time so many residential brokers have come out to take a fresh look at this area,\u201d said Blair, president of LINK, a real estate information service. \u201cWe were totally shocked by the turnout.\u201d\n\nPromised for years, the revitalization of the city\u2019s long-struggling downtown is \u00adfinally underway, with construction of residential towers transforming the largely commercial area into a full-blown neighborhood. The supply of housing is planned to double to more than 10,000 units in coming years, according to the Boston Redevelopment Authority, and there is a sudden influx of retail shops and restaurants.\n\n\u201cThere are so many deals going on, so many new people and businesses interested in downtown,\u201d said Randi Lathrop, the BRA\u2019s deputy director of community planning. \u201cEvery day I get a phone call about someone else who wants to open here.\u201d\n\nThe construction of homes is particularly important to changing the neighborhood, as it will bring around-the-clock \u00adactivity to streets that today feel desolate after the workday ends.\n\nTwo residential towers are under construction and a third is planned at Filene\u2019s, where developers have won approval for a 625-foot apartment and condominium tower that will become a new marker on the downtown skyline.\n\nMeanwhile, Mayor Thomas M. Menino\u2019s administration is pumping millions of tax dollars into road and sidewalk repairs, new lighting, and other upgrades. Those public works complement new investments by property owners, who recently received government approval\u00ad to form a so-called business improvement district to provide better upkeep of the neighborhood. The major performance theaters have been modernized, and new technology tenants are bringing a younger workforce to the area.\n\nThe Kensington, an apartment tower being constructed near where Chinatown meets Downtown Crossing, will feature a pool, solarium, and yoga lounge.\n\nLisa Macalaster, a sales associate with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage, said that downtown is finally emerging as a viable housing alternative to Boston\u2019s other neighborhoods, where a shortage of available units is pushing buyers to look elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThis feels like the next exciting rebirth of Boston,\u201d she said during the recent tour of the area. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand for housing right now.\u201d\n\nThe downtown\u2019s renaissance remains a work in progress, however. Several streets are pockmarked with empty storefronts, and the area lacks a critical mass of modern shopping options. But five years after the Big Dig reshaped nearby streets, the next wave of improvements and construction is reaching into downtown\u2019s side streets and pedestrian thoroughfares.\n\nMore than 600 housing units are under construction at the edge of what was once the Combat Zone.\n\nAcross the street from the strip club Centerfolds is the Kensington, a 381-unit apartment tower that will feature an outdoor pool, solarium, and \u00adyoga lounge for young, affluent renters.\n\nA block away on Washington Street, a 15-story residential building is rising across from the Ritz Carlton Residences. The complex, known as Millennium Place, will include 256 luxury condominiums, a winetasting room, and outdoor gardens.\n\nAnd soon to tower above them all is the Filene\u2019s project, on which construction is scheduled to begin next year. Its developers have won approval for what would be the tallest residential building in Boston.\n\nEstimated to cost $620 million, the project will add up to 600 housing units as well as offices and retail stores at the base of the tower and behind the facade of original 1912 Filene\u2019s building.\n\nNearby, 59 Temple Place is being renovated as a 240-room boutique hotel, while Hamilton Co. is transforming an office building at 8 Winter St. into 50 mid-priced apartments. Even though construction is ongoing, 40 percent of the Winter Street units are rented.\n\nHarold Brown, Hamilton Co.\u2019s president, said that downtown has improved considerably since the mid-1990s, when Menino first began trying to spruce it up.\n\n\u201cIf the downtown is seven or eight now, it was a two back then,\u201d he said.\n\nCity officials are hoping the wave of construction brings much-needed retail staples, such as a supermarket, as well as stores that don\u2019t currently operate in the area.\n\nAmong the retailers coming soon is Walgreen Co., which is opening an emporium next year at Washington and School streets with an expansive natural foods section, a sushi bar, and a hair and nail salon.\n\nPret A Manger , the British prepared foods chain, recently opened an outlet at Post Office Square.\n\nThe largest concentration of new retail space will be at the former site of Filene\u2019s, where at least 100,000 square feet will be added \u2014 enough for a supermarket and multiple restaurants and stores. A former Barnes & Noble bookstore is \u00adalso available across the street, and the owners of Lafayette City Center are planning to convert part of the office complex into retail space.\n\nDuring the recent real estate tour, several brokers said they are beginning to recommend that clients look for properties downtown. Among the options is 45 Province St. Completed in 2009, the 137-unit tower initially struggled to attract buyers; today, 70 percent of its condominium units are sold or are under agreement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding a greater awareness of all the things going on in this part of the city,\u201d said Wayne Lopez, the building\u2019s sales director. \u201cThe downtown\u2019s live-work dynamic is really starting to catch on.\u201d",

    "text": "A few weeks ago, I taught a social-justice workshop for African-American teenage girls from Chicago\u2019s West Side. They all attend school in North Lawndale, one of the city\u2019s most impoverished neighborhoods, and many of them have experienced hostile or violent interactions with the police. But because they are girls, not boys, they\u2019ve told me, most people in their community do not take those interactions seriously.\n\nDuring my three weeks in Chicago, I saw this phenomenon play out in real time. On July 10, Sandra Bland, an African-American woman originally from the nearby suburb of Naperville, was pulled over for a minor traffic violation in Texas, where she had recently relocated for a new job. Two weeks after her arrest, I attended her funeral.\n\nOver the past few months, I have visited a number of locations where encounters with the police led to the deaths of unarmed African-Americans: the Chicago park in which Rekia Boyd was shot; the street on which Michael Brown died in Ferguson, Mo.; the corner in Baltimore where Freddie Gray was arrested before his death in police custody. In all of these places, I felt a strange incongruity \u2014 the cavity of young lives violently snatched away by cops amid unceasing quotidian activity. That emptiness did not elude me at the funeral, but the specific space for mourning moved me \u2014 I could grieve for her body without the intrusive normalcy of the outside world.\n\nBland, who was found dead of an alleged suicide in her jail cell three days after her arrest \u2014 the results of the independent autopsy her family ordered have not been released \u2014 is another entry in this grim litany, though she stood out for having railed against it herself before her death. Last January, Bland started the video blog #SandySpeaks on Facebook to discuss a range of personal and political topics, especially those concerning race in America, including a critique of the #AllLivesMatter hashtag. Still, she longed to have an even bigger role in the movement. \u201cHer purpose was to stop all injustice against blacks in the South,\u201d her mother, Geneva Reed-Veal, told the crowd that gathered to mourn Bland at the DuPage African Methodist Episcopal Church in greater Chicago. Reed-Veal has filed a federal lawsuit against the state trooper who arrested Bland and the jail guards who were responsible for her.\n\nDespite the wrenching heat, mourners, mostly African-American women, packed the church from balcony to basement. I watched the services in the church\u2019s overflow room with one of the girls from the workshop. A 16-year-old aspiring photographer, she documented Bland\u2019s funeral for a social documentary project that she was doing on black girlhood. She originally wanted to photograph the site where Rekia Boyd, the unarmed 22-year-old who was fatally shot in the back of the head by the off-duty police officer Dante Servin, died in 2012, but Boyd\u2019s death garnered scant attention in the weeks that followed. Even today, there are no tributes for her in the Chicago park. In comparison, there is already a large-scale mural memorializing Gray at the corner of North Mount and Presbury in Baltimore, and the protesters and pilgrims cycling through Ferguson created a makeshift shrine for Brown. A permanent plaque now memorializes the tragedy.\n\nThis disparity between the remembrance of Boyd and those of the others reflects a popular conception that racial discrimination and violence in America, past and present, are almost exclusively aimed at men: When we talk about lynching, police brutality and mass incarceration, we are almost always talking about African-American men, not women. Being a target of racism is seen as patrilineal, a social and political disadvantage that black fathers unwillingly bequeath to their sons but not their daughters. The result is a dyad of vulnerability and invisibility that most African-American women, including me, learn to navigate at an early age.\n\nThis exclusion has also been true of the paramount social-justice movement of the moment, #BlackLivesMatter. Two years after its inception, few people remember that it originated with three black female activists, Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi. But nearly all of the victims of police violence whose cases have been made causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres by the movement have been men \u2014 despite the fact in 2015 alone, at least six black women have died in or after encounters with the police.\n\nSadly, this erasure of women seems far-reaching: Last year, the #WhyWeCan\u2019tWait campaign argued against the exclusion of African-American girls from President Obama\u2019s singular racial-justice initiative, My Brother\u2019s Keeper, while some critics have accused author Ta-Nehisi Coates of marginalizing black women altogether in \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d his profound meditation against American racism. \u201cBlack womanhood in real life isn\u2019t \u2014 as it largely is in \u2018Between the World and Me\u2019 \u2014 about beating and loving and mourning black men and protecting oneself from physical plunder,\u201d writes Shani Hilton on BuzzFeed, in response to Coates\u2019s book. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to live free in a black body, just like a man.\u201d\n\nIn turn, black women have responded to this flattening by making themselves more visible. The #SayHerName campaign \u2014 the movement within a movement that helped to elevate the profile of Bland\u2019s case and that of other African-American girls and women \u2014 has emerged as a response to this dearth of coverage. A few days after Bland\u2019s funeral, hundreds of protesters staged a rally for Bland just north of the Chicago River. Some demonstrators held up LED-lit letters spelling Bland\u2019s name and the hashtag \u201c#SayHerName\u201d on the Michigan Avenue Bridge, while others shouted, \u201cWe do this for Sandra! We do this for Rekia!\u201d And in the fall, many of these organizers will build a shrine to memorialize Boyd at Chicago\u2019s Douglas Park.\n\nThere is no clearer example of black women strategizing against their invisibility than the recent actions of the filmmaker and activist Bree Newsome. On June 27, when she climbed the flagpole outside the South Carolina Statehouse, removed the Confederate flag and was arrested, she created one of most indelible images of activism this summer. Explaining her actions, Newsome was quick to underscore the importance of her gender: \u201cIt was decided that this role should go to a black woman and that a white man should be the one to help her over the fence as a sign that our alliance transcended both racial and gender divides,\u201d she wrote in a statement regarding her actions. \u201cI did it for all the fierce black women on the front lines of the movement and for all the little black girls who are watching us.\u201d",

    "text": "Many expectant parents are wary of all the recommended vaccines their newborns are supposed to get in the first hours, days and even the first couple of years, believing that too many vaccines too soon may increase their child's risk for autism.\n\nA new study published in the Journal of Pediatrics Friday may put them at ease. Researchers found no association between autism and the number of vaccines a child gets in one day or during the first two years of the current vaccine schedule.\n\nThe research was led by Dr. Frank DeStefano, director of the Immunization Safety Office at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Together with two colleagues, DeStefano and his team collected data on 256 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 752 children who did not have autism. The children were all born between 1994 and 1999 and were all continuously enrolled in one of three managed-care organizations through their second birthday.\n\nThe researchers not only counted how many vaccines a child was given, they also counted how many antigens within the vaccines children were exposed to over three different time periods: birth to 3 months, birth to 7 months and during the first two years. They also calculated the maximum number of antigens a child would receive over the course of a single day.\n\nAn antigen is an immune-stimulating protein found in a vaccine that prompts the body's immune system to recognize and destroy substances that contain them, according to the NIH.\n\nSome vaccines, like Hepatitis B, only contain one antigen for this one virus. However, at the time these children were vaccinated, the typhoid vaccine had 3,000 antigens per dose and the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine had 24.\n\n\"When we compared those roughly 250 children with ASD and the roughly 750 children who did not have ASD, we found their antigen exposure, however measured, were the same,\" said DeStefano. \u201cThere was no association between antigenic exposure and the development of autism.\"\n\nThe researchers also found no association between antigenic exposure and ASD.\n\nGeraldine Dawson, chief science officer of the science and advocacy group Autism Speaks, called the research a \"well-done study.\" She was not affiliated with the research.\n\n\"The big challenge that we face is the fact that we still don't understand the causes of autism - genetic or environmental,\" she said. \"So while this answers one question parents may have, we still have many more to be addressed.\"\n\nDawson and DeStefano both believe the study should be reassuring for parents concerned about the vaccine schedule. Vocal critics have argued that children receive too many vaccines too soon, and that the frequency of the shots is one factor in why some children develop autism.\n\n\"I would tell an expectant mom that one of the more important things you can do to protect an infant's health is get them vaccinated on time according to the recommended schedule,\" DeStefano said. He says vaccines protect against serious life-threatening diseases and delaying them can put your child unnecessarily at risk.\n\n\"The bottom line is the number of vaccines, or the number of antigens in the current schedule, given on time ... is not associated with a risk of autism.\"\n\nIn 2011, the British medical journal BMJ said a now-retracted study linking autism to the vaccine that prevents measles, mumps and rubella was an \"elaborate fraud\" that did long-lasting damage to public health. An investigation by the journal said the study's author, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, misrepresented or altered the medical histories of all 12 patients whose cases formed the basis of the 1998 study.\n\nWakefield told CNN's \"AC360\" that his work had been \"grossly distorted\" and he was the target of a \"ruthless, pragmatic attempt to crush any attempt to investigate valid vaccine safety concerns.\"\n\nThe now-discredited paper panicked parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of children getting the vaccine. Measles cases increased in the ensuing years.",

    "text": "Every summer during high school, Brittani Manzo, now 22 and a student at New York University, had a 9-to-5 job--sitting in the sun as a badge checker at the entrance to the beach in Bay Head, N.J.\n\nOf the four seasons she spent there, Manzo says, \"It was almost like it was my job to get a tan.\"\n\nWhile teens might be forgiven for letting sun safety slip, those in the medical field say adults should know better. That's because skin cancers account for almost 50% of all cancers in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. The majority of them result from unprotected skin exposure to UV radiation.\n\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that in 2006, the last year for which data was available, 59,940 cases of malignant melanoma and over 1 million cases of basal- and squamous-cell cancers, nonmelanoma skin cancers, were associated with UV exposure.\n\nThough folks know sunbathing can be dangerous, they may not be aware of the hidden sources of skin damage. These include wearing expired sunscreen, relying on clothing to block the sun and taking certain medications.\n\nIn Pictures: 10 Sneaky Things Damaging Your Skin\n\nOther sun-damage hideouts: in the car and even under a beach umbrella. While the glass in car windows typically blocks UVB rays, which causes skin to burn, UVA rays--those that cause skin aging--can seep through, says dermatologist Dr. Francesca Fusco, associate clinical professor at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. What's more, a high percentage of UV radiation bounces directly off sand and water and on to the skin, even while you're sitting in the shade.\n\n\"UVB rays cause sunburn,\" she says, \"UVA rays cause suntan, and both of them contribute to skin damage, skin cancer and DNA mutations, which predisposes to cancer.\"\n\nUVA rays also penetrate clouds more readily than UVB rays, putting those that head outdoors, even on gloomy days, at risk of a burn or other skin damage.\n\n\"A typical white T-shirt offers you about a 7 to 8 SPF,\" says dermatologist Dr. Susan Weinkle, a clinical associate professor at the University of South Florida. \"And then when it gets wet, the sun protective factor goes down to a 3.\"\n\nWhat outdoorsy people may not know is that special clothing can shield the skin from such rays. Companies including Columbia Sportswear ( COLM - news - people ) and Lands' End recently launched collections that provide Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) protection. Columbia's and Lands' End's lines both offer UPF 50, which protects the wearer from 97.5% of the sun's rays. Both companies also offer UPF 30, and Columbia offers UPF 15, which protects the wearer from up to 93.3% of UV rays.\n\nOf course, the best way to protect against skin damage while doing any kind of activity that exposes skin to the sun is to wear sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15.\n\n\"SPF 15 will confer 95% protection,\" says Fusco. \"When you jump to SPF 30, it goes to 97%, and when you go to 50, it goes to 98%.\"\n\nThe importance of wearing sunscreen is increasingly evident. Incidences of melanoma of the skin increased by 7.7.% among men from 2003 to 2005, and by 2.9% among women from 1993 to 2005, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWith these statistics in mind, it is not only dermatologists like Fusco who emphasize the importance of protecting skin. In addition to clothing lines, personal care companies are also becoming more sensitive to the importance of UV protection.\n\nCompanies such as Neutrogena and L'Or\u00e9al are increasing the spectrum of coverage. A daily moisturizer by L'Or\u00e9al called Revitalift UV, for example, provides broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection. It also contains Memoryl SX (Ecamsule) and Avobenzone, ingredients that help protect the skin from both short and long wavelengths of UVA rays, according to the company.\n\nCompanies \"are improving the ability of sunscreen to block UVA and UVB rays,\" says Weinkle. They're also using ingredients that allow sunscreen to better stay put on skin, which helps block UV rays more effectively.\n\nIn Pictures: 10 Sneaky Things Damaging Your Skin",

    "text": "Jennifer Richards of Park Ridge, Ill., is angry that her family's monthly health insurance bill tripled in August to $1,250 after her husband lost his job and health benefits. But as bad as that is, what really upsets her is the inaction of Congress.\n\nDeficit-conscious lawmakers have not renewed a subsidy that helped many jobless Americans afford health benefits. A longstanding federal law called COBRA requires employers to continue insurance for former employees, typically for 18 more months, if they pay the entire premium plus a 2% administrative fee. Last year, Congress approved a 65% COBRA premium subsidy, but it ended May 31.\n\nPeople who started on COBRA before May 31 can still get the aid. But those who had exhausted the 15-month subsidy, and the newly unemployed, aren't eligible.\n\nRichards says she has no other way to get health coverage except for COBRA: Other insurers won't cover her because of her diabetes and high blood pressure. The subsidy would have kept her family's insurance bill to $438. Now, she's worried about being able to pay college tuition for her 18-year-old daughter, Erica. \"It's very upsetting,\" she said.\n\nThere's little chance that the subsidy will be renewed this election year, because Congress is in recess and little time remains in the session. But with the economy still struggling and layoffs continuing, hundreds of thousands of Americans may face a tough decision: Pay high COBRA premiums or drop coverage if they can't get cheaper individual policies.\n\nFinding affordable insurance can be tough. The average price for family coverage is about $1,100 a month, according to the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. With the subsidy, COBRA coverage costs $385.\n\nLaid-off workers looking for insurance will get little immediate help under the new health care law, which will sharply expand coverage, but not until 2014. A provision that sets up high-risk insurance pools for people with health problems who can't get insurance also won't help people on COBRA because applicants must have been uninsured for six months to qualify.\n\nMeanwhile, getting private health insurance on the individual market poses its own challenges. Until 2014, insurers can still reject adults with medical problems or charge them much steeper rates.\n\nRichards and her husband, Ron, who lost his job at an energy services company in July, feel they have little choice but to pay the steep COBRA costs, because both have diabetes.\n\n\"I am terrified about living without health insurance,\" she said.\n\nThe politics of the matter\n\nThe Obama administration says it favors extending the subsidy but is having trouble winning support among lawmakers of both parties who are worried about the federal deficit and are hard-pressed to find ways to pay for the additional cost.\n\n\"Views on fiscal matters seem to have shifted, and the electorate wants its political leaders to start reining some things back in,\" said James Capretta, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank.\n\nTrying to address those concerns, Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Robert Casey, D-Pa., have introduced a bill to reinstate the subsidy and pay for it by eliminating a tax break on annuity trusts. The proposal would be retroactive, giving people laid off since June 1 six months of the subsidy instead of the 15 months that the law had provided.\n\nExtending the subsidy enrollment through November would cost as much as $4 billion and help about 150,000 families each month, according to estimates from the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group.\n\nBut \"prospects for extending the subsidy are rather slim,\" says staunch advocate Ron Pollack, executive director of the liberal consumer group Families USA.\n\nThe political problems go beyond budgetary issues. \"There is a huge backlash,\" says Randy Bovbjerg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. While the COBRA subsidy was helpful to those who qualified, most of the unemployed were not eligible, he says. They did not work for a large company that provided benefits before being laid off, or they lost their job before the subsidies began. Employers with 20 or more employees are required to offer COBRA under federal law. Most states have laws that also include smaller employers. \"People are mad, and people see the recovery only helping the big companies, banks and high earners.\"\n\nNina Owcharenko, director of the conservative Heritage Foundation's Center for Health Policy Studies, put it this way: \"There is a lack of equity in this arrangement.\"\n\nLinda Vollmer doesn't see it that way. The Sylmar, Calif., woman says she'll have to go on COBRA in October because she's losing her coverage through the Los Angeles Unified School District, where she works as a substitute elementary school teacher. The district has been paying her entire premium. Now she'll soon owe about $400 a month.\n\nShe lost her coverage because she didn't work enough days in the last school year to qualify for benefits this year. Vollmer, 52, has searched for individual coverage, but insurers are unwilling to cover her because she has a history of skin cancer.\n\n\"I would like Congress to keep up the subsidy because it is still a hard time out there finding work,\" she said. \"If they can find the money for two wars, they should be able to find the money for this.\"\n\nSeveral studies show that the subsidy led to more eligible people signing up for COBRA. Before Congress approved the subsidy in February 2009, about 19% of those eligible took advantage of the program; since then, that figure has doubled to 39%, according to Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm. Ceridian, another benefits firm, found the rate increased from 12% to 18%. Hewitt surveyed mostly large firms, averaging 40,000 employees each. Ceridian's survey was among employers with an average of 150 workers.\n\nAble to see both sides\n\nDiana Hagenbaugh's COBRA subsidy just expired after 15 months. Her August insurance premium rose from $153 to $455 a month for individual coverage. Before she pays the bill, the 50-year-old Redding, Calif., woman hopes to find a lower-cost plan.\n\nWhen her husband was laid off from his banking job in May 2009, they both lost his employer health benefits. He was able to get Medicare because he's 66; she turned to COBRA.\n\nAlthough Hagenbaugh is concerned about higher insurance costs, she is not angry with Congress.\n\n\"I can see this issue from both sides,\" she said. \"Right now, I need insurance ... but I certainly understand how we can't keep running up the deficit.\"\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service and a program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan health care policy organization.

    "text": "LOS ANGELES -- On Aug. 21, thousands of fans crammed into Imax theaters around the country to watch an ad. The event was \"Avatar Day,\" sponsored by 20th Century Fox. Director James Cameron unveiled 16 minutes of his forthcoming 3-D sci-fi movie Avatar. Theaters were filled to capacity--in fact, hundreds of people were unable to get the free tickets.\n\nWhen you can cause that kind of commotion just by showing a long trailer, it's worth taking notice. Avatar is the most anticipated movie of the year by a long stretch. Fans are watching to see if Cameron, the man behind Aliens, Terminator and Titanic, can once again deliver the goods when Avatar hits theaters Dec. 18. Hollywood is watching to see if moviegoers will turn a live-action 3-D movie into a Transformers-size hit. Since 3-D movies command on average an extra $3 per ticket, if the same number of people were to see Avatar in 3-D as saw Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, that would mean an extra $168 million at the box office.\n\nAccording to Piper Jaffray analyst James Marsh, there's a way for investors to profit from all this hype. If Avatar is a bona fide hit, studios will start pumping out many more 3-D films. However, there are only around 2,700 3-D screens out there right now. That's not enough for a wide release, which usually requires at least 3,000 screens.\n\nThat bottleneck could be about to clear. JPMorgan Chase ( JPM - news - people ) is raising roughly $750 million in debt and equity to fund the installation of more digital projectors at an average cost of $100,000 per screen. The money will be repaid by a flow of \"virtual print fees\" from the studios. It costs around $1,500 to send a celluloid print to a theater today. Sending a film digitally costs only a few hundred dollars (and will eventually cost almost nothing). So the studios have agreed to pay $1,000 per shipped digital film to pay back investors.\n\nMarsh projects that the JPMorgan deal will help boost the number of digital screens (3-D movies are only shown digitally) to 3,750 by the end of the year and 8,000 by the end of 2010.\n\nThe companies poised to gain the most from the massive roll out are theater chains.\n\n\"Theaters have historically been seen as a low-risk growth business,\" says Marsh. \"Kind of boring. But with 3-D and digital, there's the start of a growth trend.\"\n\nCarmike Cinemas ( CKEC - news - people ) has embarked on the most aggressive digital expansion of any of the theater chains. The Georgia-based company, which has a market cap of $127 million, operates theaters in small towns like Manhattan, Kan., and Conway, Ark.--not exactly the kinds of places one would expect to go to for a state-of-the-art theater experience. But a full 93% of Carmike's 2,285 screens are digital, and 500 are equipped for 3-D.\n\nAt $10.04 per share at Thursday's close, the company's stock is near its 52-week high and above Marsh's target of $9. But if Hollywood starts making more 3-D films, Carmike could see a big jump in revenue. Marsh believes that 3-D could add $10 million to incremental cash flow by 2010.\n\nCarmike is also well positioned to use its digital screens for what theater owners are calling \"alternative content\": sports, operas and concerts. In January, the company showed the FedEx BCS National Football Championship game between the University of Florida and the University of Oklahoma in 30 theaters in 3-D. Even though the game was on TV, it still sold out in the theaters at $20 per ticket.\n\nRegal Entertainment Group ( RGC - news - people ) is the largest cinema chain, with 6,778 screens and a $1.9 billion market cap. So far Regal has moved into digital less aggressively than Carmike. The company has only 300 theaters equipped for 3-D, compared to Carmike's 500. But with a stock priced at $12.13, Regal is trading well under Marsh's target price of $19. Regal has the most to gain from the JPMorgan deal, which will give billionaire owner Philip Anschutz the ability to quickly upgrade lots of theaters without taking on a lot of debt.\n\nAnother company that could benefit from the 3-D revolution is Imax ( IMAX - news - people ). The Canadian maker of huge screens ($542 million market cap) has found a way to bring Imax to the masses by partnering with theater chains like Regal to convert multiplex screens into the Imax format. The screens are smaller than the massive, standalone Imax theaters that are often found next to museums. But they are always the biggest screen in the theater and often show movies in 3-D.\n\nThe company has been on an expansion tear, growing from 183 of these smaller screens last year to 273 today. That's helped boost Imax's revenue 67% for the first half of the year to $74 million. At a share price of $9.75, Imax is near its 52-week high of $10.14. Marsh doesn't have a rating on the company, but he says Imax is an important part of the trend to make movies a special, outside the home experience.\n\n\"The fear for exhibitors early on was that home entertainment would become a substitute for going to the movies,\" says Marsh. \"But whether it's Imax or 3-D, you can't easily replicate that at home. It makes it more of an event.\"",

    "text": "It is the great, democratic virtue of presidential campaigns that they subject candidates to every kind of stress, eventually revealing their core, their character. For Donald Trump, the test has been political success. After leading the Republican field for six months, and in some quarters receiving adulation nearly equal to his self-regard, how has Trump responded? Has he been sobered? Have his rhetoric and temperament matured?\n\nNo. Decidedly, no. The realistic prospect of executive power has only increased Trump\u2019s swagger. He has threatened a Republican donor who opposes him. \u201cI hear the [Ricketts] family,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cwho own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $\u2019s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!\u201d\n\nMichael Gerson is a nationally syndicated columnist who appears twice weekly in The Post.\n\nTrump has threatened the media, promising to \u201copen up our libel laws\u201d so he can more easily sue outlets that differ in their view of the truth about him. \u201cI think the media is among the most dishonest groups of people that I\u2019ve ever met. They\u2019re terrible.\u201d he said recently. Referring specifically to The Post, he added: \u201cIf I become president, oh, do they have problems. They\u2019re going to have such problems.\u201d\n\nTrump has attempted to smear and intimidate a district judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a lawsuit for fraud against Trump University, with its distinguished faculty of cardboard cutouts and allegedly bankrupt real estate investors. Trump accuses Curiel of hostility against him because \u201cI\u2019m very, very strong on the border.\u201d Another shrill pipe of the ethnic dog whistle.\n\nThis is more than a personality disorder talking. Trump roots his intimidation in a worldview \u2014 the need for the strong hand. It is the most consistent commitment of Trumpism. As early as 1990, Trump criticized Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for not having a \u201cfirm enough hand.\u201d He cited China\u2019s butchers of Tiananmen Square as examples of his conception of power: \u201cThey were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak . . . as being spit on by the rest of the world.\u201d Following allegations last year that Russian leader Vladimir Putin had killed several high-profile journalists, Trump responded, \u201cHe\u2019s running his country and at least he\u2019s a leader, unlike what we have in this country.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s supporters seem to welcome this aspect of his appeal. According to a Vox analysis of the South Carolina Republican primary vote, the best statistical predictor of Trump support is an inclination toward authoritarianism \u2014 a belief in the need for \u201caggressive leaders and policies.\u201d So Trump, if he wins the nomination and the presidency, will feel a mandate for his menace.\n\nThere is a moment in the 1957 movie \u201cA Face in the Crowd\u201d when a TV personality turned power-mad sociopath, Larry \u201cLonesome\u201d Rhodes, says, \u201cI\u2019m not just an entertainer. I\u2019m an influence, a wielder of opinion, a force . . . a force!\u201d On the evidence, Trump is reaching that point of intoxication.\n\nWe have seen the lengths to which Trump will go to threaten and intimidate his enemies, armed mainly with social media. It seems reckless beyond reason \u2014 reckless with the republic itself \u2014 to arm him with the immense power of the executive branch. Consider the inherently threatening quality of the words \u201cTrump\u2019s military\u201d or \u201cTrump\u2019s FBI\u201d or \u201cTrump\u2019s IRS.\u201d The grant of vast influence to a leader of such vindictive temperament is utterly frightening.\n\nIn a certain way, Trump may be excused for his adolescent view of strength \u2014 the power of the tantrum, of the crude put-down, of the dirty trick. Trump has no evident knowledge of American history or of a conservative ideology. He lives only in the vivid present of his wants and needs. He is squandering an inheritance he does not value, that he does not even understand.\n\nBut what excuse can be made for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie? His endorsement of Trump was evidently made out of pique and ambition. It is humiliating for the governor of a great state to make himself the subordinate of \u2014 the junior partner to \u2014 a cut-rate Mussolini. Christie has, in the past, shown leadership on entitlement reform and the fair treatment of Muslims. Now his enduring reputation will be a willingness to swallow any foolishness, any prejudice, to serve the cause of Christie.\n\nTrump\u2019s conception of leadership is to become large by making others small. In a reality television star, this is a job qualification. In a president, it would raise the prospect of serious damage to our democratic system.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u0097 In courtrooms barred to the public, dozens of terror suspects are pleading for their freedom from the\n\nprison, sometimes even testifying on their own behalf by video from the U.S. naval base in\n\nComplying with a Supreme Court ruling last year, 15 federal judges in the U.S. courthouse here are giving detainees their day in court after years behind bars half a world away from their homelands.\n\nThe judges have found the government's evidence against 30 detainees wanting and ordered their release. That number could rise significantly because the judges are on track to hear challenges from dozens more prisoners.\n\nScooped up along with hard-core terrorist suspects in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere, these 30 detainees stand in stark contrast to the 10 prisoners whom the Obama administration targeted for prosecution Friday for plotting the Sept. 11 and other terrorist attacks. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the professed mastermind of 9/11, and four of his alleged henchmen are headed for a federal civilian trial in New York; five others, including a top suspect in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole off Yemen, will be tried by a military commission.\n\nMore detainees are expected to soon be added to the prosecution list. But there will still be plenty of cases left among the 215 detainees now at Guantanamo to keep the judges here busy as they work to clear a legal morass the Bush administration created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nBush administration Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld once promised Guantanamo held \"the worst of the worst.\" The judges here have rejected pleas for release from eight detainees, but they have concluded the government does not even have enough evidence to keep 30 other detainees behind bars.\n\n\"There is absolutely no reason for this court to presume that the facts contained in the government's exhibits are accurate,\" District Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in ordering the release of Alla Ali Bin Ali Ahmed. He was repatriated to Yemen after a seven-year stay at Guantanamo, where he was brought as a teenager.\n\n\"Much of the factual material contained in those exhibits is hotly contested for a host of different reasons ranging from the fact that it contains second- and third-hand hearsay to allegations that it was obtained by torture to the fact that no statement purports to be a verbatim account of what was said,\" Kessler said. She ruled the government failed to prove the detainee was part of or substantially supported Taliban or al-Qaeda forces.\n\nThe evidentiary record \"is surprisingly bare,\" U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote in ordering the release of Fouad Mahmoud Al Rabiah, a 50-year-old father of four from Kuwait who had been an aviation engineer for Kuwaiti Airways for 20 years. He has been imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay since 2002.\n\nRabiah is one of dozens of men who won their cases in court or who have been cleared for transfer by the Obama administration who are still among the 215 detainees at Guantanamo. Finding countries willing to take the detainees has proven difficult. Since Obama took office, only 25 detainees have actually left.\n\nIn the case of a detainee from Syria, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon pointed to evidence that the man, Abdulrahim Abdul Razak Al Ginco, who uses the surname Janko, had been tortured repeatedly by al-Qaeda for three months into falsely confessing that he was a U.S. spy, then jailed for 18 months by the Taliban in Kandahar before he fell into the hands of U.S. forces.\n\n\"Notwithstanding these extraordinary intervening events, the government contends that Janko was still 'part of' the Taliban and/or al-Qaeda when he was taken into custody,\" Leon wrote in ordering the detainee's release. \"Surely extreme treatment of that nature evinces a total evisceration of whatever relationship might have existed!\"\n\nOne detainee who lost his bid for freedom was Adham Mohammed Ali Awad, taken into custody seven years ago when he was a teenager.\n\n\"It seems ludicrous to believe that he poses a security threat now, but that is not for me to say, \" wrote U.S. District Judge James Robertson.\n\n\"The case against Awad is gossamer thin,\" consisting of raw intelligence, multiple levels of hearsay and documents whose authenticity cannot be proven, said Robertson. \"In the end, however, it appears more likely than not that Awad was, for some period of time, 'part of' al-Qaeda.\"\n\nThe detainees' hearings \u2014 which usually last a day or two apiece \u2014 are expected to go well into next year, unless the Obama administration finds homes for them in other countries in the meantime.\n\nSome 45% of the detainees are citizens of Yemen. Afghanistan is the home country of about one in 10 detainees. Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Tunisia together are home for about one in five, according to the Pentagon.\n\nThe courthouse's Guantanamo cleanup started with the Bush administration still in office, set in motion by the district judges just days after the Supreme Court ruled that detainees could go to civilian court to challenge their indefinite detention. After two earlier Supreme Court rulings in favor of the detainees, a Republican-controlled Congress stepped in to effectively keep detainees from seeking freedom from civilian courts, but the Democratic-controlled Congress let the June 2008 ruling stand.\n\nThe district judges contacted the attorney general and the defense secretary to arrange for a secure video link to Guantanamo. A few judges have taken testimony by satellite from several detainees who wanted to speak on their own behalf.\n\nTypically, the first half hour of a detainee's hearing is open to the public, with the prisoner listening by phone. Then the courtroom doors are locked, and the judges hear classified evidence.\n\nThe 15 judges' chambers were outfitted with safes, special laptop computers and printers and each of the judges' law clerks underwent background checks and was given a security clearance to deal with classified information that dominates the evidence.\n\nOne of the last bastions of judicial opposition to the detainees is the federal appeals court on the fifth floor of the courthouse.\n\nThere, a three-judge panel ruled the judges lack authority to order the detainees released into the United States even if they have won their release and have nowhere else to go. Considered no threat to the United States, the detainees in that case are 17 Muslims, known as Uighurs. They were picked up in Afghanistan after fleeing western China and fear persecution if returned to China. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear their appeal, with a decision expected next spring. This year, the U.S. government found a home for four Uighurs in Bermuda and six on the Pacific island nation of Palau. The seven still at Guantanamo hope to live in the United States. To achieve that goal, their lawyers must persuade the Supreme Court to rule in their favor.\n\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

    "text": "Supervisor Jane Kim, a one-time ally of Mayor Ed Lee before recent tumult, saw the mayor veto her legislation that would have drawn down city reserves to help the San Francisco Unified District. (Paul Chinn / The Chronicle)\n\nFunding for after-school and summer schools programs to help make sure about 1,900 San Francisco juniors can graduate in 2014 is caught up in a political tussle not over whether schools should get the money, but where it should come from.\n\nMayor Ed Lee on Wednesday used his line-item veto power to strike out part of legislation the Board of Supervisors approved Tuesday that would have provided the programs almost $2.3 million.\n\nLee approved $1.4 million of the money, but lined out $843,000 that would have come out of the city\u2019s $15 million reserve to cover cuts in state and federal funding.\n\nThe mayor said he supported the San Francisco Unified School District\u2019s effort to meet its aggressive requirement to have all graduates qualified for state universities when they\u2019re done with high school.\n\n\u201cI do not support the use of general fund reserves \u2014 money we set aside to backfill safety net cuts from the sate & federal government \u2014 for this purpose,\u201d Lee said in his veto statement.\n\nLee instead on Tuesday introduced legislation to release an additional $1.5 million to the school district from the rain day reserve \u2014 a $31.1 million fund designed, in part, to provide financing for schools in tough times.\n\nUsing the rainy day reserve, though, is opposed by a teachers union and their ally, Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, who view it as a backstop only to be used when the district is facing state cuts that mean severe layoffs.\n\n\u201cIf we use rainy day money now, we may not have the funds when dire circumstances occur,\u201d Ammiano wrote in a recent opinion piece in The Chronicle. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse, it sets a precedent for raiding the rainy day fund for something other than its intended purpose. Once the controls are loosened, others may fall to the same temptation and raid the fund repeatedly.\u201d\n\nWith a $7.6 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts in July, $843,000 isn\u2019t a huge amount of money. But City Hall players say this dispute is really just a skirmish in advance of upcoming budget battles, with the mayor laying out a firm line that the general fund isn\u2019t going to be raided at will.\n\nEven though the city is facing the lowest projected deficit in five years, it\u2019s still a shortfall \u2014 $129 million at last count. Lee has directed department heads to pare their budgets by 1.5 percent for the next fiscal year and another 1.5 percent for the following year.\n\nAnd as Supervisor Mark Farrell has pointed out, lest folks think the good times are here again, the city is still facing $4.4 billion in unfunded health care liabilities for workers and retirees that are not addressed in the budget.",

    "text": "No. 5 Texas rallies in second half to upset No. 1 Oklahoma\n\nBy Kelly Whiteside, USA TODAY\n\nDALLAS \u0097 Three years after Texas quarterback Vince Young lifted the crystal football national championship trophy, the Longhorns are making another run at the national title, but this time with a diverse group of leaders on offense instead of a front and center star.\n\nIn 2005, Young nearly single-handedly carried the Longhorns, especially with his memorable performance in the national title game against Southern California. Young was the face of that team. This year's group?\n\n\"Right know this team would be known for heart and character and toughness and playing together as a team,\" said coach Mack Brown after No. 5 Texas' 45-35 victory over No. 1 Oklahoma on Saturday in the Cotton Bowl. \"There are not individuals, not guys who walk around talk about themselves. Everyone has questioned this team including me. I've sat around and said, 'I don't know how good we are.' And today we played good and played as a team.\"\n\nA team which defeated a No. 1 for the first time since that Rose Bowl win against USC. A team which tied for the most points scored in this rivalry game, 45 also in 2005. A team which had two receivers, Quan Cosby and Jordan Shipley, become the first duo to record more than 100 receiving yards each in a Red River Rivalry game. A team which held its opponent to under 50 yards rushing for the fifth time in its six games this season.\n\nSaturday's standouts on offense all made comebacks of sorts throughout their careers.\n\nJunior Heisman Trophy contending quarterback Colt McCoy's comeback continues after his sophomore slide. He was 28-of-35 for 277 yards with one touchdown and no turnovers. Facing plenty of blitzes \u2014 he was sacked four times \u2013 but also scrambled 14 times for 31 yards and repeatedly improvised to find his two favorite receivers open often in the middle of the field.\n\n\"You can always count on Quan and Jordan to get open if I have time in the pocket,\" McCoy said. \" And that's where it starts, with the offensive line. With Quan and Jordan I have the ability to change any route against them no matter who they're matched up against, our communication is so strong. We've been together for so long and I can count on them to get open all the time.\"\n\nShipley caught 11 passes, a record for most receptions in this rivalry, for 112 yards and a touchdown, and set up the final go-ahead score with a 37-yard catch that ended inside the 1-yard line. He also had a 96-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the first half.\n\nAfter a career derailed by injuries in 2004 and 2005, it's no wonder Shipley, a friend of McCoy's since childhood, was among the last to leave the field after the band played the \"Eyes of Texas.\" \"It's an unbelievable feeling,\" he said.\n\nCosby caught nine passes for 122 yards and held on to a 2-point conversion which popped out of his arms at first. The win was especially sweet for Cosby, given his detour after originally signing with Texas in 2001. Cosby spent four years playing minor league baseball and the 25-year-old is a married father of two.\n\nRunning back Chris Ogbonnaya, a senior making his second career start, was a role player until this season. On Saturday, he ran 15 times for a career high 127 yards, including a 62-yarder that set up the game-securing score, answering the Longhorns' call for a reliable runner. \"Chris is a stud. We've known that all along,\" McCoy said.\n\nFour times in the last eight years \u2014 Oklahoma in 2000, 2003 and 2004 and Texas in 2005 \u2014 the winner of this game ultimately landed in the national championship game. For the 2008 Longhorns (6-0, 2-0 Big 12) to add their names to that list, they will have to survive a treacherous three game stretch beginning next Saturday at home against No. 2 Missouri, followed by No. 17 Oklahoma State and then a Nov. 1 trip to No. 7 Texas Tech.\n\nWhile it wasn't a dominating victory as some might have wished for, the Longhorns (6-0, 2-0 Big 12) showed the ability to come from behind, erasing Oklahoma (5-1, 1-1) leads of 28-20 and 35-30 in the second half.\n\nAfter the win, Texas players were already talking about the Missouri game. \"We won this game two years ago and had a chance to win the Big 12 conference and then lost the last two games,\" Brown said. \"So we have learned our lesson. \u2026 We have to understand what it is, it's a fun game, it's a really exciting game and really important to your league and your fans but if you let this one be bigger than next week's then all of a sudden you've got nothing.\"\n\nBrown doesn't feel his team should be ranked No. 1 when the polls come on out Sunday. \"Because people ahead of us, if they continue to win should be ahead of us,\" he said. \"We should be a top five team this week. \u2026.

In one example, the rent for a two bedroom apartment shot up from under $800 to almost $1,300.\n\n\"This economy is hard enough without facing rents being raised by $500 - who could afford that?\" said tenant leader Cora Bennett, one of half a dozen tenants being sued for eviction.\n\nRiverview counters that because the company was formed under Article 5 of the state's Private Housing Finance Law, the building does not fall under DHCR's jurisdiction, but rather the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, thus exempting it from state rent regulations.\n\nUJC lawyer Garrett Wright contends, however, that unless HPD actually maintains the regulation of the units' rents, state rent-stabilization laws would kick in.\n\nLast week, the state Court of Appeals upheld a ruling against another developer, Tishman Speyer, holding that the company cannot deregulate apartments at Manhattan's Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town because of the tax breaks they collect from the city.\n\nThe attorneys for the Sedgwick tenants believe this precedent will strengthen their case, since Riverview receives the same type of tax breaks.\n\nAt issue is more than just the jacked-up rents, according to Wright.\n\n\"Rent-stabilization law goes beyond the issue of rent, and includes a host of eviction protections for tenants,\" said Wright.",

    "text": "House members are scattering to their home states this week with inconclusive results on the humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of western Sudan, but momentum is growing at the state level for governments to divest public funds from companies, mostly foreign-based, doing business with Khartoum.\n\nIn a victory for business lobbyists on Capitol Hill, lawmakers approved a Sudan sanctions bill stripped of language that would have endorsed states' rights to pass divestment laws. The National Foreign Trade Council, representing more than 300 multinational companies, had lobbied aggressively against the provision on state investments inserted by the House during its consideration of the bill last year.\n\nA divestment movement, however, appears to be gaining momentum across the country, with active campaigns on university campuses and at city and state levels. Six states have already passed divestment laws: Maine, Connecticut, Oregon, Illinois, New Jersey and California.\n\nAlthough state legislatures will not be in session until January, lawmakers in many states are pushing for divestment bills, according to Adam Sterling, the executive director of the Sudan Divestment Task Force, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the issue.\n\nColorado, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington could consider some form of legislation early next year, according to the task force's Web site, which is tracking the initiatives and keeping a list of companies that warrant scrutiny.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's much-publicized signing of his state's divestment law -- standing alongside actor-activists Don Cheadle and George Clooney -- has helped spread popular awareness on the continuing violence in Darfur and given added momentum to the divestment drive, Sterling said.\n\nThe violence in Darfur began three years ago, when the Sudanese government, backed by a state-sponsored Arab militia called the Janjaweed, moved to crush African rebel movements in the fertile agricultural territory that has long resisted central government control of its resources. The conflict has left as many as 450,000 people dead and driven more than 2 million people from their homes.\n\nSudan has refused to allow a U.N. peacekeeping force into Darfur, and on Monday said it opposed an indefinite extension of an African Union peace mission there.\n\n\"At this point, we are approaching that critical mass where it is past symbolism,\" Sterling said. \"We are already seeing a response from the Sudanese government. Last April, a press release from the Sudanese Embassy here urged institutions to stop divesting, and in a recent discussion with our campaign leader in Indiana, Beth Reilly, that was the only topic the Sudanese ambassador was interested in addressing.\"\n\nThe National Foreign Trade Council has argued that unilateral American sanctions will not alter the behavior of a government if other countries continue to do business with it. U.S. companies have been prohibited from conducting business in Sudan since 1997, when terrorism-related sanctions were imposed on the country, but some are exempt.\n\nThe Darfur Peace and Accountability Act (HR 3127), which passed last month with bipartisan support, urges President Bush to prohibit Sudanese oil tankers from entering U.S. ports and bans cargo ships that deliver goods to Sudan's armed forces. The bill also would deny visas to individuals implicated in the killing in Darfur.\n\n\"The bill is not bad, it is just incomplete,\" Rep. Michael E. Capuano (D-Mass.) said in a telephone interview from Boston last Tuesday. \"I don't think that divestment will have the impact of shutting down the economy of the Sudan, but if it is just a penny it is worth doing -- you do what you think is right and you hope that it works.\"\n\n\"This issue can't wait any longer,\" Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) warned this week, vowing to push for an amendment he co-sponsored with Rep. Barbara T. Lee (D-Calif.) to restore the divestment language. \"These are people who respond only to pressure, and one of our efforts is to push the Europeans who share our position on this to do more. It is unfathomable that . . . before our very eyes yet another genocide should unfold, specifically in Darfur. The Rwanda episode is still very much on people's minds.\"\n\nThe amendment calls for a halt to federal contracts going to international companies whose business in Sudan may directly or indirectly support the Sudanese government's military campaign in Darfur. Lee said similar measures against South Africa helped end apartheid.\n\nWhile the sanctions campaign to end apartheid in South Africa took more than 20 years to show any effect, the Sudan divestment movement is only 18 months old. The effort grew out of an eight-month study group at UCLA and has quickly developed into a nationwide network.\n\nLee, who sits on the House International Relations Committee and serves on the Africa subcommittee, has been a leading voice in the divestment movement.\n\n\"So many people have died, we have to use every tool at our disposal,\" she said. \"It is our duty to make sure pension funds don't have blood in their banks. It is the blood of genocide. We don't know how many companies are involved. We know there are $600 million in federal contracts, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. We have got to step up and do something.\"\n\nThere are no American companies that are directly involved, but at least two dozen multinational companies, mostly in the energy sector, have been targeted by divestment campaigners. Already, 3M and Xerox have restricted all operations in Sudan to humanitarian work, according to Sterling, and Royal Dutch Shell is engaging with human rights groups so as not to be perceived as complicit in atrocities.",

    "text": "TUNE IN: ABC News and Yahoo! News will host a first-ever live global broadcast today to commemorate the 50th anniversary the March on Washington. This hybrid digital-television event will be anchored by GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS along with DAN KLOEFFLER from ABC News World Headquarters in New York beginning at 11:00 a.m., ET. When President Obama speaks from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, ABC News will simulcast a live special report to the ABC Television Network and to the Yahoo!-ABC News Network. http://abcn.ws/16OtUdG\n\nTHE TEAM: ABC News will have a team of correspondents, anchors, and guests contributing to its anniversary coverage throughout the day: COKIE ROBERTS and renowned Harvard Law Professor Charles Ogletree will provide insights and historical context from ABC News Headquarters in New York. Ogletree is the founder of Harvard\u2019s Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice. Chief National Correspondent and Anchor BYRON PITTS will lead the network\u2019s coverage from the Lincoln Memorial. LINSEY DAVIS will join him there. Senior Justice Correspondent PIERRE THOMAS will report from Washington. Senior National Correspondent JIM AVILA will report from the White House. ABC News Radio Correspondent VIC RATNER, who covered the March on Washington in 1963, will tell viewers what it was like to report on the historical event 50 years ago.\n\nMARCH ON WASHINGTON \u2014 50 YEARS LATER\n\nVOTING RIGHTS FIX TESTS CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT\u2019S STRENGTH. The same Voting Rights Act that grew partially from the March on Washington 50 years ago into one of the most successful civil rights-era laws has become a source of rancor, even straining the traditional coalition of Republicans and Democrats who have come together in favor of such vigilance, ABC\u2019s ABBY PHILLIP writes. Marking half a century since the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. King gave voice to the aspirations of millions of African-Americans across the country is bittersweet for civil rights activists in 2013. \u201cWithin the civil rights movement, there is definitely a sense that there\u2019s a continued war on voting and we haven\u2019t made it to the mountain top yet,\u201d said Katherine Culliton-Gonz\u00e1lez, director of Voter Protection for the Advancement project. \u201cHere we are in 2013, at the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, and we\u2019re having to try to stop going backwards.\u201d Blacks have never been closer than now to achieving King\u2019s dream, but there is also more political division than in decades about whether changes to voting rights laws in jurisdictions across the country constitute an affront to civil rights. Combating election law changes they believe are discriminatory is at the top of the agenda of civil rights activists, but many of Republicans and Democrats who have historically come together to support continued federal vigilance over potentially discriminatory laws are divided.

Vice President Joe Biden yesterday said there\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d that Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime is responsible for the recent chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians, as the Obama administration weighs its response, ABC\u2019s MARY BRUCE reports. \u201cThere is no doubt that an essential international norm has been violated \u2014 violated. Chemical weapons have been used,\u201d the vice president told the American Legion National Convention in Houston. \u201cAnd there is no doubt who is responsible for this heinous use of chemical weapons in Syria: the Syrian regime.\u201d \u201cFor we know that the Syrian regime are the only ones who have the weapons \u2014 have used chemical weapons multiple times in the past, have the means of delivering those weapons, have been determined to wipe out exactly the places that were attacked by chemical weapons,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd instead of allowing U.N. inspectors immediate access, the government has repeatedly shelled the sites of the attack and blocked the investigation for five days.\u201d http://abcn.ws/12IBNjT\n\nADMINISTRATION DRUMS UP CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR SYRIAN STRIKE. While President Obama considers options for responding to what they say was a chemical weapons attack in Syria, several senior administration officials are conducting a full-court press to drum up support for a military response, ABC\u2019s JOHN PARKINSON and ARLETTE SAENZ report. They are consulting with key members of Congress to keep them apprised on strings of intelligence as they are being developed and the possibilities that await the president\u2019s approval. Beyond the outreach from senior administration officials, ABC News has learned that in recent days Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has personally spoken with President Obama, his 2008 presidential campaign rival, to discuss America\u2019s response, according to an aide to McCain. McCain, who also connected with National Security Advisor Susan Rice, questioned whether an air strike would be effective and offered suggestions for additional actions the administration could take against the Syrian government. \u201cWill those attacks just be a retaliation and [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad] basically goes on as normal?\u201d McCain asked during an appearance on Fox News yesterday. \u201dOr will those attacks degrade his capabilities, particularly his air capabilities, which you could do easily with standoff weaponry and start getting weapons that people need, Gen. Idris and his people need, in order to reverse the momentum on the battlefield.\n\n\u2013LAWMAKERS CONSULTED. Secretary of State John Kerry has also placed a number of calls to top members of committees with jurisdiction in the matter, including House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., and Ranking Democrat Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. A spokesman for Royce said that the chairman \u201cdiscussed the situation in Syria\u201d with Kerry late Monday, but did not divulge details of the conversation. Kerry also connected with Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez, D-N.J., as did U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, while the ranking Republican on the committee, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., spoke to \u201cadministration officials\u201d numerous times throughout the past several days, according to an aide. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was briefed by the administration. And, \u201csenior\u201d Defense Department officials have reached out to House Armed Services Chairman Buck McKeon, R-Calif., and ranking Democrat Adam Smith of Washington state to discuss the crisis, according to committee aides. A congressional source said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., \u201cwas personally briefed by National Security Advisor Susan Rice late yesterday [Monday].\u201d Tony Blinken, the Deputy National Security Advisor, also briefed House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the lower chamber, as well as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va.\n\n\u2013MAKING THE CASE FOR CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION. Rep. Justin Amash, demanded that the president first acquire congressional authorization before going forward with any sort of military strike. Amash, a second-term Republican from Michigan, asked Boehner to call the House of Representatives back into session for a debate and vote on authorization, and asserted that a strike authorized by the president without congressional authorization is \u201cunquestionably unconstitutional\u201d and \u201cillegal,\u201d citing the War Powers Act. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., agreed \u2013 pointing to Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, which gives Congress \u2013 not the President \u2013 the power to declare war. Despite U.S. military action in more than a dozen theaters of conflict over the past 70 years, the United States has not formally declared war on any country since World War II, when it declared war on Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania on June 5, 1942. Congress last authorized U.S. military combat for Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, although the president has authorized military action against countries such as Libya as recently as 2011.\n\nOUTGOING DHS SECRETARY JANET NAPOLITANO WARNS OF \u2018SERIOUS\u2019 CYBER ATTACK. The outgoing Homeland Security Secretary has a warning for her successor: A massive and \u201cserious\u201d cyber attack on the U.S. homeland is coming, and a natural disaster \u2014 the likes of which the nation has never seen \u2014 is also likely on its way, according to ABC\u2019s MIKE LEVINE. So prepare, and bring \u201ca large bottle of Advil,\u201d Janet Napolitano told her yet-to-be-named replacement in a farewell address yesterday. \u201cMany things still need tending, and my successor will most certainly have a full plate on his or her hands,\u201d said Napolitano, who leaves her post next week after more than four years at the helm of the Department of Homeland Security. Napolitano said she faced \u201cmany challenges\u201d during her tenure at DHS, from the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. DHS \u2014 backed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Coast Guard and other federal departments and agencies \u2014 led the federal government\u2019s response to such disasters. During Napolitano\u2019s tenure, her department managed 325 federally declared disasters, and issued more than 60 emergency declarations, she said at the National Press Club in Washington. http://abcn.ws/12HX8Kq\n\nTHE COMPLICATED LEGAL BACKSTORY OF TERRY MCAULIFFE\u2019S FORMER CAR COMPANY. For an upstart electric-car company with big ambitions, its ties to Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe have been both a blessing and a curse, ABC\u2019s CHRIS GOOD reports. The company, GreenTech, is now front and center in Virginia\u2019s 2013 race for governor, and its critics are raising questions about political favoritism, national-security risks, and the government\u2019s role in foreign investments\u2014unwelcome attention for the struggling firm. McAuliffe defended his role in the company in a recent op-ed. But troubles began for two GreenTech executives before McAuliffe became its chairman and well before he launched his Democratic bid for governor. In 2009, months before McAuliffe bought 25 percent of GreenTech and became chairman, two top executives were embroiled in a lawsuit that was covered in local press and detailed in a federal judge\u2019s advisory opinion. Not only was the future CEO of GreenTech, Xiaolin \u201cCharles\u201d Wang, embroiled in a dispute with a business partner not long before McAuliffe got involved, a federal judge said Wang took actions of \u201cdubious legality\u201d in issuing stock in connection with a similar company, Hybrid Kinetic Automotive Corp. While all of that long predated McAuliffe\u2019s involvement in GreenTech, and while he left GreenTech as chairman last year, the man who is now hoping to be governor of Virginia has acknowledged joining the executives\u2019 new venture despite knowing about some of the past legal troubles. BACKSTORY: http://abcn.ws/12KlVNS\n\nON VIDEO PRESIDENT FORD RECOUNTS ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT. A cult member scheming to assassinate the President of the United States may sound like the plot for a fictional thriller, but it\u2019s actually a rediscovered page out of American history books made available to the public for the first time, ABC\u2019s ALISA WIERSEMA notes. Footage of President Ford\u2019s testimony against his failed assassin, Lynette \u201cSqueaky\u201d Fromme, was released Monday after being sealed for nearly 38 years \u2014 thanks to a motion filed by the Eastern District Historical Society, a group in Sacramento, Calif. The testimony marked the first time in history that a sitting American president was called to testify in a criminal trial. Throughout the nearly 20-minute-long testimony, Ford calmly gestures and sips water as he responds to questions about the events leading up to the shocking incident. Ford said he noticed a person in a \u201cbrightly colored dress\u201d among a crowd of bystanders on his way to the state Capitol in Sacramento. He also noted that the person, who would later be identified as Fromme, \u201cappeared to want to either shake hands or speak, or at least wanted to get closer\u201d to him. When the woman moved toward him, Ford stated that he assumed she wanted to shake hands, but quickly realized his error. \u201cAs I stopped, I saw a hand come through the crowd [and] in the hand was a weapon,\u201d Ford said. http://abcn.ws/16OztZB\n\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\n\nABC\u2019S DAVID FORD JOINS FUSION.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nDigg confirmed Thursday it sold its brand, website and technology to Betaworks. The price is a pittance for a company that raised $45 million from prominent investors including Facebook investor Greylock Partners, LinkedIn Inc. founder Reid Hoffman, and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.\n\nDigg received higher offers from bidders that included technology and publishing companies and start-ups but ultimately decided Betaworks had the best plan for reviving its brand, these people said. In May, Washington Post Co. hired 15 members of Digg's engineering team\u2014more than half of the company's overall staff\u2014for its SocialCode digital media subsidiary.\n\nBetaworks is acquiring a website that still has a well known brand and sizable audience of more than 7 million visitors per month as of May, according to comScore.\n\nDigg founder Kevin Rose landed on the cover of BusinessWeek in 2006.\n\nDigg was once one of the most promising start-ups in Silicon Valley. The website was founded in 2004 as a way for consumers to put together their own collections of news and other Internet content, rather than relying on the choices made by newspaper editors.\n\nDigg users would post links on the site's home page, then others would vote on their choices, determining the prominence of the stories they posted.\n\n\"They were one of the first social media sites,\" says Kristina Lerman, an assistant research professor at the University of Southern California who has studied Digg and other social-news sharing sites. \"They introduced social components like having friends and followers.\"\n\nThe site quickly rose to prominence, in part due to telegenic founder Kevin Rose, a former cable television talk show host. In 2006, Mr. Rose landed on the cover of BusinessWeek with the now infamous cover line, \"How This Kid Made $60 Million in 18 Months,\" referring to the company's valuation at the time.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, Digg raised nearly $29 million in venture capital from Greylock Partners, Highland Capital Partners and other financiers in an investment valuing the company at around $164 million, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.\n\nOver the years, the company was rumored to be in negotiations to sell itself several times, including to Google Inc. in 2008 for a reported $200 million. The deal was never completed.\n\nFor early employees with equity stakes in the company like Owen Byrne, the site's first lead engineer, the failure to sell the company was a huge disappointment. Mr. Byrne, who left the company in 2007, said in an interview he never got to \"cash out and go live on the Riviera.\"\n\nBut the audience started to drift away in early 2010 when services such as Facebook and Twitter exploded in popularity, as users preferred getting article recommendations from their friends or people they followed.\n\nA series of redesigns, some of which weren't well-received by users, also hurt the company. A site relaunch in the summer of 2010 triggered a backlash, with most users saying they preferred the old Digg. By the end of 2010, Digg's audience had fallen by more than half, according to ComScore.\n\nNewer social-news website Reddit Inc. also stole some of Digg's thunder. Last December, Reddit drew more visitors than Digg for the first time, according to comScore, and since then it has maintained that lead.\n\nIn March of last year, Mr. Rose, the founder, resigned from the company. He is now a venture capitalist with Google Ventures.\n\nBetaworks intends to fold Digg into News.me Inc., a digital media start-up that Betaworks launched in April 2011. News.me sends users links to news articles that their connections on Twitter and Facebook are reading and talking about. News.me, which uses an iPad and iPhone app and daily email newsletter, has about 10 employees.\n\nDigg shareholders also received a very small amount of warrants in the combined Digg and News.me company worth a few percent of the new entity, said a person familiar with the matter. Digg investors are not receiving any equity in Betaworks, said the person.\n\nThe new combined company is very young and unproven and hard to value, but internally Betaworks values it around $5 million to $10 million, making the warrants worth a few hundred thousand dollars on paper.\n\nNone of Digg's remaining employees will join Betaworks as part of the acquisition. Chief Executive Matt Williams will join venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as an entrepreneur-in-residence.\n\nBetaworks CEO John Borthwick will become Digg's new chief.\n\nWrite to Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@dowjones.com and Spencer E. Ante at spencer.ante@wsj.com\n\nA version of this article appeared July 13, 2012, on page B3 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Once a Social-Media Star, Digg Sells for $500,000.",

    "text": "While celebrity sightings at Fashion Week are more commonplace than stilettos and attitudes, one A-lister is standing out while sitting front-row.\n\nThe pop star blitzed the biannual event with her own unique brand of style.\n\n\u201cRihanna is one of the few celebrities that blazes her own fashion trail,\u201d says Micky Boardman, Paper Magazine and Fashion Week veteran. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s styled, even though she has a great stylist: Mel Ottenberg.\u201d\n\nThe songstress, who popped up in the Big Apple last Wednesday, has been traipsing through the streets of New York in chest-bearing togs, sitting front-row at some of the hottest fashion shows, and even fueling rumors of a romance with rapper A$AP Rocky \u2014 and looking fabulous doing it.\n\nThe singer\u2019s style is partly due to the creative eye of American stylist Ottenberg, who also doubles as the fashion editor at Purple Magazine. Ottenberg, who works with fashion\u2019s top, often edgy designers and only a few celebrities, told style.com that his styling signature was \u201ca certain effortlessness.\u201d\n\nAnd that ethos shines through.\n\nAt Alexander Wang\u2019s Saturday show, she appeared sultry in a red number with a plunging neckline.\n\nThe next night, she tapped into her inner Goth chick \u2014 and solidified the fact that she\u2019s single-handedly bringing back the choker \u2014 by sporting a vintage-looking Zac Posen dress with chunky brothel creepers.\n\nBetween shows, she kept pace with her killer street style while shopping in Soho and hailing cabs around town.\n\nOften, adds Boardman, \u201cStars seem to just wear the latest looks and don\u2019t have a strong personal fashion identity. Rihanna is the real deal.\n\nHere are five reasons why Rihanna rocks it:\n\nWho would put on a dog-chain choker with a T-shirt, jeans and an oversize clutch? She does. And she looks fabulous.\n\n2. Nobody mixes casual street gear and luxury like the singer.\n\nWith an affinity for cheeky Givenchy T-shirts and high-top Nikes, the Barbadian beauty mixes in less-casual items to take the look from boring to daring.\n\n3. She keeps us guessing.\n\nWhenever Rihanna steps out of the house, she could have a new mullet, red butt-length locks or a new naughty tattoo. Not all of them are winners, but they keep us tuned-in.\n\n4. She doesn\u2019t subscribe to any one designer or aesthetic.\n\nNothing is too cheap or too expensive for her taste. One day, she\u2019s wearing elegant Zac Posen and Manolos, and the next, a marijuana-leaf-emblazoned clutch and a camo onesie from her collection with River Island.\n\n5. Her best accessory is her attitude.\n\nAlways looking like she\u2019s having fun, Rihanna could go naked and still make a style statement. Not like she hasn\u2019t before.",

    "text": "David W. Dunlap is a Metro reporter and writes the Building Blocks column. He has worked at The Times for 40 years.\n\nOn Wednesday, the masthead at the top of the editorial page received a considerable haircut. It was stripped of all names but those of The Times\u2019s current and past publishers, going back to Adolph S. Ochs, who purchased the newspaper in 1896.\n\nIt took Mr. Ochs 11 years to place his name and that of his cousin Ben C. Franck on the masthead. They first appeared, in fine type, on June 21, 1907:\n\n\u201cAdolph S. Ochs, Pres\u2019t & Tr. / B. C. Franck, Secy.\u201d\n\nFor the next 56 years, the names of the publishers and their business executives \u2014 but not those of news executives \u2014 appeared in the masthead.\n\nOn Sept. 19, 1963, the young Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who had become publisher only three months earlier, announced a significant change in the masthead. It would henceforth bear the names of chief news executives.\n\n\u201cFor the first time the names of the three principal editors will now appear,\u201d Mr. Sulzberger said, \u201cso that our readers can know the men directly in charge of planning and editing our paper.\u201d\n\nAnd they were men at the time: Turner Catledge, who was managing editor (the equivalent of today\u2019s executive editor); Lester Markel, Sunday editor (a position that no longer exists); and John B. Oakes, editorial page editor. Five business executives were also given pride of place.\n\nSurviving any number of redesigns since then, the basic format was maintained through Tuesday\u2019s paper, when the masthead at the top left corner of the page listed the publisher and chairman; his predecessors; 13 news executives, including Kinsey Wilson, the editor for innovation and strategy; 13 business executives, also including Kinsey Wilson, the executive vice president for product and technology; and three editorial page executives.\n\nThen, on Wednesday, the whole cast of characters, except the publishers, was ushered to the lower right corner of the page.\n\nTimes Kremlinologists could have a field day with this break in a very long tradition. As it happens, though, the editorial page, like every other section, has been experimenting with the ways it presents itself digitally and in print. A single illustration can meaningfully accompany an editorial, both online and in the paper. But a single illustration for letters to the editor, which appear in print as a cohesive whole, may not work as well online, where letters are presented individually.\n\nThe digital solution is to illustrate editorials rather than letters. In print, however, taking illustrations from the letters column and adding them to the editorial well, which is already topped by a large masthead, creates a sense of imbalance. The solution arrived at by all involved was to move most of the contents of the masthead from the editorial side of the page to the letters side.\n\nKremlinologists, please note: no names or titles were changed in the transition.",

It\u2019s estimated that 500 million vacation days a year are lost by US employees who let them lapse.\n\nThe study, by Expedia, found that US workers are offered an average of 15 vacation days a year but take only 11. That\u2019s a stark contrast to European attitudes toward time off. Most of the European labor force is offered 30 vacation days a year, and workers in Finland, France, Germany, and Spain take every day available. The median number of vacation days in the United Arab Emirates and Brazil is also 30, and workers in those countries also take all 30.\n\nWhen asked about leaving vacation time on the table, participants in the study cited busy work schedules, money concerns, or a perception that taking every vacation day offered would be viewed negatively by the boss.\n\nMany respondents also reported that they are still checking e-mail and voice mail and responding to text messages when they are not on the clock.\n\nThe study, now in its 15th year, found that Americans prioritize pay (71 percent) over time off (29 percent). And even though most US workers don\u2019t use all of their vacation days, they would go through some bizarre sacrifices to get more.\n\nIn exchange for one extra day of vacation each year, 49 percent of Americans would give up alcohol for a week, 47 percent would avoid social media for a week, 40 percent would give up coffee, 26 percent would abstain from sex, and 19 percent would give up the Internet entirely.\n\nAnd 11 percent of those surveyed said they would give up showering for a week.",

    "text": "Shimon Peres, one of Israel\u2019s defining political figures and a Nobel peace prize laureate, has died at the age of 93, two weeks after suffering a stroke.\n\nPeres had twice served as prime minister of Israel and later as the country\u2019s ninth president. He had been seriously ill on a respirator in an Israeli hospital near Tel Aviv and died after his condition deteriorated sharply.\n\nAmong those who have said they will attend his funeral and burial on Jerusalem\u2019s Mount Herzl on Friday are Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, as well as Prince Charles and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\nIn more than six decades of political life his defining achievement was as one of the key architects of the Oslo peace accords, for which he was jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1994 with the then Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.\n\nThose peace agreements \u2013 signed in Washington in 1993 and Taba, Egypt in 1995, \u2013 foresaw the creation of a Palestinian state, and were named after the Norwegian capital where the two sides launched eight months of secret negotiations in which Peres played a key role.\n\nWith Peres\u2019s death the last of that trio has now gone.\n\nRabin was cut down by a rightwing assassin\u2019s bullet in 1995, with Arafat dying nine years later. Today, the prospect of the peace and two-state solution offered by Oslo is far away, after the collapse of that peace process in 2014.\n\nPeres\u2019s death was formally confirmed on Wednesday morning by his son Chemi in a news conference at the hospital where his father had been treated. He had been rushed to hospital on 13 September after suffering a stroke.\n\n\u201cToday with deep sorrow we bid farewell to our beloved father, the ninth president of Israel,\u201d said Peres\u2019s son. \u201cOur father\u2019s legacy has always been to look to tomorrow. We were privileged to be part of his private family, but today we sense that the entire nation of Israel and the global community share this great loss. We share this pain together.\u201d\n\nWithin hours of his death, tributes to Peres began from world leaders. In a statement, Obama described him as \u201cthe essence of Israel itself\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs Americans, we are in his debt because, having worked with every US president since John F Kennedy, no one did more over so many years as Shimon Peres to build the alliance between our two countries \u2013 an unbreakable alliance that today is closer and stronger than it has ever been.\u201d\n\nThe UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said: \u201cHe worked tirelessly for a two-state solution that would enable Israel to live securely and harmoniously with the Palestinians and the wider region.\n\nEven in the most difficult hours, he remained an optimist about the prospects for reconciliation and peace.\u201d\n\nThe Clintons said they had \u201clost a true and treasured friend\u201d and that Israel had lost a leader \u201cwho championed its security, prosperity and limitless possibilities from its birth to his last day on Earth\u201d.\n\nThey called him \u201ca genius with a big heart who used his gifts to imagine a future of reconciliation, not conflict\u201d.\n\nThe Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, called Peres a partner in reaching a \u201cpeace of the brave\u201d and said hes \u201cexerted persistent efforts to reach a just peace from the Oslo agreement until the final moments of his life.\u201d\n\nFriends and confidantes of Peres on Wednesday offered a mixed view of his legacy, not least regarding the Israel-Palestine peace process with which he was so closely associated.\n\nDescribing a tireless friend, his neighbour and biographer Michael Bar Zohar suggested that despite being one of its strongest proponents, Peres also recognised the failure of Oslo.\n\n\u201cThe Oslo agreement was not a very big success, not its conception, not its writing, not its partner,\u201d said Bar Zohar. \u201cIt was one of things he regretted most, but he still stuck to the conviction that Oslo was a great thing and that the \u2018new Middle East\u2019 was a new reality despite what was happening around us.\n\n\u201cHe still felt the two-state solution could be implemented although he was critical of the Israeli government about the stalemate in those negotiations and partly the Palestinians as well.\u201d\n\nThe leader of Israel\u2019s opposition, Isaac Herzog, who had known Peres since childhood first through his father, Chaim Herzog, himself a president of Israel, described a man who lived his life largely in public.\n\n\u201cI was a close confidante of Shimon Peres,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cMy father was a colleague of his and I was also an adviser and an assistant to him as well as a member of government with him. For me he was a teacher and mentor.\n\nOn Oslo, he added: \u201cI think Peres vision of a two-state solution is alive and kicking. It has problems. Stumbling blocks. But it is still possible \u2026 I think the tragedy is both people [Palestinians and Israelis] in majorities want to move to a two-state solution. It is not moving because of politics. But his dream will be implemented.\u201d\n\nDespite his role in the Oslo accords, Palestinians and the wider Arab world saw the legacy of Peres differently. Many have portrayed him as a key figure in early settlement construction and pointed to his role in the 1996 Israeli assault on Lebanon, which saw the deaths of 106 civilians when a UN base where they were sheltering was shelled.\n\nFor many Israelis \u2013 even those on the right who opposed his support of the peace process as \u201cnaive\u201d \u2013 Peres will be remembered for a career that intimately tracked the country\u2019s short history.\n\nThe last surviving figure associated with the founding of modern Israel, Peres moved from being a hawk to a peacemaker.\n\nFor a long time he was a deeply divisive figure in Israeli politics, although in later life he became one of the country\u2019s most popular public figures, serving a seven-year term as president from 2007-14.\n\nEven after his presidential term ended, Peres maintained a high profile. He continued to intervene on the country\u2019s political direction and sought to maintain an active schedule, particularly through events related to his Peres Centre for Peace.\n\nAs recently as last year, Peres strongly criticised the direction of the government of Israel\u2019s rightwing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, although he did not name Netanyahu directly.\n\nPeres said he believed the values he and Rabin had inherited from Israel\u2019s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, were in jeopardy as he defended a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\u201cIsrael should implement the two-state solution for her own sake, because if we should lose our majority, and today we are almost equal, we cannot remain a Jewish state or a democratic state. That\u2019s the main issue, and to my regret they [the government] do the opposite.\u201d\n\nBorn in Wiszniewo, Poland, Peres emigrated to British Mandate Palestine in 1934 at the age of 11, was a founder of the Labour-Zionist Youth Movement and a member of the Hagana Jewish military forces before Israel declared independence.\n\nAs a defence official in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Peres was involved in the establishment in Dimona of Israel\u2019s nuclear reactor, the facility also at the centre of Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons programme.\n\nDuring a decades-long career, he occupied almost every significant position in Israeli political life. His first role was as director general of Israel\u2019s ministry of defence in his 20s, as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Ben-Gurion, involved in the secret planning of the Suez offensive with Britain and France in alliance against Gamal Abdel Nasser\u2019s Egypt.\n\nFirst elected to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, in 1959, his cabinet roles included the defence, finance and foreign affairs portfolios before he served two brief periods as prime minister. Although he ran for prime minister five times between 1977 and 1996, he never won a national election outright.\n\nA noted hawk in the 1970s who had deep reservations about territorial compromise with the Palestinians and supported settlement building and the building up of Israel\u2019s military strength, by the 1980s he had begun to move from the centrist political position he occupied towards the peace camp.\n\nPeres had had several health scares this year and was admitted to hospital twice because of heart problems. In the first case, the hospital said he had suffered a \u201cmild cardiac event\u201d and underwent catheterisation to widen an artery. He was rushed to hospital again days later with chest pains and an irregular heartbeat.",

    "text": "While all eyes have focused on Detroit\u2019s record bankruptcy, an economic crisis is deepening in Puerto Rico that many experts say may be far more harmful to the U.S. economy.\n\nPuerto Rico has been mired in economic recession for almost eight years, with public debt skyrocketing to $70 billion and unemployment climbing to 14 percent, higher than that of any U.S. state. The island\u2019s debt load accounts for 93 percent of its GDP.\n\nMany economic experts worry that Puerto Rico could default on its debt, having a potential direct impact on mainland United States.\n\nIn September, Puerto Rico's Government Development Bank announced it would cut bond sales after investors pushed the yield on Puerto Rico bonds above 10 percent. The island's general obligation bonds have been hovering at just above near-junk status. That worries economic experts who note that many Americans\u2019 retirement funds include Puerto Rico bonds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the residents of Puerto Rico\u201d who are affected, said Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, based in Washington D.C. \u201cIt\u2019s Americans across the country who are at risk as well.\u201d\n\nThe situation on the island is so critical that residents are fleeing in the largest numbers in decades, ushering a quiet exodus. Tens of thousands have left for mainland U.S. between 2010 and 2012, according to The Washington Post.\n\nCompanies also are eyeing the exits.\n\nPfizer announced recently that it was closing one of its three plants in Puerto Rico, leaving an unknown number of people unemployed. The move came just days after Merck announced it would stop active ingredient production at its plant in Barceloneta, a Puerto Rican city that was once considered a pharmaceutical hub.\n\nWhile the Obama administration and Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla say a U.S. bailout is not in the offing, the U.S. government nonetheless is concerned enough about the island\u2019s tattered finances to put together an advisory team that is spending part of December there to help Puerto Rico manage the economic crisis.\n\n\u201cNot only is there a debt problem, but there\u2019s a deep [economic] structural problem,\u201d said Juan Carlos Hidalgo, a Latin America policy analyst at the Cato Institute. \u201cPuerto Rico has one of the lowest labor participation rates in the world. Only about 40 percent of the working age population is in the labor force.\u201d\n\nAnd of those in the labor force, a third, Hidalgo said, work in the public sector.\n\n\u201cSo you have a very tiny percentage of the population actually sustaining the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond that, Hidalgo said, there's a heavy welfare dependency in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe island also is bound by U.S.-mainland minimum wage laws, which Hidalgo argued are not suitable to Puerto Rico\u2019s labor and economic factors and have led to high unemployment among its youth and low-skilled workers.\n\n\u201cEmployers are not going to hire very young or unskilled workers for minimum wage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe joblessness, Hidalgo noted, has fueled a high crime rate, and re-energized the illegal drug business. And the exodus of Puerto Ricans, many of them of working age and high-skilled, has meant a glut of abandoned homes on the island where mortgages are going into default, he said.\n\nFormer Gov. Luis Fortuno, a Republican, tried to address the economic problems and the bloated government workforce. He slashed nearly 40,000 government jobs, which shrank the public workforce by about 20 percent.\n\nFortuno also cut personal income and corporate taxes, and made a host of other economic changes. His dramatic moves helped lower the deficit to $660 million from $3.3 billion.\n\nBut while the island saw some aspects of its economy improve, major problems remained, and some even grew worse. The welfare rolls, for instance, swelled in large part because of all the government workers who suddenly were unemployed.\n\nFormer Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock places much of the blame for the island\u2019s financial mess on former Gov. An\u00edbal Acevedo Vil\u00e1.\n\n\u201cHe put in place a number of user fees, he increased everything by such large sums that it produced our first non-mainland-triggered recession,\u201d said McClintock. \u201cWe began a recession at a time when the rest of the United States was not in a recession. He refused to make major spending cuts and, as a result, we accumulated all these deficits.\u201d\n\nWhen he and Fortuno were sworn into office in 2009, McClintock said, \u201cWe found a $4.4 billion deficit. It got to the point where we did not even have the cash for the first payroll that January.\u201d\n\nThe decision to lay off a huge part of the public sector, he said, was a tough one.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we lost the election,\u201d he said.\n\nHidalgo added: \u201cGov. Fortuno did not get enough time to finish his work.\u201d\n\nGarcia Padilla did not maintain many of the policies that his predecessor put in place, McClintock said.\n\nSome of Fortuno\u2019s critics say that while he did make many necessary cuts, he failed to take longer-term steps, such as laying out a plan for job creation.\n\nBesides the move to cut bond sales after investors pushed the yield on Puerto Rico bonds above 10 percent, Garcia Padilla said he would increase the borrowing capacity of Puerto Rico's main debt issuer, the Sales Tax Financing Authority.\n\nGarcia Padilla also has taken other measures to appease Wall Street ratings agencies, including the reformation of a public pension system that had a $37.3 billion unfunded liability.\n\nPuerto Rico, a commonwealth, is ineligible to file for bankruptcy.\n\nEnter the U.S. advisory team that is spending part of December on the island.\n\nThe team will be composed of officials from the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency. The team is expected to work with the U.S. territory's government on how best to maximize federal funds in those areas to help boost its economy.\n\nThe officials will work in an advisory capacity, making sure federal money available to Puerto Rico is being taken advantage of and is being appropriately administered.\n\nNo additional federal funds are planned beyond current allocations.\n\nFormer Puerto Rico House Speaker Jenniffer (CQ) Gonzalez said she considers the move as a type of receivership.\n\n\"It shows the lack of trust that the federal government has concerning the capacity of the current administration over economic and fiscal matters,\" said Gonzalez, a representative affiliated with the pro-statehood New Progressive Party.\n\nWhile Garcia Padilla did not respond to requests for comment regarding the U.S. team visit, his chief of staff Ingrid Vila rejected Gonzalez's comments.\n\n\"There is no federal takeover of Puerto Rico,\" she said. \"Our economic plan is working, and we are continuing to work through the next phases of our plan, which includes tapping the Obama Administration for advice on how we can maximize our federal resources, so that we can grow the Commonwealth's economy.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, Garcia Padilla echoed Vila.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that Puerto Rico will not default,\u201d he said. \u201cPuerto Rico will pay our debts. It is a constitutional obligation. But for me it is also a moral obligation.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nElizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.com\n\nFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_Llorente",

    "text": "There is one fundamental question of modern presidential politics: Who are our candidates listening to, and how? Are those people a problem? And how can we get them \u2013 either the politicians, or those to whom they are listening \u2013 to listen to us?\n\nCurrently at the center of our national frustration with our pay-for-play political system is Hillary Clinton, because Republican activist Peter Schweizer\u2019s \u2013 a man with a strong record of partisan political investigations that can be easily debunked \u2013 new book Clinton Cash \u201cexposes\u201d a number of coincidental decisions he\u2019d like people to believe that Hillary Clinton made as Secretary of State. While her husband Bill collected fees for speaking appearances before various groups, Schweizer \u201creports\u201d that decisions made within the State Department may have had direct and indirect effects on their financial interests.\n\nThe most eye-catching coincidence involves a deal to sell a Canadian mining company, Uranium One, to the Russian atomic energy agency Rosatom. This deal ultimately gave Rosatom control of one-fifth of uranium production capacity in the US. However, since uranium is classified as a strategic asset \u2013 for all the mushroom cloud reasons you can imagine \u2013 the sale had to be approved by multiple US agencies, including the State Department.\n\nDuring this transaction, which evolved slowly from 2009-2013, the Clinton Foundation accepted four different donations from the owner and chairman of Uranium One, totalling $2.35m. And Bill Clinton personally accepted $500,000 from a Russian investment bank touting the Uranium One stock and connected to the Russian government for a speech in Moscow.\n\nNow, there are many reasons to discount Schweizer\u2019s allegations. For one thing, the State Department was one of nine agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States that had to approve the Rosatom deal, and State didn\u2019t chair it (Clinton, like her predecessors, delegated responsibility for the CFIUS meetings to the Assistant Secretary of State for Economic, Energy and Business Affairs). The owner of Uranium One who gave the Clinton Foundation money wasn\u2019t still the owner by the time Clinton became Secretary of State; the chairman said that he committed his money before she took the job or the deal was in the offing.\n\nAnd, in 2010, giving a renegade Putin control of one-fifth of America\u2019s spooky boom-boom metal didn\u2019t seem sinister; it\u2019s only in hindsight that it does seem nefarious, after Putin\u2019s annexation of the Crimea. At the time, outside of the neocon groups huddling in John Bolton\u2019s \u201cwe\u2019re all gonna die!\u201d anxiety closet, it was considered a good idea to increase cooperation and defuse tensions between the US and Russia. Lastly, if we know nothing else about Bill Clinton, it\u2019s that he\u2019d give a 45-minute talk about resource allocation to a hot dog sandwich if there were $250,000 in it.\n\nBut, in the wake of Citizens United and the new operating assumption that money is speech, going into 2016, we ought to ask if Clinton\u2019s position is unique.\n\n\u201cNot A Real Jeb\u201d Bush and his family have extensive ties to the energy industry, Poppy Bush having made his fortune in oil wildcatting. The connections that funded Dubya\u2019s surprisingly personally profitable failed energy companies extent to Jeb as well. And don\u2019t forget the family\u2019s deep ties to the House of Saud,the ruling dynasty of the globe\u2019s leading exporter of 9/11 hijackers and the funders of Isis. Jeb, of course, hasn\u2019t formally declared his candidacy yet, partly to avoid putting caps on the amount these groups can donate to him.\n\nThere\u2019s Ted Cruz, who has declared \u2013 most likely because he can\u2019t rake in as much money as Jeb \u2013 still has his own billionaire, a tax-dodger named Robert Mercer. Scott Walker was long considered the billionaire Koch brothers\u2019 preferred candidate (you may remember him from the time he was prank called by someone imitating David Koch), but Walker may no longer be the brothers\u2019 favorite. Marco Rubio won the straw poll at the Koch brother\u2019s donor summit \u2013 and that\u2019s nothing to sneeze at, considering they\u2019ve stated their willingness to spend up to $889m on political groups, think tanks and endowments through 2016.\n\nRubio, like Cruz, argues that government and regulation are bad because wealthy groups can use \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d to influence other elites, and that, if you can eliminate regulation or reduce the influence of government, wealthy people will no longer be able to use their wealth to influence policy. Immediately after declaring his candidacy, Rubio gave a billionaire sugar baron a big hug.\n\nThere are more candidates to mention, but let\u2019s end with Rand Paul, who also dislikes crony capitalism. He\u2019s backed by Ayn Randroid billionaire Peter Thiel and has spent months courting the billionaire venture capitalists of Silicon Valley. He also used to really hate American funding of Israel, until he met billionaire political donor Sheldon Adelson, who loves Israel and almost singlehandedly kept Newt Gingrich\u2019s laughable 2012 campaign alive.\n\nAll of this access and all of this funding is completely permissible under the law established by Citizens United. At any moment, these donors can drop a few score million into a PAC that will absolutely, positively not coordinate in any way, shape or form with the candidate\u2019s campaign, even if they are run by personal friends or former aides of the candidate. As long as they pinky-swear that they aren\u2019t taking direction from or giving direction to the candidates on whom they\u2019re spending untold millions, it\u2019s all just free speech according to the US supreme court, which stated that raising this kind of money via third-party PACs does \u201cnot give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\u201d\n\nWhither Clinton, then? If these funds and donors are able to aid the campaigns of these candidates, it is an unfair double standard to argue that she or her husband cannot pursue \u201cglobal initiatives\u201d without being tainted? And if the argument is that these ties are problematic because Clinton was in office, why is it acceptable that all those other candidates \u2013 besides Bush \u2013 are cultivating these ties while in office themselves? Condemning Clinton sounds more like sour grapes \u2013 like condemning her achievement.\n\nBesides, if Citizens United has taught us anything, it is that money is equivalent to speech: to borrow from Clauswitz, it is an expression of one\u2019s convictions by other means. And what job does a diplomat have if not to listen to others\u2019 speech? If anything, it appears that critics are castigating Hillary Clinton for doing her job really, really well.\n\nIf there is fault to be found in Clinton or the Clinton Foundation possibly giving a more attentive ear to groups and individuals who have the funds needed to empower initiatives, it is in those of us who have not done enough to advance our own political interests by increasing and then donating to politicians our personal wealth. Why should we punish others, and Clinton, for their successes? Instead of tearing them down, maybe we should focus on building ourselves up so we can more effectively express ourselves, through robust outlays of cash.\n\nBut that\u2019s just my two cents.",

He refers to the charitable foundation he set up in 2001, which he says has raised about $9.6m (\u00a36.1m), adding: \u201cI have not engaged in philanthropic efforts in order to make people forget about my past. To the contrary, I want people to remember my past so that I can serve as an example of how lives can be turned around and how people can be redeemed.\u201d\n\nThe 43-year-old says he is seeking the pardon because his past convictions still have an impact on his life, preventing him from becoming more active in law-enforcement activities \u201cincluding those that assist at-risk individuals\u201d but also for \u201cformal recognition that I am not the same person I was on the night of 8 April 1988 \u2026 My hope is that, if I receive a pardon, troubled youths will see this as an inspiration and motivation that they too can turn their lives around and be formally accepted into society.\u201d\n\nAccording to the sentencing memorandum for the crime, posted online, Wahlberg racially abused the shopkeeper, who was Vietnamese, during the attack. He makes no mention of this during the petition but claims the facts of his crime \u201chave sometimes been misreported\u201d.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with ABC News, the actor said he had never tried to find the man to make amends but was no longer burdened by guilt. \u201cYou have to go and ask for forgiveness, and it wasn\u2019t until I really started doing good and doing right, by other people as well as myself, that I really started to feel that guilt go away,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t have a problem going to sleep at night. I feel good when I wake up in the morning.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts parole board will review Wahlberg\u2019s case and make a recommendation to the governor, who has the ultimate authority to grant pardons but petitions are rarely issued in the state.\n\nLast month, the governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick, who is approaching the end of his eight years in office, approved four pardons, the first in the state since 2002.",

The new look sports a number of new features, all of which will end up getting integrated into the default design once feedback is garnered from the userbase.\n\nThere are a lot of interesting aspects to the new layout, most of which have to do with the organization of the data into different and user-defined groups, something that partially answers an issue I brought up with FriendFeed over the weekend.\n\nIn new functionality, though, there\u2019s the ability to upload photos with new posts to the system, allowing you to select and upload multiple files at once with no additional downloads required (just using the standard share button that\u2019s on every page).\n\nProbably the most useful feature in this update is the ability to define friend lists. They\u2019re designed to enable you to organize your friends into groups. This has long been a feature requested for services like FriendFeed and Twitter - the noise level that rises with adding new friends can interfere with the reliable communication you may have had with your close friends when you first set up your service. Despite the trademark spartan design on FriendFeed, keeping up with hundreds of folks is surprisingly easy, but in doing so, you\u2019ll probably notice as I did the decrease in intimacy with your core friends.\n\nThe friends lists can help remedy this, and by setting up the groups, you\u2019ll more easily be able to scan through and get a handle on what your buddies have been up to before heading on over to the white noise that is the combined feeds of all the people you\u2019re following.\n\nIf your goal is more noise, rather than less, you\u2019ll probably enjoy the newfound ability to see other people\u2019s home feeds.

    "text": "Does revealing the calories of dishes on menus change what people choose to eat? Sarah Nassauer and Scott Davis, Panera Bread Chief Concept & Innovation Officer, discuss on Lunch Break. Photo: Panera Bread.\n\nThe moment of truth: The creamy pasta dish sounds delicious, but it's 500 calories more than the grilled chicken and vegetables. Do you order it?\n\nIn many cases the answer is yes, say researchers who have studied what happens when calorie counts are included on menus.\n\nMore diners will open their menus to find calorie counts under a proposed federal law requiring the counts in restaurants with 20 or more locations. Health advocates and restaurants say the law could be finalized by the end of the year. A Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman says details of the law, first proposed as part of the 2010 health care bill, are still being worked out. It could also require grocery and convenience stores to list calories on prepared foods.\n\nMany restaurants are reworking recipes, swapping in whole milk for cream or putting less oil in cooking pans. Some are adding less sauce to dishes or offering smaller portions. Many are creating lower-calorie sections on menus or sticking to calorie guardrails, designing dishes to come in under 500 calories, for example. Several chains such as Starbucks Corp., McDonald's Corp., and Panera Bread Co., voluntarily post calories on menus nationally.\n\nGuess which restaurant items have fewer calories.\n\nThe restaurants hope to attract diners who say they want healthier options (even if they don't order them) and those who say they like to know calorie information (even if they end up ignoring it).\n\nResearch on how calorie information on menus influences purchasing behavior shows mixed results. Some large studies show that customers who said they noticed the information or were exposed to it for a longer period bought fewer calories.\n\nFor example, a study funded by the City of New York that reviewed about 15,000 receipts and surveys from fast-food lunch patrons before and after the city required those restaurants to list calories on menus showed no change in the average calories bought. But 1 in 6 people used the calorie information, and that group purchased an average of 96 fewer calories, an 11% decrease.\n\nStanford University used purchasing data at New York, Philadelphia, and Boston Starbucks locations over a 14-month period to compare consumer behavior in restaurants with and without calories on menus. Average calories per purchase fell 6% at restaurants with calorie counts on menus. (The reduction came entirely from food purchases, not drinks.)\n\nA handful of cities, including Seattle and Philadelphia, already require calorie counts on menus.\n\nThe Cheesecake Factory reduced calories in its Bistro Shrimp pasta by using less sauce. Next month it will be 2,440 calories, not 2,980.\n\nSmaller studies have shown that the calorie information has no effect on purchases. One recent example from Carnegie Mellon University showed that if customers are given a pamphlet with recommended calorie information before entering a restaurant that has menu calorie counts they purchase slightly more calories.\n\nSeventy-one percent of people say they want healthy options when they eat out, according to an internal survey from Darden Restaurants Inc., the largest full-service restaurant company in the U.S. and owner of chains including Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse.\n\n\"What's tricky is they might not always eat that way,\" says Cheryl Dolven, director of health and wellness for Darden. About 65% of people say they favor nutritional labeling in restaurants, according to a 2012 survey from Technomic Inc., a restaurant research and consulting firm.\n\nEarlier this year Darden hired five people to analyze the nutritional content of potential menu items at various points during research and development, says Ms. Dolven. Typically, Darden and other companies would do this testing right before a new dish goes onto menus, she says. Now Darden menu-development chefs use the team to understand \"wow, we are way over on calories and the calories are really driven by the oil in the saut\u00e9 pan,\" and then make adjustments, says Ms. Dolven.\n\nLower-calorie sections have been added to menus at many Darden Restaurants in recent years. LongHorn has a \"Flavorful Under 500\" menu and Olive Garden a \"Lighter Italian Fare\" section with items under 550 calories. Across all brands, it plans to reduce sodium and calories 10% by 2016 and 20% by 2021. Darden has featured menu calorie counts where mandated by law, about 180 restaurants.\n\n\"Some people hate it,\" says Ms. Dolven. They think \"uh, I didn't want to know that,\" she says.\n\nLast month a Drexel University study found fast-food restaurants in areas where calorie counts are required on menus have a higher percentage of healthy menu items, but showed no difference in the nutritional value of menus overall.\n\nRestaurant calorie counts aren't an exact science, as one cook might throw a larger handful of cheese into a salad than another. Industry executives say the federal law will likely provide some flexibility on accuracy as there is under FDA regulations for packaged food. For example, a box of cereal listed as 100 calories per serving can actually be up to 20% higher or 120 calories per serving.\n\nTo reduce calories, restaurants are scooping the dough out of bagels used for sandwiches or using less cheese among other tricks, says Betsy Craig, chief executive at MenuTrinfo, a Fort Collins, Colo.-based company that calculates nutritional information for restaurants and advises on recipes.\n\nPanera's Roast Turkey Artichoke Panini, a surprising 1,100 calories, was considered a 'gotcha' item for diners. It is now 780 calories.\n\nAfter years of landing on the annual Xtreme Eating list of high-calorie restaurant food published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the Cheesecake Factory is reducing calories in two pasta dishes by using less sauce, says David Overton, founder and chief executive of the Cheesecake Factory Inc., a 163-location chain. Next month, the Bistro Shrimp Pasta will fall to 2,440 calories from 2,980, according to the restaurant. The Kids' Pasta with Alfredo Sauce will be 1,290, down from 1,810. \"I was sick of winning that prize,\" says Mr. Overton of the CSPI list.\n\nAt Cheesecake Factory restaurants in areas where calories on menus are required, order behavior hasn't changed, he says. \"I don't think it's a way to change people's eating habits.\"\n\nThe proposed federal law exempts menu specials such as a \"soup of the day.\"\n\nA person needs between about 1,800 to 2,800 calories a day depending upon activity level, metabolism, gender and other factors, says Kristin Kirkpatrick, a dietitian and wellness manager at the Cleveland Clinic's Wellness Institute. Salads with creamy dressing or cheese, full-fat yogurt, smoothies, and anything fried can be unexpectedly high-calorie, she says.\n\nCalories are, of course, just one gauge of the healthfulness of a dish.\n\nSome restaurants wear calorie counts like a badge of honor\u2014and use them as a marketing tool. Mad Greens, an 11-location salad chain based in Denver, added calorie information to menus in 2010 as a way to try to stand out from other quick restaurant meals, says chief executive and co-founder Marley Hodgson.\n\n\"Our goal is to kind of get close to a 500- or 600-calorie meal,\" says Scott Davis, chief concept and innovation officer for Panera, which says it was the first national chain to introduce calorie information on menus nationally in 2010. When the company first compiled nutritional information in 2008 it reworked some \"gotcha\" items\u2014for example, a turkey artichoke panini with a deceptively high 1,100 calories.\n\nOn a current Panera menu of limited-time dishes, in order to come in around 300 calories, salads are served with a side of olive oil and half a lemon that can be squeezed on as dressing, Mr. Davis says.\n\nStill, he thinks \"the majority of people walk right by,\" calorie information on menus, though over time more people have begun taking notice, he says. \"I think it's one of those things that will take years to understand.\"\n\nWrite to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com",

    "text": "To put it mildly, this is one gem of a gem.\n\nScientists using two different age-determining techniques have shown that a tiny zircon crystal found on a sheep ranch in western Australia is the oldest known piece of our planet, dating to 4.4 billion years ago.\n\nThis zircon, which is about twice the width of a human hair, is now confirmed to be the oldest bit of the Earth's crust ever discovered. It was found in the Jack Hills region of Australia. (Courtesy John W. Valley/University of Wisconsin-Madison)\n\nWriting in the journal Nature Geoscience on Sunday, the international team of researchers said the discovery indicates that Earth's crust formed relatively soon after the planet formed and that the little gem was a remnant of it.\n\nJohn Valley, a University of Wisconsin geoscience professor who led the research, said the findings suggest that the early Earth was not as harsh a place as many scientists have thought.\n\nTo determine the age of the zircon fragment, the scientists first used a widely accepted dating technique based on determining the radioactive decay of uranium to lead in a mineral sample.\n\nBut because some scientists hypothesized that this technique might give a false date due to possible movement of lead atoms within the crystal over time, the researchers turned to a second sophisticated method to verify the finding.\n\nThey used a technique known as atom-probe tomography that was able to identify individual atoms of lead in the crystal and determine their mass.\n\nDesmond Moser and Ivan Barker, two scientists at Western University in London, Ont., checked the crystal for signs of meteorite impact and crystal damage. That allowed them to identify the best-preserved parts of the crystal to probe \u2014 \"the ones that had the best chance of preserving chemical information from the Earth's beginning,\" said Moser in a statement.\n\nAtom-probe tomography confirmed that the zircon was indeed 4.4 billion years old.\n\nTo put that age in perspective, the Earth itself formed 4.5 billion years ago as a ball of molten rock, meaning that its crust formed relatively soon thereafter, 100 million years later. The age of the crystal also means that the crust appeared just 160 million years after the very formation of the solar system.\n\nThe finding supports the notion of a \"cool early Earth\" where temperatures were low enough to sustain oceans, and perhaps life, earlier than previously thought, Valley said.\n\nThis period of Earth history is known as the Hadean eon, named for ancient Greek god of the underworld Hades because of hellish conditions including meteorite bombardment and an initially molten surface.\n\n\"One of the things that we're really interested in is: when did the Earth first become habitable for life? When did it cool off enough that life might have emerged?\" Valley said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe discovery that the zircon crystal, and thereby the formation of the crust, dates from 4.4 billion years ago suggests that the planet was perhaps capable of sustaining microbial life 4.3 billion years ago, Valley said.\n\n\"We have no evidence that life existed then. We have no evidence that it didn't. But there is no reason why life could not have existed on Earth 4.3 billion years ago,\" he added.\n\nThe oldest fossil records of life are stromatolites produced by an archaic form of bacteria from about 3.4 billion years ago.\n\nThe zircon was extracted in 2001 from a rock outcrop in Australia's Jack Hills region. For a rock of such importance, it is rather small. It measures only about 200 by 400 microns, about twice the diameter of a human hair.\n\n\"Zircons can be large and very pretty. But the ones we work on are small and not especially attractive except to a geologist,\" Valley said. \"If you held it in the palm of your hand, if you have good eyesight you could see it without a magnifying glass.\"",

    "text": "In 2008, the last time the S&P 500 plunged, losing 37% of its value, people bailed out of stocks. The result: Many of these market evacuees weren\u2019t invested come March 2009, when stocks began a long rally that erased those losses and went on to hit record levels. Recently, the market has been gyrating again, beginning 2016 with the worst start of a year ever, only to rebound, regaining nearly all of this year\u2019s losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe question is whether investors were any better at keeping their cool this time around, or were they worse. Either way, the answer might have something to do with the type of adviser more and more people are hiring to manage their money these days\u2014robots. Indeed, the frustration with their experience in the market\u2014poor performance on the way down and poor advice on the way up\u2014has led more people to ditch their financial advisers for low-cost robo-advisers services, which are not actual robots but firms that say they can better manage your investment portfolio using computers.\n\nBut the question is whether these computer-driven firms will be better at keeping investors away from trouble spots and in the market when it rebounds than actual human financial advisers were. Investors\u2019 relationships with the automated services tend to be impersonal. After all, it\u2019s done on a screen. While some robos do provide 800 numbers with a few actual certified financial planners on the other end, the lines will be jammed during a market rout.\n\nNonetheless, Robo-advisers are all the rage. The current narrative suggests that they will decimate entrenched financial advisers. Riding a torrent of favorable publicity, they come across as noble rebels fighting for individuals against the predations of greedy and arrogant Wall Street advisory establishment. The first of these digital advisors appeared about 10 years ago. The financial crisis, when so many stock-picking advisors lost big money for clients, boosted the robos\u2019 standing. Led by rapidly growing companies like Wealthfront, Betterment, and FutureAdviser, they today manage some $53 billion in assets, according to Aite Group researchers. And new research suggests that these firms are nabbing not just Millennials, but increasingly older, and high-net-worth individuals. Consulting firm A.T. Kearney predicts the newer services will surge, managing as much as $2.2 trillion by 2020.\n\nThe robos do have some powerful advantages. They beat flesh-and-blood advisors on price, often charging as little as 0.25% yearly to run your money. That\u2019s a bargain compared to a legacy asset manager, who charges 1% of assets. They don\u2019t peddle dreck investments, which generate fat commissions for an old-school brokerage. And you can access them from the comfort of your home, without having to trek to some office.\n\nYou need only fill out an online questionnaire, asking you about things like your age and risk tolerance. Then an algorithm chews on the information, produces a list of investments and shows how much money will be plugged into each. Usually, the investments are in low-cost exchange-traded funds that track market indexes, such as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500.\n\nTrouble is, there are also some seldom-recognized downsides to robo-advisers:\n\nThe advice tends to be cookie-cutter. The investment palette you receive may make sense in terms of your stomach for risk and your age group. (For instance, a Millennial\u2019s portfolio should be more loaded with stocks, which statistically do better at creating wealth over time, than a baby boomer\u2019s, who has fewer years to recover from a bear market.) But that\u2019s not enough. Too seldom, the robos rely on what your situation is now, not what your long-term goals are. How will you pay for your kid\u2019s college? Will you be able to buy that vacation home? When should you retire?\n\nPlus, the robos\u2019 focus on index ETFs. That\u2019s not a bad strategy for most of your money. The odds of anyone outpacing the S&P 500 or any other market benchmark are small. It happens about a third of the time for actively managed mutual funds. But there are a few money managers who have done it more than others, and some people have grown increasingly worried that index funds, after years of inflows, could be creating their own bubble. You won\u2019t hear that from a robo-adviser.\n\nThe robos don\u2019t cover needs beyond investing. Good luck trying to find out how much insurance you should have. Or the smartest method to minimize taxes. Or the best way to set up your estate. Or how to re-arrange your life once you retire. While you may rack up solid investment returns with a robo-adviser, if you hit someone in a car accident, you may end up depleting your nest egg to pay for the victim\u2019s injuries and lost income.\n\nPersonal insights go missing in the robo experience. It\u2019s impossible for an algorithm to know your every need. Ditto for someone on the other end of a toll-free number, who changes every time you call and lacks a personal relationship with you.\n\nLet\u2019s say you and your spouse are on the brink of divorce. A real-life financial adviser can walk you both through the financial realities a split would bring. That\u2019s because the adviser knows your entire background: your child\u2019s learning disability, your aging parents\u2019 care needs, and your underwater mortgage.\n\nBut the larger question is whether robos will render traditional advisers obsolete. In the near term, that would be a tall order. Of the $19 trillion in assets under advisers\u2019 management, a mere 0.2% belongs to the robos, according to Aite Group.\n\nFurther out, though, prospects for automated investing seem to be bright. Baby boomers heavily populate the ranks of legacy advisors and their clients. But Millennials, who now outnumber boomers, grew up on technology. The robos\u2019 approach resonates with them, and they are, after all, the future.\n\nThat\u2019s the argument of Adam Nash, 40, chief executive of Wealthfront, which has amassed $3 billion in assets in just four years of existence. His organization\u2019s computers watch over client investments around the clock. They automatically perform such tasks as tax-loss harvesting, where Wealthfront sells declining investments at a loss, and uses them to offset taxable gains elsewhere in a portfolio. But that\u2019s something that traditional advisers and actively managed mutual funds have long done.\n\nThanks to inexorable demographics, a sea change likely is coming, one that will eradicate a lot of advisers, and not just the entrenched players. So says Ric Edelman, 57, who founded his Edelman Financial Services in 1988. Catering to fellow baby boomers, he built it into a 42-branch powerhouse with $14.5 billion in managed assets. \u201cIn 10 years, half of the nation\u2019s financial advisers will be gone,\u201d he predicts. But he also predicts the next bear market will wipe out the current crop of robos, too, when frightened customers flee and their venture capital funding dries up. Investors often get excited about the newest investment fad in up markets, only to be disappointed when it inevitably leads to losses when the market drops.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s logical that as Millennials age they will want face-to-face advice. As their financial lives grow more complex and their responsibilities multiply, they will \u201cgraduate to more traditional financial planners,\u201d predicts Michael Kitces, a noted advice industry guru.\n\nIn the meantime, the appeal of automated investing is strong enough that long-established companies\u2014Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Vanguard\u2014have started their own online efforts. They have the heft to give the robo start-ups some trouble.",

    "text": "On a foggy day in August 1936, an anthropologist and his crew set sail for Kagamil Island, a small volcanic speck of hot springs and cliffs in the Bering Sea. A person identified as \u201cBrown Bear\u201d had told them of a cave full of mummies and other human remains. Shortly after landing, they found the opening in the rocks near a steam jet.\n\nAccording to the notes of the anthropologist, Ales Hrdlicka, the cave contained \u201cwonderful riches\u201d:\n\n\u201cSpace within cave is limited, in most of it one can not stand up, in none of it can use shovels; must work with hands like badgers. ... As the salt deposit is penetrated into, there appears mummy after mummy, in different states of preservation \u2014 male, female and especially children ... a huge whale shoulder blade ... two entire kayaks.\u201d\n\nNearly 80 years later, the mummies from Kagamil and elsewhere have excited the interest of scientists who say what they have learned from the remains challenges a central tenet of conventional thinking about what we ought to eat.\n\nHeart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., is often blamed on modern diets and a sedentary lifestyle. According to this thinking, if only people ate the \u201cright\u201d foods and exercised more, they could live longer. This view is encapsulated in the current version of the government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are under review and being reissued soon. They have long recommended dietary habits deemed good for your heart \u2014 lower intakes of saturated fat and salt, more emphasis on lean meat and seafood.\n\n\u201cPoor diet and physical inactivity are associated with major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States,\u201d according to those guidelines.\n\nBut examinations of the bodies of the Unangans from Kagamil Island and other pre-modern people indicate that, in fact, the modern scourge of heart disease is not at all new, and that people who exercised more than we do as a matter of necessity, and whose diet was free from modern temptations, also suffered striking levels of heart disease, according to the researchers.\n\nIn recent years, X-ray based scans of mummies from around the world - including the hunter gatherers of Kagamil as well as those from ancient Egypt, Peru and the American Southwest \u2014 found signs of heart disease or atherosclerosis, the plaque lining the arteries near the heart.\n\nEven the reconstructed man shown above, who lived 5,000 years ago, showed signs of atherosclerosis. His mummified remains were discovered in the Italian Alps in September 1991.\n\n[Congress: We need to review the Dietary Guidelines for Americans]\n\n[For decades, the government steered millions away from whole milk. Was that wrong?]\n\nFor years, scientists have argued over the extent to which modern diets ought to be blamed for the high rates of heart disease. As an American Heart Association publication summarizes: \"There can be little doubt that the Western diet is closely tied to the development of atherosclerosis.\"\n\nThis belief is widely shared, but it has led to a fierce debate over how exactly people ought to reform their diet. Many leading health groups, including the American Heart Association, have concluded that a person's heart disease risk depends on \"both the quantity and quality of fat in an individual's diet,\" and they urge people to reduce the amount of animal products \u2014 especially beef, pork and lamb \u2014 that they consume.\n\nThat approach has met strong criticism in recent years by critics who argue instead that a diet rich in proteins and lower in carbohydrates \u2014 the so-called \"cave man\" approach \u2014 makes it easier to maintain a stable weight and metabolism.\n\nThe new research may undercut both positions. By turning up evidence of heart disease in populations with widely varying diets, the mummy research suggests that maybe some other unrecognized cause is at work besides what we choose to eat.\n\n\u201cAlthough commonly assumed to be a modern disease, the presence of atherosclerosis in pre-modern human beings raises the possibility of a more basic predisposition to the disease,\u201d according to the researchers, who include specialists in cardiology, X-rays, anthropology and other fields.\n\nAs the research has found its way over the years into some of the world\u2019s most esteemed medical journals, including the Lancet, which in 2013 published an article about four groups of mummies, critics of the work have charged that the number of mummies that have been examined is relatively small \u2014 only a couple hundred or so \u2014 and insufficient to support broad conclusions. Moreover, the bodies have been dead a long time, and maybe some other chemical changes create the appearance of arterial plaque.\n\nBut the very basic reaction to the mummy research has been this: Given all the research linking heart disease and diet, the results were too unlikely to believe.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion the ancient populations did intense physical activity and followed a diet rich in vegetable, free from saturated fats, and therefore [had a] low risk of developing atherosclerosis,\u201d Gino Fornaciari a paleopathologist at the University of Pisa, wrote in an email.\n\nIn the past, he said, only \u201celite individuals\u201d such as kings would have suffered from atherosclerosis because they could have afforded foods that match those of the modern diet.\n\nHe said inaccuracies in reading the scans of tissues that were long dead, and dessicated, might have led to inaccuracies in conclusions. The scans, known as CT scans for computerized tomography, are based on computerized analysis of multiple X-ray images. The plaque that causes heart disease consists in part of calcium; those calcified remnants remain in the mummies and show up in the scans.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of my long experience,\u201d Fornaciari said, many false findings are possible.\n\nBut the mummy researchers, including cardiologists who look at such scans in living humans, note that the appearance of the atherosclerosis in the CT scans in the mummies is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the appearance of atherosclerosis in their patients.\n\nThis similarity, they said, makes it unlikely that some change in the ancient bodies has created an illusion of atherosclerosis.\n\nIndeed, other researchers find the evidence of ancient heart disease around the world compelling.\n\n\u201cThese results confirm that atherosclerosis was present in ancient civilisations with wide cultural differences,\u201d Anthony M. Heagerty, a cardiologist at the University of Manchester, wrote in response to the Lancet article, citing other research along similar lines.\n\nMoreover, the researchers can point to other evidence indicating that heart disease is an ancient affliction.\n\nOne text from Egypt dating as far back as 1550 BCE said: \u201cIf thou examinst a man for illness in his cardia, and he has pains in his arms, in his breast and on one side of his cardia \u2026 it is death threatening him.\u201d\n\nWhat is more difficult to know from the mummies is how far advanced the heart disease might have been in the individuals, or how much they may have felt the symptoms.\n\nBut the scientists said that some of the signs of heart disease appear to have been severe enough that they very likely caused people to suffer. For example, scientists point specifically to one of the mummies from Kagamil Island, a 40-ish woman who lived about 1900.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about her is that she would have had a marine diet, and consumed a lot of fish oil,\u201d said one of the researchers, Gregory Thomas, medical director of the Heart Institute at Long Beach Memorial Hospital in Long Beach, Calif. \u201cShe ate plenty of sea lions and whale and fish. Inland there would have been berries and leaves.\"\n\nYet the scientists found evidence of severe atherosclerosis in two of the three arteries that supply blood to the heart.\n\nFor the cardiologists like Thomas among the researchers, the ramifications of the work are not merely academic. They have changed the way they think about the conventional diet advice typically dispensed to heart patients.\n\nRandall Thompson, a cardiologist at St. Luke\u2019s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City and a professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, said the research has changed the way he views what we can do to prevent heart disease.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m a clinical cardiologist and I want people to eat a healthy diet, but this puts all that in perspective. ... At least part of this disease is not explained by traditional risk factors. These ancient people didn\u2019t have preservatives, everything was organic, they didn\u2019t smoke and they got plenty of exercise. But ... the amount of atherosclerosis in ancient times isn\u2019t much different from what you see in modern times. If you account for age, it looks like we\u2019re in the same ballpark.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I became a cardiologist 30 years ago, I was pretty dogmatic about the low-fat, low-cholesterol diet to prevent heart disease. [But] we\u2019ve been unable to find a culture without atherosclerosis and I\u2019m not really sure what to eat, personally, to delay atherosclerosis, or what to recommend to patients. Of late, I tell people to stay lean.\u201d\n\nStaying lean, he says, keeps cholesterol levels in the bloodstream lower, and helps stave off heart disease.\n\n\u201cWe have this wistful hope that if we go back to nature that we would markedly delay atherosclerosis,\" Thomas said. \"But these people ate a natural diet, and they still had heart disease. I no longer think that way.\u201d\n\nA government panel said drinking coffee is harmless. Why that might be wrong.\n\nIs the American diet too salty? Scientists challenge the longstanding government warning\n\nThe U.S. government is poised to withdraw longstanding warnings about cholesterol",
    "summary": "The high rate of heart disease in developed countries is often blamed on modern diets and sedentary habits. But analyses of mummies of ancient people - who ate \"natural\" diets and stayed active - also reveal signs of arterial plaque and heart disease."

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the total amount of money spent by the Obama campaign in 2008 came in at $730 million, far outspending Republican nominee John McCain who spent a mere $333 million. Obama became the first major party candidate to reject public campaign funding, which allowed him to not fall under some campaign finance laws that may have limited his fundraising efforts. How much more was spent in 2008, than previous years? The Obama Campaign raised nearly twice as much money as the Bush campaign in 2004, which, at the time, was the most expensive campaign in history.\n\nThis year, once the Obama campaign gets in to full swing, he may spend $1 billion in his attempt to be reelected.

John Osbon of Osbon Capital Management noted that the recent bear market might be good for Barack Obama's reputation if he's elected president. By starting with the Dow near 9,000, Obama is enjoying the political equivalent of \"buying low.\" George W. Bush took office as the market peaked--an unfortunate bit of market timing for the outgoing president.\n\nCarol Pepper, president of Pepper International and a member of the Women's Leadership Forum of the Democratic National Committee, is of course looking forward to an Obama presidency and a return to Clinton-era bull markets. If Obama wins, she says, investors might want to look at alternative-energy companies and companies that will make money from the carbon trading market that would result if Obama were to implement a cap-and-trade system to limit carbon emissions. Though Pepper didn't name any stocks, Duke Energy (nyse: DUK - news - people ) would almost certainly be involved in such a project.\n\nAnother possibility--a 2008 study by two professors from the Innsbruck University School of Management in Austria suggests that companies who make big donations to presidential candidates generate better-than-normal stock returns if they gave to the winning candidate.\n\nOsbon also notes that there are political questions that won't wait for the elections. One is that Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke now believes that the U.S. needs some fiscal stimulus in addition to all of the supply-side liquidity that the Treasury and Fed have pumped into the system. House speaker Nancy Pelosi might want to spend $300 billion on infrastructure, unemployment benefits and state aid, Osbon says.\n\nThe result: \"Many experts believe taxes must go up since the budget deficit is now a record $438 billion. On top of a $650 billion trade deficit, the U.S. is now funding $1 trillion with borrowed money against a $14 trillion economy, or about a 7% rate. Obviously, this situation cannot last without some repricing of the dollar, or some fiscal deficit relief in the form of higher taxes. What to do? We indexers take advantage of the upside-down world of the municipal bond market by owning SPDR Lehman Municipal Bond ETF and the iShares S&P Municipal Bond Fund, the two major municipal-bond ETFs,\" Obson says.\n\nThe Investor Team also talked about hedge funds. Osbon had a lively exchange with Stephen Roseman, a principal at Thesis Capital Management. The two agreed that some major hedge funds have been forced into crowded trades of late, and Osbon thinks redemptions by hedge fund investors are greater than what's being reported. Osbon also speculated that Citadel is being forced to sell some securities. Roseman cautioned against speculating about specific names.\n\nSince he's in the industry, Roseman is also in the perfect position to warn against an unfortunate media habit when it comes to hedge funds: \"Talking about hedge fund strategies as a homogeneous group is akin to talking about an American's 'typical' life experience. They are incredibly varied, even within a subset of similar strategies.\"\n\nFinally, of interest to retail investors, Osbon and Pepper discuss the proper uses of ETFs. Osbon is an efficient-markets believer, so he stays away from ETFs wedded to managed or quantitative models in favor of those that follow broad-based, traditional indexes.",

Instead, they suggest there may be a small genetic or hormonal link between the two.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a concern for women with moles, because we don\u2019t think the relationship is causal,\u201d said Marina Kvaskoff, the lead author of one of the new studies.\n\nKvaskoff is affiliated with INSERM - the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research - and the University of Paris 11.\n\nResearchers suspected that moles, also known as nevi, and breast cancer might share links to certain hormones and genes. That would mean moles could be used to help predict a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk.\n\n\u201cWe always need to discover more causes of cancer and breast cancer in particular,\u201d Kvaskoff said. \u201cIf more studies were to find nevi were associated with breast cancer risk, then nevi could become a risk marker for breast cancer risk.\u201d\n\nIn one of the studies, researchers led by Mingfeng Zhang at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston used data collected on 74,523 female nurses between 1986 and 2010 to measure women\u2019s breast cancer risk by the number of moles on their arms.\n\nWomen with no moles had about an 8.5 percent chance of developing breast cancer during the study, compared to an 11.4 percent chance of breast cancer among women with 15 or more moles on their left arm.\n\nAmong women who had already gone through menopause, Zhang and her colleagues found those with six or more moles had higher levels of estrogen and testosterone in their blood, compared to women without moles.\n\nAfter adjusting their data to account for the differing hormone levels, the researchers found the link between moles and breast cancer disappeared.\n\nIn the other study that was led by Kvaskoff, researchers found that French women who reported having \u201cvery many moles\u201d were 13 percent more likely to develop breast cancer between 1990 and 2008 than women who had no moles. That study included 89,902 total women.\n\nThe association disappeared after the researchers adjusted the data to account for other breast cancer risk factors, including family history of breast cancer.\n\nKvaskoff said the findings suggest that the link between the number of moles a woman has and her risk of breast cancer could be genetic or hormonal. Her team did not have the data to take hormones into account, however.\n\nThe new studies, published in PLOS Medicine, are also limited because they mostly relied on white women. Additionally, one study asked women to report their own moles, which may be unreliable.\n\nKvaskoff said the magnitude of the associations the researchers found was small, which suggests moles may not be an important risk factor.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the new studies, Barbara Fuhrman and Victor Cardenas from the University of Arkansas in Little Rock write that more research is needed.\n\nThey say that they hope additional studies will add information on the relationship between moles and breast cancer, and help with the assessment of breast cancer risk.\n\nFor now, Kvaskoff said the biggest risk of moles is skin cancer.\n\n\u201cWomen in general should always get their moles checked for this reason,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be a concern with breast cancer.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1pkIjK0, bit.ly/1oOFCPc and bit.ly/1n6qd9I PLOS Medicine, online June 10, 2014.",

Subscribers pay $70 a month for the first line, $50 for the second and $20 a month for additional lines.\n\nThe wireless provider already offers an unlimited data plan, but unlimited data is for an added price on top of the traditional cell phone plan.

Since Legere took over the company in 2012, T-Mobile has made an aggressive play for customers from the bigger wireless companies, Verizon and AT&T. Thursday's announcement called out both networks.\n\nT-Mobile claims that Verizon and AT&T couldn't offer a totally unlimited plan because their networks are too outdated and overcrowded.\n\n\"Their networks are old. They built them with last generation technology for how people used phones back then \u2014 just for phone calls,\" Legere said.\n\nBut not everyone is excited by T-Mobile's new approach to data. The Simple Choice Unlimited plan T-Mobile already offers is $95, with a $10 monthly discount for adding a tablet and phone line. Some customers claim it works out to a better deal than the new option.\n\nPlus, data through T-Mobile ONE isn't completely unlimited. Video streaming is limited to standard definition unless customers pay an additional $25 a month for access to high definition. Customers using more than 26GB of data a month have their traffic prioritized behind other users during high network demand after crossing a billing threshold. Tethering \u2014 or turning on a wifi hotspot \u2014 is capped at a 2G speed.\n\nStill, T-Mobile expects this plan to increase customer loyalty and pointed out in its release that the plans were taken into account for its guidance in its July 27 earnings call.\n\nThe T-Mobile ONE plan will take effect September 6.\n\n\"Who knows?

It said the jury charge was far from the way instructions should be: clear, concise and to the point. It returned the case to the trial court for a new trial.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of our criminal justice system is the right to a fair trial. Raul was denied this right due to incorrect jury instructions,\u201d defense attorney Neal Davis told the Houston Chronicle. \u201cNow Raul will have the chance to have a fair day in court.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said they were disappointed and likely would appeal the ruling.\n\n\u201cThis was a hard-fought conviction that we had hoped would stand,\u201d said Clint Morgan, a Harris County assistant district attorney.\n\nIn a 22-minute video he recorded the night of the shooting, Rodriguez, a retired Houston firefighter, can be heard telling a police dispatcher he called that \u201cmy life is in danger now\u201d and \u201cthese people are going to go try and kill me.\u201d He then said, \u201cI\u2019m standing my ground here,\u201d and shot Kelly Danaher.\n\nRodriguez\u2019s reference to standing his ground was similar to the claim made by George Zimmerman, a Florida neighborhood watch volunteer who cited that state\u2019s stand-your-ground law in his defense. He was acquitted of murder for the February 2012 fatal shooting of an unarmed teenager, Trayvon Martin.\n\nIn Texas, the version of the law is known as the Castle Doctrine and was revised in 2007 to expand the right to use deadly force by allowing people to defend themselves in their homes, workplaces or vehicles. It also says a person using force cannot provoke the attacker or be involved in criminal activity at the time.",

    "text": "BEIJING, Aug. 24, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Qunar Cayman Islands Limited (NASDAQ:QUNR) (\"Qunar\" or the \"Company\"), China's leading mobile and online travel platform, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015.\n\nHighlights for the Second Quarter of 2015\n\n\"Qunar's year-on-year revenue growth reached 120% in Q2, the fifth consecutive quarter of over 100% growth. Momentum continued to be very strong across business lines,\" said Chenchao (CC) Zhuang, chief executive officer and co-founder of Qunar. \"The solid results reflect the ongoing progress of our key initiatives, most notably in the areas of growing our mobile user base and expanding our hotel direct business, with mobile revenues up 322% year-on-year and hotel volume up 145% year-on-year in Q2.\"\n\n\"We are proud of the strong returns generated from our investment in mobile and in building our hotel supply chain, and are particularly encouraged by the results of the offline campaign we started in Q2,\" said Yilu Zhao, chief financial officer of Qunar. \"Our Q2 results exceeded previous guidance for both revenue and operating margin. We will continue to execute on our ROI-driven growth strategy and look forward to further fortifying Qunar's position as the leading mobile and online travel platform in China.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2015 Financial Results\n\nTotal revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB881.0 million (US$142.1 million), after deducting cash discounts and rebates from the coupon programs in the amount of RMB192.9 million (US$31.1 million), an increase of 120.0% year-on-year and 31.3% quarter-on-quarter.\n\nMobile revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB600.1 million (US$96.8 million), an increase of 321.7% year-on-year, representing 68.1% of total revenues.\n\nFlight and flight related revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB517.0 million (US$83.4 million), an increase of 85.0% year-on-year and 13.1% quarter-on-quarter. Year-on-year flight and flight related revenue growth was primarily due to a 46.9% increase in TEFT and a 25.9% increase in revenue per ticket.\n\nAccommodation reservation revenues were RMB258.9 million (US$41.8million), an increase of 261.8% year-on-year and 101.8% quarter-on-quarter. Year-on-year accommodation reservation revenue growth was primarily due to a 145.2% increase in TEHR and 47.6% increase in revenue per room night.\n\nGross profit for the second quarter of 2015 was RMB634.1 million (US$102.3 million), an increase of 115.1% year-on-year. Gross margin for the second quarter of 2015 was 72.0%, compared to 73.6% for the corresponding period of 2014 and 73.1% for the first quarter of 2015. The year-on-year increase in gross profit during the quarter was primarily due to the significant increase in total revenues.\n\nProduct development expenses for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB350.8 million (US$56.6 million), an increase of 93.2% year-on-year, primarily due to an increase over the same period last year in salary, welfare and other expenses associated with headcount increases. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, product development expenses were RMB330.5 million (US$53.3 million), an increase of 97.3% year-on-year, and accounted for 37.5% of total revenues, compared to 41.8% for the corresponding period of 2014 and 39.9% for the first quarter of 2015.\n\nProduct sourcing expenses for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB134.5 million (US$21.7 million), an increase of 98.8% year-on-year, primarily due to an increase over the same period last year in product sourcing headcount. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, product sourcing expenses were RMB132.4 million (US$21.4 million), an increase of 95.7% year-on-year, and accounted for 15.0% of total revenues, compared to 16.9% for the corresponding period of 2014 and 18.4% for the first quarter of 2015.\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB702.7million (US$113.3 million), an increase of 226.8% year-on-year, primarily due to stepped up discretionary expenditures to acquire new mobile users through offline channels, and to a lesser degree an increase in online marketing expenses as well as salary and welfare expenses as a result of increased headcount. The headcount expenses under sales and marketing were primarily expenses related to personnel with operational functions, including our customer service staff, photographers, editors, and staff responsible for data analysis. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, sales and marketing expenses were RMB694.7 million (US$112.0 million), an increase of 228.0% year-on-year, and accounted for 78.9% of total revenues, compared to 52.9% for the corresponding period of 2014 and 47.7% for the first quarter of 2015.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB134.4 million (US$21.7 million), an increase of 20.2% year-on-year, primarily due to an increase in salary and welfare expenses associated with headcount increases. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, general and administrative expenses were RMB88.0 million (US$14.2 million), an increase of 65.7% year-on-year, and accounted for 10.0% of total revenues, compared to 13.3% for the corresponding period of 2014 and 10.5% for the first quarter of 2015.\n\nOnline marketing expenses for the Company's Baidu Zhixin Cooperation for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB6.9 million (US$1.1 million), a decrease of 95.3% year-on-year. The decrease was primarily due to the termination of Baidu Zhixin Cooperation in the second quarter of 2015.\n\nOperating loss for the second quarter of 2015 was RMB695.2 million (US$112.1 million), compared to RMB429.0 million in the corresponding period of 2014 and RMB411.2 million in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nOperating loss on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes share-based compensation expenses of RMB76.8 million (US$12.4 million) and online marketing expenses from the Zhixin Cooperation Agreement of RMB6.9 million (US$1.1 million), was RMB611.5 million (US$98.6 million) for the second quarter of 2015. Operating margin (non-GAAP) for the second quarter of 2015 was negative 69.4%, compared to negative 50.9% in the corresponding period of 2014 and negative 43.4% in the first quarter of 2015. The year-on-year increase in operating loss was mainly attributable to an ROI-driven, aggressive marketing strategy, and continued investment in product development and product sourcing to accelerate rapid market share gains, especially development of the Company's hotel direct business.\n\nFair value change in warrant liability for the second quarter of 2015 was RMB109.8 million (US$17.7 million), compared to nil in the corresponding period and RMB288.2 million in the first quarter of 2015. Fair value change in warrant liability represents changes in the fair value of the first tranche of Baidu warrants vested on January 15, 2015. Such warrants were continuously accounted for as a liability until Baidu exercised the warrants in early June 2015. There was no such fair value change in the corresponding period of 2014.\n\nNet loss attributable to Qunar's shareholders for the second quarter of 2015 was RMB815.7 million (US$131.6 million), compared to RMB421.6 million in the corresponding period of 2014 and RMB701.2million in the first quarter of 2015. The increase in net loss was primarily due to reasons mentioned above. Basic and diluted net loss per ADS for the second quarter of 2015 was RMB6.66 (US$1.08).\n\nAdjusted net loss (non-GAAP), defined as net loss excluding share-based compensation expenses of RMB76.8 million (US$12.4 million), online marketing expenses from the Zhixin Cooperation Agreement of RMB6.9 million (US$1.1 million) and fair value change in warrant liability of RMB109.8 million (US$17.7 million), for the second quarter of 2015 was RMB623.8 million (US$100.6 million), compared to adjusted net loss of RMB196.5 million in the corresponding period of 2014 and adjusted net loss of RMB293.4 million in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), defined as net loss before income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, further adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expenses of RMB76.8 million (US$12.4 million), online marketing expenses from the Zhixin Cooperation Agreement of RMB6.9 million (US$1.1 million), fair value change in warrant liability of RMB109.8 million (US$17.7 million), for the second quarter of 2015 was negative RMB575.3 million (US$92.8 million), compared to negative RMB183.2 million in the corresponding period of 2014 and negative RMB262.5 million in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nQunar entered into a US$300 million revolving credit facility agreement with Baidu on February 27, 2014. The agreement has a term of three years and any drawdown bears an annual interest rate of 90% of the benchmark lending rate published by the People's Bank of China and shall be repaid within three years from the drawdown date. Qunar may repay the outstanding debt obligation at maturity either by cash or by our shares. The applicable share conversion price will be determined by the prevailing share price at the maturity date. On March 12 and May 4, 2015, Qunar drew down RMB507 million and RMB627 million, respectively, from Baidu according to the revolving credit facility agreement with the plan to use the funds for the Company's operational and investment needs.\n\nQunar issued a 2% senior unsecured convertible notes with a conversion price of $55 per ADS in the amount of US$500 million on June 17 2015. Qunar also offered 6,842,106 American Depositary Shares through a public offering priced at US$47.50 per ADS on June 5, 2015.\n\nAs of June 30, 2015, Qunar had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, funds receivables and short-term investment of RMB6,411.1 million (US$1,034.1 million).\n\nAs of June 30, 2015, Qunar had 224,299,179 Class A ordinary shares and 168,520,421 Class B ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2015, Qunar expects year-on-year revenue growth in the estimated range of 140% to 145% and year-on-year growth of gross profit in the estimated range of 105% to 110%. These forecasts reflect Qunar's current and preliminary view based on current market and operating conditions, which is subject to change, and such change may be material.\n\nQunar's management will hold an earnings conference call at 9:00 PM on August 24, 2015, U.S. Eastern Time (9:00 AM on August 25, 2015, Beijing/Hong Kong Time).\n\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\n\nA replay of the conference call may be accessed by phone at the following number until August 31, 2015:\n\nAdditionally, a live and archived webcast of this conference call will be available at http://investor.qunar.com.\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

Qunar may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Qunar's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: the Company's goals and strategies; its future business development, financial condition and results of operations; the expected growth of the online travel markets in China; the Company's expectations regarding demand for and market acceptance of its products and services; its expectations regarding relationships with users and travel service providers; the business cooperation agreement with Baidu; its plans to invest in the technology platform; competition in the industry; fluctuations in general economic and business conditions in China; and relevant government policies and regulations relating to the industry.

These non-GAAP financial measures enable management to assess the Company's operating results without considering the impact of noncash charges, including share-based payments, depreciation and amortization, online marketing expenses from the Zhixin Cooperation Agreement and fair value change in warrant liability. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures eliminate the impact of items that Qunar does not consider indicative of the performance of its business.\n\nQunar presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate its operating performance, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions on capital allocation. Qunar also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating performance and consolidated results of operations in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of its peer companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures do not include all items that impact the Company's results of operations for the period. The table captioned \"Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP Measures\" has more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. The conversion of Renminbi (RMB) into U.S. dollars is based on the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on June 30, 2015, which was RMB6.2000 to US$1.00. The Company makes no representation that any Renminbi or U.S. dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars or Renminbi, as the case may be, at any particular rate, or at all. The percentages stated are calculated based on the RMB amounts.\n\nQunar is China's leading mobile and online travel platform.

(Getty Images)\n\nFerocious fighting rages in Ukraine as Kiev and the US accuse Russia of fuelling a rebel onslaught to grab territory in the hours before a truce began.\n\nKiev-loyal regional police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin said constant artillery bombardments were razing the strategic railway hub of Debaltseve, where Ukrainian forces were hanging on.\n\n\"The rebels are destroying the town of Debaltseve. There are non-stop artillery bombardments of residential areas and buildings. The town is in flames,\" Abroskin wrote on Facebook.\n\nUkraine's Azov volunteer battalion also reported fierce clashes just to the east of the vital government-held port city of Mariupol and said that the village of Shyrokyne had been \"practically destroyed\" by shelling.\n\nThe ceasefire, due to take effect from 2200 GMT Saturday (0900 AEDT Sunday), will be the first test of the commitment by Kiev and pro-Russian separatists to the peace plan that was inked on Thursday in Minsk after marathon talks between Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nWith Kiev and Washington claiming Russia was spearheading a separatist push to conquer more territory and government forces digging in, there were fears over whether the truce would be observed at all, despite both sides pledging to honour the truce at the appointed time.\n\nOn Saturday, Putin re-affirmed his commitment to the ceasefire in a call with its diplomatic co-sponsors, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande.\n\nAccording to the French presidency, the three leaders, and Putin all confirmed \"the need for the ceasefire scheduled for midnight to be effective\".\n\n\"Putin said the rebels were ready for the ceasefire,\" it added.\n\nDonetsk rebel chief Alexander Zakharchenko - one of two leaders of rebel forces the West views as Russian puppets - earlier ordered his fighters respect the truce, but ward off any attacks \"with all force and means.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Zakharchenko also warned any attempts by Ukraine troops who have been encircled in Debaltseve to escape the city after the ceasefire takes hold will be viewed as an act of aggression, and violation of the truce.\n\nZakharchenko justified that position by noting \"there is not a word about Debaltseve in the Minsk accords.\"\n\nThe UN Security Council was meanwhile expected to meet on Sunday for an emergency session, diplomats said.\n\nThe United States said the Russian military had deployed large amounts of artillery and multiple rocket launcher systems and was using them to shell Ukrainian positions.\n\nThe fragile deal is seen as the best hope of ending the conflict, which has killed at least 5480 people and ratcheted East-West tensions to levels not seen since the Cold War.\n\nThe new Minsk agreement is broadly similar to an earlier failed deal in September and is fraught with potential pitfalls.\n\nBoth sides have to begin withdrawing heavy weapons from the frontline within two days of the start of the ceasefire to establish a buffer zone between 50 and 140 kilometres wide, depending on the range of the weapons.\n\nUnder the Minsk agreement, Kiev will also begin retaking control over the approximately 400-kilometre stretch of Russia's border with rebel-held Ukraine, but only after local elections are held.\n\nThe border is entirely under Russian and rebel control and is used, according to Kiev, as a conduit for separatist supplies.\n\nDo you have any news photos or videos?",

But using the program isn\u2019t quite as simple as just downloading and logging in \u2014 as we found out below.\n\nLike we said at the app\u2019s announcement, WeChat Enterprise includes a number of features that are familiar territory to those who have used business chat apps. But it also has some welcome innovations.\n\nThe service can essentially replace group email, and make quick chats between colleagues easier. It has useful add-ons like the ability for an employee to mark when they are on a break, hold group voice/text chats, and allows for companies to build in specific features like automated forms for reimbursements, vacations, and the like.\n\nThe service can essentially replace group email, and make quick chats between colleagues easier.\n\nEmployees can even make calls via WeChat Enterprise that are charged to their company\u2019s bill \u2014 an offer that we haven\u2019t seen in similar office chat programs.\n\nWeSlack (sorry, but that is a catchy name) also allows for users to embrace their less formal side, with support for the personal chat client\u2019s emoticons and animated stickers.\n\nAccording to a post on QQ Tech \u2014 a website owned by WeChat\u2019s parent company, Tencent \u2014 the service has been in a closed beta since early March.\n\nWhile Monday technically marks the service\u2019s launch, it\u2019s not quite as easy to use WeChat Enterprise as it is to start up a random Slack group. Companies that already have official business WeChat accounts (as many Chinese companies do) are already registered, and just need to go through a few steps on the WeChat Enterprise website.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a small startup \u2014 or not in China \u2014 you may be out of luck for now. To register on WeChat Enterprise, you need an official Chinese business license. There is no word on if/when the service will be available outside of the country.\n\nIf you work for a Chinese company and are determined to take WeChat Enterprise for a spin, now is the time to message your boss and tell them to register with Tencent. If they agree, then that may be one of the last work emails you\u2019ll need to send for a while.",

    "text": "Undoubtedly, as an entrepreneur, you\u2019re going to get a lot of advice from a multitude of sources\u2014friends, partners, mentors, and investors\u2014about what it takes to run a business. Some of it will be useful and some of it won\u2019t. Knowing who and what to listen to can be tricky not to mention overwhelming. I experienced this confusion firsthand while founding OpenTable, and I see how it affects the entrepreneurs I mentor today. So here\u2019s my best advice for navigating the information tug of war that inevitably happens when you start a business.\n\nIt\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint\n\nThe goal is to increase your chances of success. Being an entrepreneur is hard. It takes sacrifice. There are no overnight successes (well, maybe one or two), but for most successes out there, the real backstory is much more tumultuous. Success is almost never linear. Sometimes there are ups and downs, rights and lefts, forwards and backwards. OpenTable OPEN took 11 years to go public. The goal is to take one or two steps forward every day, with the understanding that there will be setbacks. My favorite analogy is comparing entrepreneurship to mountain climbing in Antarctica. Successful climbers don\u2019t dwell on the peak; they focus on the next 20 feet, and then the next, and then the next. Building a business takes time. You need to be able to weather the storms and take advantage of serendipity.\n\nThere\u2019s no such thing as an expert\n\nListen to what mentors have to say, but remember that you are the only one building this business at this particular point in time. No example before you is an exact replica of your business. And just because something worked in the past, or didn\u2019t work in the past, doesn\u2019t mean that it will or won\u2019t now. I don\u2019t believe in experts. The idea that anyone (including me) is an expert is silly. There are people that know more than others about a particular topic, but often times the mentors you will encounter have a worldview that fits a particular time and business in history. But once things change, their view, which used to be insightful, will likely be obsolete. To me, many \u201cexperts\u201d are a product of a time. With that said, there\u2019s obviously things you can learn from mentors, but their word is not gospel.\n\nDon\u2019t be a ping pong ball\n\nBe open to feedback. Learn, but don\u2019t be a ping pong ball. I prefer to work with entrepreneurs that have what I consider humble confidence. I like entrepreneurs that are somewhat self-effacing. They take feedback well and realize that while they are smart, they can\u2019t do it alone. (And that some luck plays into everything.) With that said, entrepreneurs must evoke confidence. Again, they take feedback well but don\u2019t bounce around on ideas. They have a point of view and they own. It\u2019s their unique take on the world, and they are building their business around it.\n\nGet out of the building\n\nAlways be action-oriented. Building a business isn\u2019t about sitting around a white board and hypothesizing about what customers might want and how to grow your business. It\u2019s about getting \u201cout of the building\u201d and interacting with customers. What do your customers actually want? How should you sell to them? If the problem or pain is big enough, they will buy an imperfect product. So get to a minimum viable product ASAP and find out who will pay and how much they will pay. Get your product into the wild and learn from your customers.\n\nI say this so often that one of Impact Engine\u2019s portfolio companies made me a shirt with this slogan on it. I like startups that are extremely focused on a single revenue model, a single customer segment, and a single solution, to start. Once you\u2019re bigger, you can divert resources to more than one initiative, but in the beginning, it should be all about figuring out your revenue model and growth model. How do you make money: revenue model. How do you scale that money: growth model. I\u2019ve seen several startups fail because they are trying to scale multiple sales models to multiple customer types.\n\nGet as many \u201cat bats\u201d as possible. Most entrepreneurial efforts fail. And most of your ideas will also fail. The best way to increase your chances of success is to be alive as long as possible. The best way to do that is to be frugal. Benjamin Franklin talked about being frugal and industrious. So be wise with your money, but not in a way that suffocates growth. The longer you can stretch your runway, the more chances you have at bat. And hopefully one of those chances leads to a hit. My friend and entrepreneur Chris Gladwin says it so well, \u201cto be in business you have to be in business.\u201d Once you have the revenue model and growth model figured out and there is arbitrage in the business, then you can invest aggressively. Businesses have a natural rate of growth that capital can help accelerate, but at some point the marginal capital is wasted and inefficient.\n\nBalance lean startup methodologies with being unreasonable. You have to be unbiased about your business. Do you really see it working? In orienteering, they call it \u201cbending the map.\u201d When you come upon a hill during a hike, you mark it with your compass to find it later. But when you try to find it on the map you get disoriented, and you trick yourself into believing that the hill you see on the map is also the hill you see in front of you. But deep down, you know that it\u2019s not. Entrepreneurs can get caught in that trap as well. They know something isn\u2019t right but they fool themselves into believing things are working. While you shouldn\u2019t give up on your dreams, you need to be incredibly honest with the results you are seeing and adjust accordingly.\n\nThink about the Adoption Curve (innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards). Look for the innovators in your space as the first (and possibly) most valuable customers. If their pain is big enough, they will take a suboptimal product, because for them, the problem is so painful that they need a solution immediately. They will be open and happy (for the short-term) with an MVP. They will also give you the benefit of the doubt as you continue to build out the product and bring on more (early adopters and early majority) customers. If you can\u2019t find any innovators or early adopters that will use your MVP, then you are probably not solving a real problem.\n\nLuck is always involved in entrepreneurship. No matter how hard you work, there will be some (good and bad) luck in it. Yes, luck favors the prepared and it is not all about luck. But when it comes along, recognize it and take advantage of it. And when you have bad luck, don\u2019t feel sorry for yourself. Embrace it and get back out there. There will be setbacks. The only question is: how will you respond? Will you sulk and think \u201cwhy me?\u201d or will you bounce back and find a way to persevere? And remember, luck goes both ways. So if something happens in your favor, be thankful and embrace it. And don\u2019t pat your back too hard or you may bruise yourself.\n\nThe buck stops with you\n\nThis is your company. Mentors and investors are here to help, but ultimately it is your business. If you want or need something, don\u2019t be afraid to ask your supporters for help. But remember, the buck stops with you.\n\nChuck Templeton is the founder of OpenTable. Templeton is currently the Chairman of Impact Engine, a startup accelerator helping for-profit businesses address societal and environmental problems.",

    "text": "Chefs who rode into town in pickup trucks filled with red beans and rice became instant heroes. When the bakery that makes the city\u2019s airy poor-boy loaves reopened, or beloved fried Hubig\u2019s Pies reappeared on shelves of convenience stores, the city celebrated with the enthusiasm of Carnival.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anything people notice here, it\u2019s restaurant reviews,\u201d said Byron Mouton, an architect who is a New Orleans native. \u201cThey\u2019ll turn to that before they turn to any political controversy in the paper.\u201d\n\nBrett Anderson, who began reviewing restaurants for the newspaper in 2000, returned to New Orleans a week after Hurricane Katrina and quickly shifted from critiquing restaurants to reporting on efforts to rebuild them. Mr. Anderson was part of an editorial team whose work covering post-hurricane New Orleans won the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for public service.\n\nLike other staff members, he proudly wore a T-shirt with the slogan, \u201cWe publish come hell and high water.\u201d\n\nBut not, it turned out, restaurant reviews.\n\n\u201cIf I started back pontificating about whether the pan\u00e9ed rabbit was up to snuff,\u201d Mr. Anderson said, \u201cI would have been missing the bigger story, which was about recovery.\u201d\n\nBesides, there was not much food to critique.\n\n\u201cWriting reviews of M.R.E.\u2019s would have been funny,\u201d Mr. Anderson said, \u201cbut the situation didn\u2019t really call for comedy.\u201d\n\nAs more restaurants opened, it became clear that if he resumed critiquing restaurants, he would have to take them to task for things that were arguably beyond their control, like poor service.\n\nFinding qualified workers is still the biggest headache for chefs in the New Orleans area, where there are about a third fewer residents than before the hurricane. In the second quarter of 2007, the restaurant job-vacancy rate was 13.4 percent; before the storm, it was 3.6 percent.\n\n\u201cHousing is surely a large part of this problem,\u201d said Allison Plyer, the deputy director of the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center.\n\nRent has jumped 46 percent since 2005, pricing out many people who once could live on restaurant wages.\n\nA lack of child care and public transportation has also hurt, Ms. Plyer said. The number of child-care centers has dropped by more than half. Only 21 percent of the city\u2019s public transit routes are in operation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for a sous-chef for six months,\u201d said Susan Spicer, the chef at Bayona in the French Quarter.\n\nBefore the storm, that section of town was considered the real moneymaker for restaurants, with a constant flow of tourists. But the buzz and the business, Ms. Spicer said, is now in neighborhoods that cater more to locals.\n\nFor his first review since the hurricane, Mr. Anderson selected Mr. B\u2019s Bistro in the French Quarter. The restaurant is part of the Brennan family empire that includes Commander\u2019s Palace. He gave it three beans out of a possible five. A previous critic had awarded four.\n\nHe chose the restaurant, which opened in 1979, in part because it had been gutted and rebuilt to look precisely as it did before Hurricane Katrina and because it serves classic New Orleans food like barbecued shrimp and bread pudding.\n\nA part owner, Ralph Brennan, said before he had read the review that the return of restaurant criticism in New Orleans was a good sign.\n\n\u201cThere are many, many steps to this recovery,\u201d Mr. Brennan said, \u201cand it\u2019s one more positive step.\u201d\n\nMr. Anderson said that he probably could have started publishing reviews last fall but that he had to take a family leave. \u201cThen Mardi Gras came and then Jazz Fest and, well, New Orleans being New Orleans, here we are in July,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, critics who waded in too early were swiftly vilified, something the GQ food writer Alan Richman discovered in November 2006.\n\nMr. Richman dissected the city\u2019s restaurants, arguing that food in New Orleans was never as good as its reputation. Even his positive praise was faint. \u201cI do admire much about the restaurants,\u201d he wrote, \u201ceven if their desserts survived Katrina because they were too heavy to float away.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour grandmother has a stroke, and then you\u2019re going to beat up on her because she doesn\u2019t make the gumbo as well as she used to?\u201d said Tom Fitzmorris, a longtime restaurant writer and radio host, who calls Mr. Richman\u2019s article despicable.\n\nMr. Fitzmorris keeps a citywide restaurant count that now totals 950, not including fast-food outlets, bars and most chains. When he started the tally, about a month after the storm, the number was 22.\n\nOther reviewers tried to step in to fill the void, notably writers for the paper Gambit Weekly. Naturally, in a city of strong opinions about food, several bloggers emerged as well. But, said Will Coviello, arts and entertainment editor of Gambit Weekly, \u201cI hesitate to say anyone distinguished themselves as credible.\u201d\n\nSome eaters believe the hurricane, for all the damage it did, provided a sort of culinary correction for restaurants that were either resting on their laurels or aping faddish dishes from New York and Los Angeles.\n\nJohn Besh, a chef often held up as an example of going far afield, has drawn in his focus and creates high-end food that pays renewed attention to Louisiana ingredients. Mr. Besh said he was looking forward to the return of Mr. Anderson\u2019s reviews.\n\n\u201cWe cooks love to wake up on Friday mornings and open up The Times-Picayune and learn what other people are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key thing is to stay competitive, and that\u2019s where the role of the critic comes in.\u201d\n\nEven the TV chef Emeril Lagasse, who was the target of an article by Mr. Anderson in the weeks after Hurricane Katrina that questioned why Mr. Lagasse had not yet visited the city that made him famous, is welcoming the reviews back \u2014 especially because rising fuel and food costs are adding to the headaches for a New Orleans restaurant owner.\n\n\u201cBusiness isn\u2019t flying off the charts yet, so any chance to show off what we do well is welcome,\u201d Mr. Lagasse said, adding that he and Mr. Anderson were now \u201ccool.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr. Anderson is happy to once again be handing out beans.\n\n\u201cI thought after the storm my job was going to be a never-ending series of stories about what great places were lost,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that never happened. I can count on one hand the great, significant, iconic restaurants that haven\u2019t reopened.\u201d",

    "text": "By agreeing to give the FAA flexibility in implementing the sequester, in response to the outcry over flight delays, Democrats effectively squandered their leverage in the sequester battle, by signaling that they will selectively undo its effects when the political going gets tough. Does that mean they\u2019ve lost the sequester fight completely?\n\nIn an interview this morning, Dem Rep. Chris Van Hollen \u2014 a top party strategist \u2014 was surprisingly frank in conceding that Dems had given away crucial leverage by agreeing to the FAA fix. But he said Dems could still make up some of that lost ground \u2014 and called on them not to agree to any more targeted sequester fixes.\n\n\u201cWe have certainly made it more difficult to stand firm going forward,\u201d Van Hollen told me. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have to reclaim some lost ground here. We cannot have a situation where people just cherry-pick the sequester.\u201d\n\nVan Hollen bluntly suggested that Dems \u2014 in agreeing to just a targeted FAA fix \u2014 had sent a message about Congress that it\u2019s only responsive to powerful interests.\n\n\u201cIf you do that, you\u2019re attacking the symptoms rather than the underlying cause,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cWhen you do that, what happens is the most politically strong groups with the most lobbyists get relief, at the expense of everybody else. Meals on Wheels, or kids on Head Start, or grants on biomedical research \u2014 all of those get left behind.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as the Huffington Post demonstrates, those cuts are really set to devastate programs like Meals on Wheels, causing a real human toll.\n\nIs it too late for Dems to change course? Now that Congress has proven itself willing to act to mitigate specific sequestration cuts, other special interest groups are gearing up to secure the same thing for themselves, which could result in the sequester getting undone piece by piece, while sequestration-level funding continues \u2013 a total defeat for Democrats.\n\nBut Van Hollen called on Dems to have a united front in this battle going forward, and said they should not agree to any more targeted fixes. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be voting for exceptions to this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to draw a line and say we\u2019ve got to deal with this in a comprehensive way, rather than play Whack-a-Mole.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d Van Hollen acknowledged, speaking of the pressure that will be brought to bear on Dems to agree to more targeted fixes. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s going to require a united position and leadership.\u201d\n\nAs Steve Benen, Ezra Klein and others have noted, by agreeing to the FAA fix, Democrats have effectively undermined their own hopes that the pain of sequestration will ever force Republicans back to the table. Van Hollen, for his part, holds an outside hope that if Dems maintain a united front, an eventual resolution is still conceivable.\n\n\u201cI think there are enough Republicans who recognize that permanent sequestration is bad for the country, that there will be an opportunity to replace some or all of the sequester,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t get that opportunity if we keep addressing this piecemeal.\u201d\n\nAnd even if Dems do hold firm \u2014 a pretty big \u201cif\u201d \u2014 the chances that the pain of sequestration will force Republicans back to the table to deal could be minimized by another factor: the looming debt ceiling fight. House GOP leaders \u2014 who have already openly admitted that they are not prepared to allow default \u2014 may be under pressure from the right to use the debt limit to extract spending cuts from Dems. If that happens, GOP leaders may need to be able to point to continued sequestration to mollify conservatives who will be spoiling for a debt limit battle, by citing it as proof that Republicans are winning the battle over spending cuts already. That\u2019s another incentive for them to stick with the sequester.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s looking more and more like we\u2019re stuck in extended sequestration. But, as Van Hollen says, Dems should at least try to unite and hold firm, anyway. Not least because failing to do so will again show that Congress is overly responsive to powerful special interests, even as the cuts continue to programs that help poor people without powerful lobbies on their side.",
    "summary": "The chances that Republicans can be forced back to the table to deal on the sequester appear minimal. But Dems should not agree to anymore piecemeal changes to it."

    "text": "The hashtag #TrumpWon was trending on Twitter Tuesday. Partially boosted by sarcasm, it was fuelled primarily by Donald Trump, who was quick to claim he won Monday's debate by citing a slew of online polls that pegged him as the winner.\n\nBut there's a problem. None of the polls Trump has pointed to are actually legitimate polls. Instead, all of the scientific, real polls published so far have shown him to be the loser of the debate by significant margins.\n\nIn the world of public opinion research, the \"online polls\" that litter news websites are a plague. Whereas real surveys try to assemble representative samples of the population, these online polls are more of a gimmick or a game. Anyone can answer them. Often people can answer them multiple times. They can invite their friends, who likely think just like them, to answer the online polls on social media.\n\nAnd then they can point to these completely unrepresentative and meaningless results as if they signal something important.\n\nAt their very best, these online polls are only a sample of a given website's audience \u2014 at least those who see the online poll while it is posted and are interested enough to participate. It is no coincidence that two of the online polls Trump has quoted come from conservative websites like Drudge and Breitbart (the latter run by Trump's campaign CEO).\n\nThese online polls are not the same as the legitimate surveys conducted by pollsters that sample from a demographically representative internet panel. And they are certainly not the same as the legitimate surveys that randomly sample from the general population via telephone.\n\nThese legitimate polls also differ in their results. Four scientific polls published since the debate using legitimate surveying methods have shown that debate-watchers saw Hillary Clinton as the better performer and the winner of Monday's debate:\n\nNevertheless, some of these legitimate polls still come with some caveats.\n\nThe Morning Consult poll, for instance, included voters who did not watch the debate.\n\nThe CNN/ORC poll has been criticized for having a slightly larger sample of Democrats than most surveys normally do. But the disproportionate presence of Democrats in the sample was not significant enough to put much of a dent in Clinton's 35-point lead over Trump. And it is impossible to know for certain whether or not the debate audience was disproportionately Democratic in the first place, or that the debate itself pushed more Americans to self-identify as Democrats.\n\nStill, the evidence gleaned from the scientific surveys shows that Clinton won the debate by a wide margin. The last time CNN recorded such a big win in a debate was in 2012, when Mitt Romney bested a tired-looking Barack Obama in that campaign's first tilt.\n\nRomney used that performance to close the gap on his rival, though his surge did not endure.\n\nWe won't know for certain what short-term impact the debate will have on the race for a few more days. A few surveys on voting intentions will trickle out for the rest of the week, but clear trend lines won't be clear until after the weekend.\n\nThe legitimate polls of debate-watchers, despite the clear victory for Clinton, do not necessarily suggest that she is likely to make significant gains. In a two-point race, though, she will gladly take insignificant gains.\n\nOn balance, the legitimate polls suggest that the debate may have made Americans slightly more likely to vote for Clinton than for Trump, though most of the enthusiasm for each candidate came from people who were already planning to vote for them. Nevertheless, both the CNN/ORC and PPP polls found that Clinton had done better among Independents than Trump did.\n\nAdditionally, the scientific polls found that Republicans were more likely to say Clinton had won than Democrats were to give the debate to Trump.\n\nSo Trump may have been scraping the bottom of the barrel in the public opinion world to find these online polls that suggested he had the better night. But that may not be the point. Most voters are unlikely to differentiate much between legitimate and illegitimate polls.\n\nIn the end, Trump's tweets and statements about the \"online polls\" that have shown him as the winner may not be for the consumption of the broader public, but instead to keep his own supporters motivated and optimistic about his campaign. In a post-truth political world, that may be good enough.",
    "summary": "Donald Trump has claimed victory in Monday's presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, using online \"polls\" as his evidence. The only problem is those polls are bunk, and the legitimate polls show Clinton won comfortably."

    "text": "EVEN though teen-agers are using contraception more conscientiously, increasing numbers are becoming pregnant because more are sexually active.\n\nThat was one of the primary findings of a report entitled ''Teenage Pregnancy: The Problem That Hasn't Gone Away,'' published yesterday by the Alan Guttmacher Institute. The report projected that 4 of every 10 girls aged 14 would become pregnant at least once during their teen-age years, 2 of 10 would give birth and more than 1 in 7 would have an abortion.\n\nThe report, a compilation of recent research, was designed by the institute, a Planned Parenthood affiliate specializing in research and education, as a sequel to a 1976 study, ''11 Million Teenagers: What Can be Done About the Epidemic of Adolescent Pregnancies in the United States.'' Richard Lincoln, senior vice president of the institute and author of the report, said it was an amalgam of ''probably 100 studies, each of which involved thousands of teen-agers.''\n\nThe assessment of adolescent sexuality was issued at a time of confusion and controversy over sex-related issues. Richard S. Schweiker, Secretary of Health and Human Services, has said that he supports a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would abolish abortion, that he believes that physicians should not be permitted to prescribe contraceptives to teen-age Medicaid patients and that he advocates a strong voice for parents in determining whether sex ought to be taught in school.\n\nHe has also said, ''I do not think the Federal Government should be in the sex education business.'' The appointment of Marjorie Mecklenburg to head the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs, a department branch that provides funds for teen-age mothers and counsels them on the prevention of subsequent pregnancies, is expected soon. Mrs. Mecklenburg is president of the American Citizens Concerned for Life, an organization opposed to abortion. One contention of the report is that the availability of abortion and contraception have helped reduce births among teen-agers.\n\nThe report appears to offer little evidence that the problem is ''going away,'' for with more teen-agers becoming sexually active, more of them are becoming pregnant despite an overall decline in the rate at which teen-agers are having babies.\n\nOf the 29 million people aged 13 to 19, 12 million - 7 million boys and 5 million girls - have had sexual intercourse, according to the survey statistics.\n\nThe report estimates that the number of sexually active teen-agers increased by two-thirds in the 1970's, a figure that, while considered reliable, is approximate because it is based on a series of studies of girls in metropolitan areas conducted in 1971, 1976 and 1979. A similar survey of boys was conducted only in 1979, so there is no basis for comparison.\n\n''The increase was most dramatic among whites - especially those aged 15-17, whose rate of sexual activity doubled,'' the report says. ''Between the middle of the decade and the end, the increase in teenage sexual activity was entirely accounted for by unmarried whites. Although, age for age, the proportion of black teen-agers who are sexually active continues to be higher than that of whites, the gap between them has closed considerably.\n\nThe report continues: ''In the early 1970's, race, socio-economic status, residence and religious affiliation were all related to age at first intercourse. But many of these distinctions are beginning to disappear as premarital sexual activity increases among all elements of the teen-age population. ''\n\nThe average age at the time of first sexual experience is 16. By the time age 19 is reached, only a fifth of the males and a third of the females have not had intercourse. Social, economic and religious factors no longer seem to be deterrents, according to the report.\n\nWhat does matter in consideration of pregnancy is the fact of youth itself: While teen-agers constitute only 18 percent of sexually active women considered capable of becoming pregnant, they account for 46 percent of out-of-wedlock births and 31 percent of abortions.\n\nAlthough the pregnancy rate is rising, a smaller proportion of teen-age girls are giving birth - with the exception of those under 15, whose rate has remained stable in recent years. Despite the decline, which is attributed to use of contraception and abortion, the American birthrate is still one of the highest in the world. In 1978 there were 1,142,000 pregnancies and 554,000 births among teenagers, 17 percent of them conceived after marriage. Thirty-eight percent of the pregnancies were terminated by abortion, 22 percent resulted in out-of-wedlock births and the rest were miscarried.\n\nThe findings on birth control among adolescents exemplify the partly hopeful, partly alarming picture drawn by the report. On the one hand, the level and consistency of contraceptive use increased impressively during the 1970's: 7 in 10 teen-agers questioned in 1979 said they had taken precautions at the last instance of intercourse, compared with 6 in 10 in 1976 and 5 in 10 in 1971. Just 27 percent of the sexually active teen-agers reported in 1979 that they had never used a birth control method.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly two-thirds of teen-age women said that either they never used contraception or did so erratically. Asked why they had failed to do so, 4l percent of the group said they were convinced they would not become pregnant because their encounters occurred at the wrong time of the month.\n\nTeen-agers who use contraceptive devices tend to wait until they have been sexually active about nine months, the report said. That delay often proves risky: more than half the pregnancies were conceived within six months of the first act of intercourse and a fifth during the first month.\n\nThe choice of specific birth-control methods changed markedly during the decade. The proportion of teen-agers using methods judged medically most effective - the pill and the intrauterine device - almost doubled between 1971 and 1976 but declined by 8 percent at the end of the decade, probably because of publicity about adverse effects. In comparison, the proportion of teen-agers using the least reliable method - withdrawal - declined about 16 percent between 1971 and 1976 and then increased by 46 percent between 1976 and 1979.\n\nThe number of abortions performed on teen-agers in 1978, 434,000, was almost double those in 1973 - 246,000. Teen-agers accounted for 3 of every 10 abortions in the 1970's.\n\nHowever, the report said that in 1978 ''about 3 in 10 of the teenagers estimated to want and need abortion services were unable to obtain abortions -a total of 160,000 teen-agers who, as a result, had unintended births.'' It said these represented about 60 percent of unintended births among teen-agers.\n\nDiscussing preventive measures, Mr. Lincoln said, ''Highest priority ought to go to preventive services to reach teen-agers before they become sexually active, certainly by junior high school, and the development of contraceptive methods that are appropriate to the episodic relationships of teen-agers.''",

Only 30 percent of the respondents in Allianz\u2019s survey chose financial fitness as a top goal for 2015.\n\nBoth companies surmise that Americans are more confident about their financial situations, so they aren\u2019t feeling the pressure to focus on finances.\n\nThe economy is healthier. Interest rates are still super low.\n\nThe percentage of people saying now is a good time to find a quality job jumped to 36 percent in December, a long way up from the 8 percent level of confidence that Americans had in the job market in November 2011, according to Gallup.\n\nAnd the stock market has been roaring, boosting investment portfolios and in many cases erasing the losses suffered during the Great Recession.\n\nWhile certainly one\u2019s health is important \u2014 I know I\u2019m promising myself to get more sleep and exercise \u2014 financial well-being is equally vital.\n\nBut we can\u2019t forget the past.

After you do this checkup, you\u2019ll know what, if anything, you\u2019ll need to do to improve your financial situation.\n\nSo, when was the last time you calculated your net worth?\n\nIt is different from your income. There are a lot of pretenders, people who appear rich but are really paupers because they have a negative net worth. Net worth is the difference between your total assets and liabilities or, simply put, what you owe minus what you own. The more you own, the larger your net worth.\n\nThere is a huge gap between the net worth of upper-income Americans and families who are either middle- income or lower- income, according to findings by the Pew Research Center. It\u2019s the widest wealth gap in 30 years, Pew notes.\n\nIn 2013, upper-income families had $639,400 in net worth, on average, compared to $96,500 for middle-income families and $9,300 for lower-income families.\n\nNet worth \u201cis an important dimension of household well-being because it\u2019s a measure of a family\u2019s nest egg and can be used to sustain consumption during emergencies (for example, job layoffs) as well as provide income during retirement,\u201d wrote the Pew researchers Richard Fry and Rakesh Kochhar.\n\nAlthough the recession pushed down the net worth of upper-middle-income families, they\u2019ve seen their wealth double since 2003, according to Pew.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said of so many other families.\n\n\u201cThe Great Recession destroyed a significant amount of middle-income and lower-income families\u2019 wealth, and the economic \u2018recovery\u2019 has yet to be felt for them. Without any palpable increase in their wealth since 2010, middle- and lower-income families\u2019 wealth levels in 2013 are comparable to where they were in the early 1990s,\u201d wrote Fry, a senior research associate at Pew\u2019s Hispanic Trends Project, and Kochhar, the associate director for research at Pew.\n\nBankrate.com has an online net worth calculator that\u2019s nicely organized and does the math for you. There are a lot of things I like about the calculator. It explains the various items that go on the asset and liabilities side of your net worth statement. It can estimate how much your assets might change in value over 10 years by allowing you to select an average annual rate of increase \u2014 or decrease, if you know you\u2019ll be taking on some debt in the near future.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to estimate the value of household assets. For your major assets, such as your automobiles and home, you\u2019ll have to find out the current market values. For your home, try Zillow.com or Realtor.com. For your car, there are a number of online resources \u2014 Consumer Reports, Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, AutoTrader, and CarGurus \u2014 to help determine how much you could get for your vehicle.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve calculated your net worth, you have a starting point to see how you\u2019re doing. If you want a comparison with others at your age or income level, use CNNMoney\u2019s calculator at http://cnnmon.ie/1B5JYW6.\n\nAlthough you shouldn\u2019t be in competition with others, if you don\u2019t like your net worth figure, make some changes. And those changes can start with making some financial resolutions for the new year.",

    "text": "The low-slung structure tucked among the unearthly boulders of Joshua Tree looks vaguely like many other modern prefab homes from the last decade \u2014 streamlined silhouette, eco-chic materials, indoor-outdoor appeal \u2014 but with one key difference. It has Mickey Mouse in its corner.\n\nA globe-eared, white-gloved figurine sitting in the front window is the first \u2014 and during a recent sneak peek, the only \u2014 hint the owner is Tim Disney, great-nephew of Walt and a prefab believer. Disney is a board member and investor in prefab builder Blu Homes, and the Joshua Tree house, to be opened to the public for the first time next weekend, is Blu's first in Southern California. It's also part of the company's national push to fulfill prefab's decades-long promise of modern, efficient, affordable houses for the masses.\n\nMany have tried before. A line of prefab houses branded with the Dwell name and promoted in the popular magazine stopped production in 2008. Michelle Kaufmann, a well-regarded Bay Area architect whose smart designs have been used as Sunset magazine show houses, shut down her prefab business in 2009. Others who have stayed in the prefab game have been largely focused on the high end of the market \u2014 prefab houses that are so large and so highly customized, they cost as much as architect-designed dream homes.\n\n\"It's a great idea that's been around for a long time, but no one has really cracked it,\" Disney said.\n\nBut with the housing market showing inklings of a recovery, earlier this year The Times reported on another prefab design: the C6, touted as an affordable modern offering from the Santa Monica company LivingHomes. For its part, Blu Homes has moved its manufacturing facility from Massachusetts to Vallejo, Calif., and raised $37.5 million in capital investment to continue preaching the prefab gospel.\n\nHouses constructed in a factory, transported by truck, craned into place and bolted together have long promised reduced construction waste, faster completion time, better quality control and limited exposure to the elements (and thus less threat of mold and weather-weakened materials). What has changed to make Disney believe that Blu can succeed in a way that others have not?\n\n\"The downturn in the market created opportunity,\" Disney said, adding that a backlash against overly large, inefficient and costly McMansions has spurred many people to consider the merits of more modest, scaled-down, efficient homes.\n\n\"There are all sorts of sociological studies that show people don't feel comfortable in big open spaces,\" he said, laughing. \"Seriously, it's more rational to live in manageable spaces \u2014 less distance to walk from room to room, less cleaning, less energy. It just makes more sense.\"\n\nThe Joshua Tree house also stands apart in that it's built of steel-framed modules that can fold for transport and unfold on site. The proprietary design means the company can expand the envelope of the building, allowing for wider and taller rooms to be transported on standard shipping-container trucks.\n\n\"The ceiling height is substantially higher, and there are a lot of windows, so it feels large, bright and airy,\" Disney said. \"The Blu homes are relatively small, but the ceiling height changes one's perception of space.\"\n\nBlu has seven architectural models, each available in different sizes and configurations, with a palette of fixtures and finishes. Prices for design consultation, construction and installation start at $125,000 for a 450-square-foot studio with fully equipped kitchen and bathroom, and rise to more than $500,000 for a 2,700-square-foot house with four bedrooms and three bathrooms \u2014 fixtures and appliances included.\n\nThe Joshua Tree house won't be for everyone. It uses Blu Homes' most modest modules, 18-foot-wide boxes with tight bedrooms and even tighter bathrooms.\n\nBut during a walk-through last week, Blu Homes West Coast Project Manager Jeffrey Morter pointed out features that might appeal to the modern home buyer: abundant windows connecting to the landscape, glass doors equipped with sliding cedar-slat shades, radiant-heat bamboo flooring, ash kitchen cabinetry.\n\nWhat may finally sell prospective buyers, a Blu spokeswoman said, is fixed pricing. Whereas traditional construction takes three times as long and costs twice as much as originally expected, the adage goes, Blu prefab buyers are quoted a number that won't change. Construction cost overruns, she said, are extremely rare when building in a controlled environment with set materials and work crew.\n\nThose who head out to the high desert for a peek may be intrigued not only by the house but also by its site in Joshua Tree. \"It's this amazing combination of extremely remote and yet accessible,\" Disney said \u2014 a seemingly unattainable combination that echoes the challenges of prefab itself.",

According to advocates and local media, the discovery was made more than 100 miles from Walker\u2019s home in Salisbury, North Carolina.\n\nA Latin Kings gang member, Angel Dejesus Arias, 23, was arrested and charged with killing Walker and stealing her car, reports said on Thursday. He was being held without bond.\n\nAmid reports from Detroit, Texas and Phoenix of the deaths of three more black, transgender women, some observers have placed the number of transgender women killed this year at 16.\n\nIn a statement, transgender Human Rights Campaign staff member Laya Monarez said: \u201cEven as we are seeing an increase in transgender visibility through a range of inspiring national media stories, including Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s, the levels of violence and harassment transgender people face \u2013 particularly transgender women and transgender women of color \u2013 constitute a national crisis.\u201d\n\nThis week, Texas police announced an investigation into the death of 22-year-old Shade Schuler, whose body was found badly decomposed in a field in Dallas. It took almost three weeks to identify her remains.\n\nActivists in Michigan were also asking for help from Detroit law enforcement, after 20-year-old Amber Monroe was shot and killed in a city park. She was the fifth transgender woman to be killed in Palmer Park since 2014.\n\nIn Phoenix on Tuesday night a 35-year-old transgender woman, Kandis Capri, was shot dead.\n\nWalker was reported missing in November 2014, after her family had not heard from her since 24 October, the Salisbury Post reported. Police gave local media information about Walker\u2019s disappearance in an effort to generate leads, but few were forthcoming until Walker\u2019s burnt-out 2000 Pontiac Sunfire was discovered in an open field in Sampson County, police said in a release.\n\nArias had lived in a house in Salisbury that Walker was known to frequent, before moving to Johnston County, more than 100 miles away, where he was arrested on unrelated drug charges. Rowan County police obtained a search warrant for a Johnston County house, they said. They discovered Walker\u2019s body in a \u201csmall depression\u201d behind it.\n\nArias will not face hate crimes charges over Walker\u2019s death.

The department did not return a request for comment.\n\nCondolences for those close to Walker poured on to her Facebook page late this week, after news of Arias\u2019 arrest broke in the local community. Those posting to the page described Walker as joyful.\n\n\u201cMy heart hurts because you were such a kind spirit that never bothered anyone,\u201d said one poster, named as Fab Oz, on the page.\n\n\u201cYou always kept a smile on your face regardless of how you felt.

    "text": "This article is a section of a longer paper on Direct Primary Care (DPC) that was introduced in an earlier piece \u2014 Health Plan Rorschach Test: Direct Primary Care. The following excerpt from that article briefly explains DPC if it\u2019s a new concept. Click through the previous link for additional context.\n\nDespite its inclusion in Obamacare, Direct Primary Care (DPC, aka Concierge Medicine for the Masses), it\u2019s surprising how few health insurance executives know about DPC. DPC is a model of paying for primary care outside of insurance. The individual or organization paying for healthcare pays a monthly fee (like a gym membership) for all primary care needs. Generally, DPC providers say they can address 80 or more of the top 100 most common diagnoses.\n\n[Contact me via LinkedIn if you'd like a copy of the full seminal study on the Direct Primary Care model - excerpts will be published on Forbes]\n\nThe core value proposition DPC leaders describe is the gains from reducing administrative burdens while simultaneously delivering a more proactive model of care that leads to reductions in unnecessary downstream spending. Overall, primary care practices receive less than 5% of total healthcare spending. Buying into DPC results in a doubling of primary care spending. The argument is that by increasing primary care spending to about 10% of total health care costs, they can reduce downstream spending by more than this increment. That is, by helping their patients spend the rest of their healthcare dollar better, and by keeping them out of the expensive parts of the health care system \u2014 namely ERs, specialist offices, and hospitals. This isn\u2019t done by the old gatekeeper model. Rather, patients generally have less need for the more expensive facets of healthcare or they choose not to pursue them when fully informed.\n\nOne example of how DPC can be more proactive is typically DPC practitioners develop schedules of preventive screening and regular check-ins that they manage. This is in contrast to a typical primary care practice that responds when patients present themselves. In the section entitled \u201cDPC and the Healthcare Delivery System\u201d the details on cost savings and health improvements are provided.\n\nQliance projected the cost savings to the entire healthcare system if their model was replicated would be $268 billion[i] ($864/person-yr x 310 million people). The breakdown of the monthly costs change was as follows:\n\nValue Proposition The value proposition for the emerging DPC industry as a whole is that if it was scaled nationally, overall healthcare costs could be reduced 20-30%. That is, not just slowing healthcare inflation but reversing it. Qliance has shown they can reduce utilization 40-80% on the most expensive facets of healthcare as demonstrated in the graphic below.\n\nIora Health has been able to show dramatic decreases in downstream costs for patients in their practices, mainly due to reduced hospitalization, ER rates, and specialty related outpatient costs. An independent academic reviewer looked at claims data and found that patients in a direct primary care practice working with a large union trust in Atlantic City NJ had 25% lower outpatient utilization, 48% less ER visits, and 41% fewer hospital admissions than patients in a matched control group. This translated into a 12.3% net lower total cost of care, even after taking into account the higher primary care costs than in usual practices.\n\nIn addition Iora has shown that this sort of practice model can increase productivity \u2014 using a subset of the WPSI (Work productivity Short Inventory) survey, patients reported much less absenteeism (losing time from work) as well as presenteeism (being at work but not being as productive as possible) while in the DPC practice.\n\nSaving Patients Money in Their Use of the Healthcare System Typically, a high percentage of DPC consumers are either uninsured or have high-deductible plans. As a byproduct, they often seek guidance from DPC practitioners to keep their costs low. Often, the DPC provider knows which specialty practices have equal or better quality while offering dramatic savings off of the \u201cretail\u201d price. There are many examples of DPC practices that know high quality specialists such as radiologists who will gladly discount 80% or more for immediate payment and avoidance of the costs of billing and collections. For instance, Qliance immediately pays a top healthcare provider in Seattle $17 for X-ray reviews which is a huge discount over their retail price.\n\nDPC practitioners have the benefit of more time with patients, due to smaller panel sizes, to hear their story and fully discuss the trade-offs of particular screenings, treatments, and procedures. With the smaller panel size, DPC practitioners universally advertise their \u201cunrushed 30-minute appointments\u201d allowing for deeper dialogue with a patient that can be pivotal. For example, many people aren\u2019t aware of the overuse of CT scans that can lead to unnecessary exposure to radiation. One example illustrates this. A DPC physician described how in their previous practice pattern, when seeing a patient with constant migraines one would quickly order a CT scan at considerable cost. However, during the longer conversation enabled by the DPC model, the individual shared how her mother-in-law had recently moved in with her family. Long story short, the physician \u201cprescribed\u201d creating some boundaries, spending time meditating and going for walks as a means of taking a break. The patient followed the advice and the migraines went away. The result: a couple thousand dollars were saved and unnecessary radiation avoided.\n\nThe table below includes a list of services included in the scope of DPC practices. As there isn\u2019t a financial incentive to rapidly refer care to specialists, the scope of care can be broader than a typical primary care practice (e.g., some DPC practices provide x-rays and EKGs that would generally be referred outside of an insurance-based primary care practice). Similar to Patient-centered Medical Homes, coordination of care distinguishes DPC from most primary care practices. Some of those items may be outside of the scope of the membership fee, however they are generally offered at a modest cost. Following each item listed is whether the service is typically offered in some, most, or all of the dozen plus DPC interviewed for this paper.\n\nNear-site clinics Note: Onsite and near-site clinics could be a topic for an entire paper, however near site clinics are addressed because some DPC practices such as Paladina Health also provide near-site clinics. Onsite workplace clinics have proven to be attractive for some larger employers. The benefits of greater access to primary care and the time savings and convenience for employees have been irresistible. However, one must have a critical mass of employees in one location for it to make economic sense. Consequently, a related phenomenon has been a hybrid of DPC and onsite clinics. Clinics are located near a set of organizations, but not at a worksite \u2014 thus, the term \u201cnear site clinic.\u201d Iora Health, based in Boston, is one of the pioneers of this model. They have had particular success with unions, such as UNITEHere, which represents casino workers in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, and the Freelancer\u2019s Union that represents freelancers in Brooklyn. Like DPC, near-site clinics avoid the complexity and overhead of insurance.\n\nNear-site clinics also require a critical mass of employees or union members to pencil out. Relative to insurance-based primary care, the economics can be extremely attractive (see Iora Health profile for further detail). Nonetheless, if the employer/union isn\u2019t funding the build out, startup costs easily can run well into six figures. In these cases, DPC can be a more attractive option as the union, for instance, is only paying for those employees who are signed up; they pay on a per member, per month basis rather than being responsible for the full cost of the near -site clinic.\n\nPricing for Direct Primary Care\n\nBased on our study of DPC practices, typical pricing ranges from $20 with higher per-visit fees to the upper threshold of $100, which typically includes a broader array of services. An employer, union or individual paying the monthly membership fee views the investment in primary care coverage rather than a \u201cfee for service\u201d transaction between patient and provider as prudent. There is a wide array of pricing and a great deal of experimentation taking place in DPC, as one would expect in an evolving market. The variety of pricing models also reflects the regulatory environment under which DPC practices operate. For example, where there is DPC legislation (Oregon, Utah, Washington), the DPC organization doesn\u2019t have to do gyrations to avoid looking like insurance. For example, some practices charge a nominal per visit fee and bill after the end of the month as a means of avoiding the appearance of being classified as insurance and the accompanying reserve requirements and insurance regulations.\n\nThe following are the pricing themes common to all DPC practices studied:\n\nDPC practices typically recommend that members also obtain a high deductible wraparound policy to cover emergencies and catastrophic events. To date, patients have simply acquired regular high deductible policies not specifically designed to be paired with DPC. In addition, many have arrangements for services the DPC plan doesn\u2019t cover at a substantial discount (e.g., $400 for an MRI where the advertised rate or \u201crack rate\u201d for that same facility is $4000).\n\nNote: Subsequent to the publication of this paper, a major development for DPC is the availability of a high-deductible wraparound policy which addresses the top obstacle to DPC scaling nationally in the past. I learned of this recently and expect a public pronouncement this Summer. Some DPC providers are creating networks to broaden the scope of their reach.\n\nFFS cost data from seven large self-funded groups. Includes both employer and employee payments.

    "text": "A family watching television in their home, circa 1955. The channels we've always known are the perfect interface for TV.\n\n(CNN) -- \"Smart\" TVs have failed because they've always assumed more is better. Instead of evolving the television experience, TV makers have simply added to it, heaping more streams, more services, and more content onto our sets without rethinking the interfaces for accessing them.\n\nThe same problem plagues the services that power those smart TVs. Netflix offers thousands of options for what to watch, but instead of giving you a chance to skip through and sample them, it makes you evaluate each one, like a title on a video-store shelf.\n\nIn both cases, the experience has become more about selecting a piece of content than simply watching TV. The result? More ends up feeling like a lot less.\n\nThat's the central problem plaguing both set-top boxes like Roku and Apple TV and content services like Netflix and Amazon Instant Video. Instead of letting you lean back and soak up content, these new challengers require decisions -- a careful cost-benefit analysis of thousands of different options.\n\nIf the traditional TV experience is about letting viewers surf channels, today's on-demand video is like giving them a speedboat and forcing them choose a destination before they can even get in the water.\n\nIt's the fundamental reason smart TV and streaming video user interfaces pale in comparison to regular TV for so much of our daily viewing. And it's a shame.\n\nThe channels we've always known are the perfect interface for TV. For some reason, we seem hell-bent on abandoning them.\n\nThe simple joy of channel surfing\n\nChannel surfing sounds like a '90s relic, something we did when we were a nation of mindless couch potatoes, not yet graced with on-demand content and our sophisticated second screens.\n\nHere's the thing, though: We're still couch potatoes! According to the U.S. labor department, Americans on average watch nearly three hours of TV a day. Nielsen pegs it even higher, at 42 hours a week, with only three of those hours happening on laptops or mobile devices.\n\nHow a math genius hacked OkCupid to find true love\n\nIt's hard to find data that breaks down what we're watching, but I'll bet only a fraction is spent digesting hour-long cable dramas. That daily figure isn't so high because we're tuning in to must-see TV\u2014rather, it's the opposite. We get home and we flip on the set. We change into comfortable clothes, drink a glass of wine, make dinner, surf the web a little bit from a couch.\n\nIn between all those things we click around from channel to channel to find something to fill the air. It doesn't have to be riveting. Often times, it's better if it's not. What regular TV really offers is low-stakes, ambient entertainment.\n\nThat's something that's utterly missing from Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Roku, and Apple TV. Consider, for example, a strange paradox of the streaming video age: You'll totally watch an hour of \"Ghostbusters\" on TNT, but you'd never in a million years start it up from the top on Netflix, even though it's always right there, just a dozen clicks away.\n\nFacebook's greatest innovations: The first decade\n\nThat example gets to the heart of what makes channel surfing so great. It's a zero-commitment affair. It's a fundamentally passive way to consume media, whereas today's streaming video libraries demand agency on the part of the viewer. Netflix is great when you want to watch something, but it's terrible when you want to watch anything.\n\nSet-top boxes take too many clicks\n\nConsider how much friction there is in using today's streaming services, purely on a nuts-and-bolts level. With regular TV, you press one button and something's on your screen. Mash on the remote again and there's another show in front of you.\n\nChannel surfing is beautifully elegant in terms of input and output: a pure one-to-one relationship between tactile action and visual stimulus.\n\nCompare that to Apple TV. One click on the slippery little remote to wake it up; several more to navigate the grid-based UI to the \"channel\" of your choice. Even with the fistful of live TV apps now available on the device, the experience has none of the fluidity of real TV.\n\nSay you want to see what's on Watch ESPN. You have to click its icon, then navigate a sub-menu of ESPN's various channels. It doesn't show you what's on any of them. You just have to click into ESPN, see what's on, click back, then click ESPN 2, and so forth. It's maddening.\n\nNetflix needs to be a stream, not just a library\n\nWhen compared to the rest of our media diet, though, the bigger problems with streaming services such as Netflix quickly come into focus. As we've heard again and again, the dominant model for organizing digital content throughout the last half-decade has been the stream.\n\nIt's everywhere -- any site or service that presents content in the familiar, endlessly scrolling chronological list. Blogs are streams. Facebook's a stream. Twitter's a stream on steroids.\n\nYou know what else is a stream? Live TV! It comes with the very same qualities that exist in and enliven all the examples above. It's immediate. It's constant. It's always-on, always-there, always-new. You don't have to do a damn thing except show up.\n\nHow the NSA almost killed the Internet\n\nWhile synonymous with the age of streaming video, Netflix is less like a stream and more like a colossal vending machine. It offers a plentitude of carefully wrapped choices, each requiring careful consideration. Infinite choice is exhausting. Ask anyone who's spent 30 minutes trying to pick a movie, only to give up and see what's on TV.\n\nNate Giraitis, Associate Director, Insights & Strategy at Smart Design, points out that Netflix is very much defined by its origins. In its earliest incarnation, Netflix wasn't competing with TV; it was competing with Blockbuster.\n\n\"Netflix was a video rental store,\" he explains. \"And its original website was a rental shelf.\" That's what gave birth to Netflix's UI, and countless streaming video services have followed its example. As he puts it, with Netflix \"you're not watching. You're shopping.\"\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is trying to do better. It recently tweaked its UI so that the next episode of a TV series starts automatically after you finish one, simulating the always-something-on-next effect of regular TV.\n\nFelix Salmon recently argued that Netflix's new super-specific, algorithmically suggested microgenres are an effort to make itself more TV-like, an attempt to serve up something from its vast archive of second-tier content that you'll consent to watch, even if you're not enthralled by it.\n\nBut for Netflix and its ilk to begin eating into those three hours of nightly TV time, it needs proper channels. Think: A dozen programmed line-ups and an interface to match, so that with one click you can be in the middle of something random from Netflix's catalog -- something that's perfectly suited for the ambient entertainment we crave. If that's too radical, just think of it as Pandora-mode. It doesn't have to replace Netflix's library entirely. But it should be offered as a complement to it.\n\n11 must-watch Netflix movies to stream in 2014\n\nThe same goes for Roku TV. The company's newest product -- a flatscreen built from the ground up around Roku -- offers 1,200 \"channels,\" from real stations like PBS and ESPN, to services like Pandora and Netflix and lesser-known entities like Crackle and \"The Daily Burn.\"\n\nThere's one big problem. They're not really channels at all. Instead, they're just apps by another name. Make them into real, instantaneous video streams, and then you've got something.\n\nThere might be some dumb reason we can't have this. Perhaps there's a clause in licensing agreements that forbids Netflix from packaging this sort of programming; maybe most viewers don't yet have the bandwidth necessary for these services to simulate some sort of channel surfing experience.\n\nNevertheless, if Netflix truly wants to make itself an indispensable eight-bucks-a-month expense -- or if Roku wants to build the standalone TV that can finally break cable's hegemony -- giving couch potatoes some true channels to dip into is the way to do it.\n\nI could be wrong, but I suspect there are a lot of people like me out there. I never have time for \"Ghostbusters,\" but I always have time for the last 30 minutes of it.\n\nYou can build this open-source car in an hour\n\nSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

    "text": "Grumpy Cat does not approve of these coffee beans. (GrumpyCat.com)\n\nWith millions of dollars in the bank, Grumpy Cat shouldn\u2019t have much too frown about these days.\n\nBut it turns out the famous feline\u2019s legal team won\u2019t stand for any merchandising deals gone awry. Now they\u2019re involved in a legal dispute with a beverage company.\n\nIn 2013, Grumpy Cat Ltd, the Ohio-based company that owns the rights to the cat\u2019s (real name: Tardar Sauce) likeness gave Grenade Beverage the right to use the cat\u2019s name and image on \u201ca line of Grumpy Cat-branded coffee products,\u201d in exchange for royalties and a cash advance. According to the lawsuit filed before a U.S. District Court in California on Friday, the original agreement allowed the beverage company to create a drink called \u201cGrumpy Cat Grumppuccino,\u201d and any products beyond that, would require further negotiations with, and approval from, Grumpy Cat Ltd.\n\nBut apparently, Grenade has overstepped the boundaries of said agreement by distributing other Grumpy Cat branded products in the form of several varieties of roast coffee beans. Before filing a lawsuit, Grumpy Cat Ltd repeatedly told Grenade not to move forward with the production and distribution of the new Grumpy Cat branded coffee beans, reports Consumerist.\n\n\u201cYou are not authorized to proceed with the ground coffee product, and your posting of these products for sale will constitute a clear breach of the subject licensing agreement,\u201d reads a Nov. 24 e-mail to Grenade noted in the complaint. \u201cDo NOT proceed with the posting of the ground coffee products.\u201d\n\nGrenade ignored warnings and began advertising the coffee beans online last month. As of now, they are available to purchase on GrumpyCat.com\u2014which, somewhat confusingly, is owned by Grenade and not Grumpy Cat Ltd. The plaintiffs are also demanding that the defendant immediately transfer and turn over rights to the \u201cinfringing website.\u201d\n\n\u201cIronically, while the world-famous feline Grumpy Cat and her valuable brand are most often invoked in a tongue-and-cheek fashion, Defendants\u2019 despicable misconduct here has actually given Grumpy Cat and her owners something to be grumpy about,\u201d reads the beginning the lawsuit.\n\nGrumpy Cat Ltd has also accused Grenade of selling unauthorized T-shirts with Tardar Sauce\u2019s likeness and \u201cfailing to provide accurate and timely accounting of sales and royalties.\u201d They seeking damages \"proximately caused by the defendants' unlawful use of the domain name, or, in the alternative, statutory damages of $100,000.\" Grumpy Cat is also requesting a jury trial.\n\nWhen contacted by Eater, Paul Sandford, a partner in Grenade and a named defendant in the lawsuit, denied any wrongdoing on his brand\u2019s part. \"Can't comment other than to say there isn't a single factual allegation contained in the entire complaint, not one,\" Sandford told Eater via email. \"Stay tuned.\"",

    "text": "He has \u201cendearing\u201d down, but that\u2019s not enough to make a character fully human. In awful, gushy films like \u201cSpanglish\u201d (2004) and \u201cClick\u201d (2006), he works so hard at playing the husband and dad that he almost loses the average Joe quality. And Mike Binder, the writer and director of \u201cReign Over Me,\u201d has invented a character who seems artificial from the start, a man who responds to the loss of his wife and three daughters in the terrorist attack by shutting out the world and zooming around New York on a small motorized scooter while playing \u201980s music on enormous headphones. There\u2019s not much any actor can do with that, or with the self-importance of a script that sees mourning and strained zaniness as a good match.\n\nAs Charlie in \u201cReign Over Me\u201d Mr. Sandler uses the same mumbly delivery and stony face he used as Barry in \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d (a lesser film by the first-rate writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson). Barry occasionally erupts in anger, and Charlie eventually erupts in a flood of memories and grief (the obligatory crying scene), but they might as well be the same guy with different haircuts. Sometimes in \u201cReign\u201d it seems that Mr. Sandler is looking blank to play off his doofus image; more often that stony face seems to be the only way he can act a serious role. He is not walking that tightrope between the familiar Adam Sandler and someone fresh.\n\nThe most successful comedians going for drama know that a movie doesn\u2019t have to be about Sept. 11 or the Holocaust to be serious and touching. One of last year\u2019s most affecting performances was Mr. Ferrell\u2019s in the fantasy \u201cStranger Than Fiction,\u201d as Harold Crick, an I.R.S. agent who hears a woman\u2019s voice narrating his life. He discovers he is the hero of a novel-in-progress whose author (Emma Thompson) intends to kill him just as soon as she gets past her writer\u2019s block.\n\nGiven this supremely unrealistic premise, Mr. Ferrell makes Harold a sweet, believable, heart-tugging guy. His face is often still, but you can see the thoughtfulness in his eyes. His small facial expressions and underplayed delivery become extremely funny as he registers surprise at the absurdity of his situation, then quiet, quizzical acceptance. Hilarious when being grilled by Dustin Hoffman, as a literature professor trying to figure out who\u2019s writing Harold, Mr. Ferrell also brings a tender sense of longing to Harold\u2019s scenes with Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a sexy, anarchist baker whose tax return he is auditing.\n\nThis astute realism is not at all divorced from his comedy. Mr. Ferrell, who may be the best actor of the group, has shape-shifted through an extraordinary range of satiric characters, from his unsurpassed \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d portrayals of George W. Bush, using the word \u201cstrategery\u201d in a presidential debate, to the vivid heroes of \u201cAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\u201d and \u201cTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.\u201d\n\nIn his new comedy, \u201cBlades of Glory\u201d (opening Friday), he plays a macho champion figure skater named Chazz Michael Michaels, forced to team up with the sensitive Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder) in the pairs competition. Chazz is a flabby guy in a glittery red-and-gold costume, but the film\u2019s sports commentators insist, \u201cHe is sex on ice.\u201d Those skewering characters, at once larger-than-life and individualized, are as specific as Harold.\n\nThey are not, of course, as touching. There is a hint of Harold\u2019s sweetness in the film \u201cWinter Passing\u201d (2005), written and directed by the playwright Adam Rapp. In this offbeat drama about a reclusive novelist (Ed Harris), Mr. Ferrell offers subdued comic relief as a Christian rocker with goth eyeliner and stage fright, who stiffly mutters, \u201cRight on.\u201d (You can\u2019t blame Mr. Ferrell for his part in Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cMelinda and Melinda,\u201d in which he goes the way of many actors before him and morphs into a stuttery Woody substitute.)\n\nIn \u201cStranger Than Fiction\u201d Mr. Ferrell had the good luck \u2014 or good judgment \u2014 to be directed by Marc Forster, whose \u201cFinding Neverland\u201d was similarly touching but not syrupy, and whose captivating film deserved a bigger audience. It suffered, though, from comparisons to the stunning \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\u201d which had arrived two years earlier. Both create poignant emotion not from leaden drama but from a surreal situation laced with wit and romance.\n\nMr. Carrey has never been as moving or more genuine than in \u201cEternal Sunshine.\u201d All his manic Carreyness is buried, yet his energy and wit are preserved, as a man who has the memory of a bad love affair erased only to fall in love with the same woman (Kate Winslet) all over again. The director, Michel Gondry, and the screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, are among the most inventive filmmakers at work today, but Mr. Carrey gets credit for a performance so grounded that his impossible romance seems inevitable.\n\nHe is wasted, though, in the current thriller \u201cThe Number 23,\u201d as an ordinary family man whose obsession with that number leads back to his own dark psyche. Directed by Joel Schumacher, the film is slack where it should be taut and Hitchcockian. Worse, Mr. Carrey\u2019s amiable personality is so obscured that anyone could have played his cipher of a role. He doesn\u2019t disappear into a character; he just disappears.\n\nThere are better ways to banish the outsize persona that has taken him from Ace Ventura through Count Olaf in \u201cLemony Snicket\u2019s A Series of Unfortunate Events\u201d (2004). And Mr. Carrey has tried many of them.\n\nHe shows too much of the enormous Jim Carrey grin and too little emotion in his first major serious role, as a man unaware that his life is being televised, in Peter Weir\u2019s hit \u201cThe Truman Show\u201d (1998). Mr. Carrey\u2019s choice of project wasn\u2019t bad, though. The film, which seemed pretentious at the time, now seems prophetic in the eerily precise way it anticipates reality television, which was gestating at the same time.\n\nHe chose less well with \u201cThe Majestic\u201d (2001), a film done in by its glut of socially significant themes. Mr. Carrey plays a blacklisted B-movie screenwriter, Peter Appleton, who gets amnesia and wakes up in a small town where he is mistaken for a war hero. That might sound like a homage to Frank Capra, but the straight-faced mawkish tone of \u201cThe Majestic\u201d is a weakness of its director, Frank Darabont (\u201cThe Green Mile\u201d).\n\nIn the least convincing scene Peter actually lectures the House Un-American Activities Committee about the Constitution. There is something all too true, though, about a pre-amnesia scene in which he sits in bar after a studio has shut down production on his first A-list movie, \u201cAshes to Ashes,\u201d about a coal miners\u2019 strike. It would have been, he says, \u201cmy \u2018Grapes of Wrath,\u2019 my shot at doing something really good, somethin\u2019 \u2014 somethin\u2019!\u201d\n\nThe bartender asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d\n\n\u201cPain,\u201d Peter answers. \u201cNobility. The human condition.\u201d He laughs ironically at the way things turned out.\n\nThe irony should be directed at heavy-handed message films like \u201cAshes to Ashes,\u201d \u201cThe Majestic\u201d and \u201cReign Over Me,\u201d because even now comic actors often forget what Bill Murray learned the hard way. He got to star in his dream project, \u201cThe Razor\u2019s Edge\u201d (1984), as a World War I veteran in a changing world; the film was so ponderous, and Mr. Murray so awkward, it set his serious acting career back decades.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Sofia Coppola\u2019s \u201cLost in Translation\u201d (2003), followed quickly by Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cBroken Flowers\u201d (2005), that he learned how to stretch just enough to be touchingly real. As a faded actor flirting with a younger woman (Scarlett Johansson) in \u201cTranslation\u201d and a man who visits a series of old girlfriends in \u201cFlowers,\u201d he relies on the deadpan manner that was always his strength, even back when he was singing, \u201cStar Wars, nothing but Star Wars\u201d as a lounge singer on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d He infuses these film roles with a self-deprecating wit and a sense of surprise that isn\u2019t far from the Bill Murray who appears on the David Letterman show. Yet his characters are fully, entirely present in their fictional landscapes.\n\nAs wrongheaded as \u201cReign Over Me\u201d is, Mr. Sandler can always look to the Murray career model: there is hope ahead, and depth in less pompous projects. But there are no inflexible rules. Robin Williams, who reinvented the crying clown syndrome as the \u201cPatch Adams\u201d syndrome, went on to portray a deeply complicated character in Mark Romanek\u2019s \u201dOne Hour Photo\u201d (2002). Virtually unrecognizable with cropped, thinning blond hair, Mr. Williams subtly depicts the creepiness of a photo-shop clerk who stalks a family, yet evokes sympathy for his loneliness. There is not a trace of his hyper stand-up routine or the antic brilliance of \u201cMrs. Doubtfire.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s best to let the comic persona go, and just act.",

About 4,000 people were questioned for the public sample, but only 1,610 completed the one-hour interview. The completion rate is considered low by some poll-takers, but Dr. Pollock said that he had found the results acceptable ''because it was more important for us to get complete interviews than to interview the entire sample.''\n\nFor the leadership sample, 4,383 people in nine different fields were sent questionnaires by mail, and about 40 percent responded. The report defined as ''religious'' those people who said they prayed, attended worship services, felt that God loved them, read the Bible, participated in church activities and encouraged others to turn to religion. The study said that religious people in the public sample were far more concerned about the morality of such issues as abortion, homosexuality, national defense and women's rights than the leaders who responded.\n\nDr. Pollock said the report ''identifies a cohesive and powerful group of Americans, approximately 45 million strong, as intensely religious and demonstrates that religious Americans are likely to vote often and to become highly involved in their local communities.'' 73 Pct. Say God Loves Them\n\nSeventy-three percent of the public said they felt that God loved them, Dr. Pollock said, but only 54 percent of the leadership sample held that belief. The leaders also reported less frequent participation in religious activities than the general public.\n\nBusiness and religious leaders are more attuned to public values than others, according to the study, which was taken last fall. Asked which professional groups they most admired, 36 percent of the public named clergy, about twice the combined total of the second and third groups, teachers and scientists.\n\nThe attitudes of the clergy and business leaders more closely parallel the public's attitudes on religious and moral issues than do the beliefs held by government or other leaders, according to the report.",

    "text": "House Republicans on Friday unveiled a stopgap government funding measure that would include $4 billion in cuts over two weeks.\n\nThe plan met with tentative support from Senate Democrats, who portrayed the measure as similar to a plan they had been drafting that would include some of the cuts proposed by President Obama for his fiscal 2012 budget.\n\nThe moves were an indication that the gulf between Senate Democrats and House Republicans on keeping the government funded past early March is narrowing and that the threat of a government shutdown may be postponed.\n\n\"We are encouraged to hear that Republicans are abandoning their demands for extreme measures like cuts to border security, cancer research and food safety inspectors and instead moving closer to Democrats' position that we should cut government spending in a smart, responsible way that targets waste and excess while keeping our economy growing,\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-Nev.) spokesperson, Jon Summers, said in a statement Friday afternoon shortly before the release of the stopgap funding measure.\n\nSummers added that the measure being floated by Republicans \"sounds like a modified version of what Democrats were talking about.\"\n\n\"We're glad they think it's a good idea, but we should keep our focus on what we need to do to cut spending and keep our economy growing in the long-term,\" Summers said. \"If we need a little more time to agree on a responsible path forward, we should pass a short-term CR for no longer than the next month.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement that House Republicans plan to vote on the measure next week.\n\n\"The American people want the government to stay open, and they want us to cut spending,\" Boehner said. \"We're listening, and this responsible proposal will save taxpayers $4 billion by eliminating earmark slush funds and focusing on spending cuts President Obama already proposed.\"\n\nSummers renewed Democrats' criticism of Republicans' stance as a \"my way or the highway\" approach geared toward effecting a government shutdown. But in another sign that tensions are waning ahead of a looming March 4 deadline, Summers referred to that approach as one that Republicans \"have been taking in the past,\" adding that Democrats \"hope [the planned stopgap measure] is a sign that they have abandoned it and will work with Democrats moving forward.\"\n\nAmong the $4 billion in cuts included in the plan would be $1.24 billion cut from eight federal programs, many of which had been deemed ineffective or duplicative of other programs.\n\nFive of those cuts had been requested by Obama in his fiscal 2012 budget; they include Election Assistance Grants and the Department of Education's LEAP, Striving Reading, Even Start and Smaller Learning Communities programs. The other three cuts are to programs that did not receive funding requests in Obama's 2012 budget.\n\nThe $4 billion in cuts also includes $2.7 billion in earmarks. The earmarked funds would have gone toward a collection of homeland security, energy and water, and labor, health and education programs and projects.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also endorsed the plan Friday night, noting that \"President Obama and congressional Democrats agree with Republicans that these are potential areas to reduce spending, removing any excuses they have offered for demanding their status quo spending levels.\" \"As a result, there is now a clear path to finishing this short-term measure before the March 4th deadline,\" McConnell added. \"By supporting the House bill, our friends on the other side of the aisle will have the chance to ensure that the government remains operational while we work with them to identify additional ways to shrink Washington spending this year.\"\n\nAn agreement on a short-term plan would mean that the threat of a government shutdown would be postponed until mid- to late March. But wide disagreements remain between both parties over the scope of any longer-term budget cuts.\n\nIn his statement Friday, Boehner said that \"keeping the already-high, 'stimulus'-inflated spending levels in place -- as Senate Democrats have proposed on this short-term bill -- is unacceptable.\" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), meanwhile, cautioned Democrats in a Friday statement \"to make sure that their cuts are significant and serious spending reduction proposals, not just minor efforts to trim around the edges.\"\n\nAnd earlier this week, House Democrats hit back against Republicans' proposal to cut $61 billion from federal spending over the next seven months, warning that the measure \"would hinder our ability to ensure the safety of our food, rebuild America, secure our nation and educate our children.\"\n\nIn a report issued Thursday by the Democratic staff of the House Appropriations Committee, Democrats translated the dollar amounts of the Republican-proposed cuts into figures related to jobs and programs.\n\nDemocrats have also pointed to a report by the liberal Economic Policy Institute projecting that the House-passed spending resolution would result in the loss of 800,000 private and public-sector jobs, as well as a report by a Goldman Sachs analyst that the House GOP cuts could reduce the country's economic growth by as much as two percentage points in the second and third quarters of the year.\n\nFriday morning, House Republican leaders renewed their criticism of Senate Democrats' proposal as \"defending the status quo in Washington.\"\n\nMeanwhile, both sides have been hustling to avert blame in case a government shutdown does indeed happen. A release from Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy's (R-Calif.) office Friday afternoon detailing House Republicans' short-term spending plan was headlined: \"House Republicans Continue Working to Avoid a Government Shutdown.\"\n\nThis post has been updated since it was first published.",

    "text": "Cycling has an unusual problem: Bikes are too often too awesome.\n\nFrequently made of expensive materials and featuring up to 33 speeds, bicycles can be intimidating. It is a reason that the number of people cycling has barely budged in recent years, while participation has soared for running.\n\nBut there is new hope for cycling. Bike makers are paying more attention to people interested in zipping to the coffee shop instead of through the Pyrenees. These riders want the health benefits that come with pedaling without ending up drenched in sweat. The most basic bikes\u2014those without exotic parts or elaborate gears\u2014are suddenly selling.\n\n\u201cMore people are getting into biking to go to the farmer\u2019s market, ride around the neighborhood, ride around with their kids,\u201d says Mark Trimble, co-owner of Pedal the Planet bike shop in Lexington, Ky. He says riders are \u201cmoving away from dressing like insects, tight Lycra and all that stuff.\u201d\n\nA core group of enthusiasts remains happy to shell out $3,000 to $10,000 or more for models with ultralight carbon-fiber skeletons and parts.\n\nBut members of the bike industry admit that they\u2019ve done a lousy job recruiting many new riders. So manufacturers, led by small, independent companies, have retooled one of the biggest obstacles to getting into cycling: the bikes themselves.\n\nNew models let riders sit in a more comfortable, upright position the way an old-school Schwinn did, but with lighter bike frames. They often have eight speeds or fewer, rather than the 18 to 33 on more complex bikes. Some bikes feature internal gears protected from dirt instead of the exposed jaws of traditional systems.\n\n\u201cI ride my bike purely to get from one place to another\u2014not, \u2018I\u2019m going to take this out for exercise for like 20 miles,\u2019 \u201d says Cassie Rae DuBay, a 28-year-old law librarian in Dallas. She says she aims to \u201cadd a little exercise to my day by riding 2 miles, as opposed to driving.\u201d\n\nAbout a year ago, Ms. DuBay bought a Dutch-style three-speed from Linus Bike of Venice, Calif., for $550 after a $50 discount. The company promotes its bikes for short trips, like the ones she takes to work or the gym.\n\nFor nearly a year, Ms. DuBay had put off buying a bike. First she felt she would be out of place with the geared-up cyclists in Seattle, where she attended graduate school. Then she was paralyzed by the hundreds of models and styles to choose from. She settled on a Linus based on a recommendation from a cycling friend.\n\nMs. DuBay found it much easier to integrate into the world of running. \u201cIt was just like, go get fitted for shoes and start moving,\u201d she says.\n\nRunning participation in the U.S. jumped 20% from 2009 to 2014, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. That growth is tied to how inclusive the sport has become. For every hard-core distance runner, there are plenty of others just looking for a bit of exercise and enjoyment. An explosion of costumed 5K races and wine-country half-marathons has prized fun over finishing times. Meanwhile, bicycling participation has barely budged.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at a marathon or half-marathon, you will see people walking, and they\u2019re not ashamed,\u201d says Fred Clements, executive director of the National Bicycle Dealers Association. \u201cThey\u2019re not made to feel embarrassed. And that\u2019s something that you won\u2019t really see at a bicycling event. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re as far along as running is in making events that appeal to everyone.\u201d\n\nThe popularity of stationary-cycling classes, which have boomed in recent years, hasn't translated to growth in real cycling. But bike-share programs and expanded bike lanes, once viewed as oddities for tourists to try while visiting Amsterdam, are now standard in many U.S. cities. Many of today\u2019s hottest-selling bikes mimic the models in bike shares, with three speeds, upright seating and easy-to-board frames.\n\nAdam Bertoni, a 36-year-old insurance claims manager, says he got the urge to start biking around town after moving to the bike-friendly Minneapolis area from Cleveland. \u201cThe amount of research I had to put into just trying to find a bike to fit my needs was a pain,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Bertoni found a mountain-road-hybrid bike with its 21 gears too cumbersome. A single-speed bike was too difficult to pedal up hills. He read about Priority Bicycles, a New York-based bicycle brand, and ordered one online.\n\nMr. Bertoni likes its smooth ride and the simplicity of its synthetic belt drive, a greaseless alternative to a bike chain that leaves his pants legs clean. The three-speed bike also has puncture-resistant tires and that staple of children\u2019s cycles, the coaster brake.\n\nPriority launched a year ago on Kickstarter, speeding past its $30,000 goal to raise $550,000. Founder Dave Weiner worked for years in bike repair and on bike-industry software, and says his aim was to build a high-quality bike that required no routine maintenance. The $400 bikes, which are sold online-only, arrive with a tire pump.\n\nPublic Bikes, based in San Francisco, sells primarily online and has three retail locations that aim to feel airier than the typical, cramped bike shop. A fourth location, in Portland, Ore., is scheduled to open this week. Traditional bike shops are crowded with equipment, and their employees can be better at talking to hard-core cyclists than newcomers.\n\n\u201cWe want to create an inviting, accessible gallery experience where the bikes have the breathing room to call attention to the color and the form,\u201d chief operating officer Dan Nguyen-Tan says.\n\nThe company\u2019s most popular models, which run from $350 to $1,000, have frames traditionally viewed as women\u2019s bikes\u2014a rider steps through, rather than lifting one leg over a bar. This ease-of-use attracts male buyers, too, Mr. Nguyen-Tan says. In a video on Public\u2019s website, he describes one bike as perfect for people who wear \u201cskirts, dresses or kilts.\u201d\n\nLarger companies are following smaller firms\u2019 urban trail. Performance Bicycle, a bike-shop chain with more than 100 locations in 19 states, recently launched a line of single-speed and three-speed urban bikes for around $200 aimed at cost-conscious 20-somethings.\n\nTrek Bicycle Corp. bought a maker of casual bikes, Electra, in early 2014. That year, Electra\u2019s cruiser-style Townie Original 7D women\u2019s bike was the nation\u2019s top-selling model at independent bike shops, an Electra spokeswoman says. It now sells for $500.\n\nIn all, sales in dollars of leisure bikes surged 19% in the 12-month period ended in March, according to data from bike shops analyzed by NPD Group. Sales of racing-style road bikes dropped 3% in the same period. Most bike sales, in dollars, are made at bike shops.\n\nThis spring, Giant Bicycles launched a separate brand for casual bikes called Momentum. Its Street model, as seen on Momentum\u2019s stand-alone website, retails for $425 and comes with a cupholder, U-lock carrier and light-load rack over the rear wheel.\n\n\u201cThat $400 price point is a pretty important one,\u201d Giant spokesman Nick Legan says.\n\nFor decades, manufacturers made bikes with as many gears as possible, says Shawn Granton, a Portland, Ore., enthusiast of three-speed bicycles. In recent years, urban bike messengers adopted fixed-gear bicycles because of their ease to maintain. Fixed-gear bikes have no freewheel mechanism, so the pedals move when the rear wheel moves. \u201cPeople started thinking about simplicity in bikes again,\u201d Mr. Granton says.\n\nAfter some less attractive versions, he says, manufacturers are \u201cmaking an urban bike that\u2019s stylish, that somebody would actually want to ride.\u201d\n\nWrite to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com",

Medical staff at a nearby hospital later pronounced her dead.\n\nState health officials said the licensed clinic has no active complaints. Yet the newspaper linked Encore to an active medical malpractice case and a 2013 death at another Hialeah clinic following a buttocks augmentation.\n\nRepresentatives for the Hialeah Police Department didn\u2019t immediately respond Friday to a request for comment, and they didn\u2019t disclose to the Herald what procedure Encore had performed on Meadows. Officials at Encore didn\u2019t immediately return a phone call or email.\n\nFake Calif. doctor gets 20 years for botched surgery\n\n\u201cYou all are not answering questions as to what happened to Heather Meadows,\u201d a Facebook user wrote on Encore\u2019s page Friday. \u201cWe all know she was rushed to the hospital and later pronounced dead.\u201d\n\nCoroners conducted an autopsy on Meadows Friday, but no results will be available until after police complete their investigation, said Darren Caprara, director of operations at the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner Department.\n\nState laws prevent Florida health officials from revealing open complaints against license holders until 10 days after finding probable cause, Department of Health spokeswoman Mara Gambineri said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe can assure the public that we will be diligent and thorough in protecting them from unsafe or unscrupulous health care practice,\u201d Gambineri said. \u201cIn any complaint investigation, the department uses its authority to subpoena all relevant records and to conduct interviews that will support the investigation. Every health care licensee is afforded due process rights under the law.\u201d\n\nEncore\u2019s website and Facebook page promote breast implants, Brazilian butt lifts, rhinoplasty, liposuction and a procedure called a \u201cMommy Makeover.\u201d A woman interviewed outside the clinic by WSVN-TV said Encore offered her a cosmetic operation at $8,000 less than competitors.\n\n\u201cI'm not having surgery here. Are you kidding me? This is a chop shop,\u201d the woman said. She asked for her deposit back after the news station told her about Meadows\u2019 death.\n\nRecords cited by the Herald show Encore President Ismael Labrador paid a $30,000 fine in 2007 after police said he employed unlicensed doctors. A 51-year-old woman died in July 2013 due to complications from her surgery in Hialeah at Vanity Cosmetic Surgery, which Labrador owns.\n\nState health officials are trying to revoke the license of Dr. Osakatukei (Osak) Omulepu, who has been listed on Encore\u2019s website, on grounds of medical malpractice after they said he seriously injured four patients in two days at Vanity and another clinic. He has denied the charges.\n\nFriends and family of Meadows, the mother of a newborn baby girl and a 6-year-old boy, were left coping with their grief by posting tributes to her on social media.\n\n\u201cDon't know why such a beautiful, young lady like you had to be taken from us this time,\u201d her cousin wrote on Facebook. \u201cAs I am writing this, I find myself holding back tears.

Stern in the Anna Nicole Smith case, said these developments could affect the case.\n\n\"The pursuit of a book deal, coupled with the sale of the surveillance video, clearly demonstrates that the owner is interested in money and publicity, and has trumped up the allegations against Ms. Lohan to further his own interests, not to seek justice,\" Sadow said.\n\nThe penalty for a felony grand theft conviction ranges from 16 months to three years in a California state prison. The exact term would be based on the value of the property stolen and the criminal record of the defendant.\n\nShoplifting offenses are charged as petty theft if the property taken is valued at less than $950. The store owner claims the \"one of a kind\" necklace is worth $2,500, police said.\n\nLohan has been in court nine times in the past 10 months, mostly for hearings related to probation violations for her drunk driving case.\n\nShe did a short stint in jail last year, but also checked into substance abuse rehab twice under court order.",

    "text": "NEWARK \u2014 Deep into a raucous comedy set at Symphony Hall here on Friday night, Katt Williams briefly halted his mockery of the Boston Marathon bombers, the Roman Catholic Church and racially inclusive cereal commercials for a moment of sincerity.\n\nThough it may often feel as if we are living in a world that desperately needs to change, Mr. Williams said, \u201cthe only thing we can fix is us.\u201d\n\nAnd as Mr. Williams would be the first to tell you, his life has lately been badly in need of repairs.\n\nKnown for a bold sartorial style and a frenzied stage presence that is part revivalist preacher and part Warner Bros. cartoon, Mr. Williams, 40, has accumulated a rap sheet of misdeeds and erratic behavior to rival his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of stand-up specials like \u201cIt\u2019s Pimpin\u2019 Pimpin\u2019 \u201d and \u201cKattpacalypse.\u201d\n\nIn the past three years, he has been arrested on suspicion of assault and child endangerment; he has been hit with tax liens; he has feuded with audience members at his own shows; and he has angered fans for missing performances outright.\n\nThen, at the end of 2012, he declared \u2014 for the second time in his career \u2014 that he was retiring from stand-up altogether. Still, he remains notorious enough to merit a sendup on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d where he was impersonated this weekend by the hip-hop star Drake, portrayed as an eager advocate of Colorado\u2019s recreational marijuana shops.\n\nAs a more mellow and contemplative Mr. Williams admitted, up to a point, in an interview Friday afternoon in Manhattan, the devastation he had brought upon himself had been thorough. But what mattered more, he said, was how he bounced back from it.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve lived a perfect life \u2014 if a tornado comes and tears down everything you\u2019ve got, it\u2019s time to rebuild,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just hope you rebuild for the better.\u201d\n\nFaced with challenges, \u201cI failed miserably,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cAnd the blessing when you strike out really bad is, it makes the home runs look better.\u201d\n\nAs he sat in a suite at the Trump SoHo hotel, dressed in a designer sport coat, jeans and a jewel-encrusted pinkie ring in the shape of a lion\u2019s head, Mr. Williams, who describes himself as a \u201csociable recluse,\u201d was alternately humble and defiant, confessional and elusive.\n\nWith more than 25 confirmed shows through the end of May on his new \u201cGrowth Spurt\u201d tour, this 5-foot-5 entertainer was not interested in itemizing his transgressions of recent months. (He said, with a sardonic laugh, that he had broken two ribs and three fingers in a \u201cpolice interaction.\u201d)\n\nNor did Mr. Williams want to specify exactly what steps he had taken to right his life in the many months he had been out of the public eye, except to say that taking a personal inventory and \u201ca step back\u201d had been involved.\n\nAt the end of this process, he said, he has realized \u201cthe brain is as fragile a muscle as any that we have.\u201d\n\nHe also seemed to be aware that volatility is part of his character and that he must always account for it in stressful situations. \u201cConsequently, I should make better decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet, in the heat of the moment, if a guy out of nowhere says something he should never say, the realness in me says I should respond to it.\u201d\n\nTo his peers and others in comedy, Mr. Williams\u2019s misadventures have only burnished his reputation as a fearless and unpredictable performer. They seem of a piece with a comic who, in the span of a single joke, can talk about the troubling ambiguity of the word \u201cinsurgent\u201d and the devastating potency of modern-day marijuana.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the outlaw who tells the truth,\u201d said Jonas Larsen, Comedy Central\u2019s senior vice president for specials and talent.\n\n\u201cThat over-the-top persona, coupled with his personal troubles, has probably helped him, to his advantage, to build up his cult of personality,\u201d Mr. Larsen added.\n\nCaroline Hirsch, founder of the club Carolines on Broadway, fondly recalled a 2008 incident in which Mr. Williams nearly missed his New York Comedy Festival show at Carnegie Hall after the police found guns on his tour bus.\n\nIn the frantic moments after Mr. Williams was arraigned and posted bond, \u201che got up to Carnegie Hall and took a quick shower there,\u201d Ms. Hirsch recalled. \u201cHis lawyers brought all of his clothes, and he went onstage. He carried on like a trouper.\u201d\n\nBoth Mr. Larsen and Ms. Hirsch said they would gladly work with Mr. Williams again. \u201cYou\u2019re always as good as your last concert,\u201d Ms. Hirsch said.\n\nNeal Brennan, the veteran stand-up and co-creator of \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show,\u201d said that Mr. Williams\u2019s personal problems may sometimes \u201cget the best of him,\u201d but that ultimately \u201cevery comedian has mental issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of, how manageable are they?\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cIs it something you can just cover up with smoking weed, or drinking or sex addiction?\u201d\n\nWhat audiences care about is the work and not the personal difficulties, Mr. Brennan said, \u201cand if you\u2019re looking for proof, ask Woody Allen.\u201d\n\nAsked in the interview if he should consider giving up comedy for the sake of his health, Mr. Williams replied with a knowing chuckle. \u201cI did it already,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Williams said he felt stung by the handful of shows at which his temper overcame him and he had let audiences down. If his once-perfect track record had been marred by three incidents, Mr. Williams said he was \u201ccertainly not happy about the three, and certainly so cognizant about the three,\u201d and that these blemishes had to be dealt with.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I never really lost before,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf you can find an area where you think I should do better, it is almost assured that I agree with you,\u201d he said. But whatever his detractors or devotees believed about him, Mr. Williams said, these were only perceptions.\n\n\u201cAnd the beauty is, whatever your perception is, you can change it,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Williams addressed some of his private conflicts in the sold-out and enthusiastically received performance Friday. He joked that he was working on a new program called stay the heck (he used a different word) out of jail, and said that he would not criticize Paula Deen, the disgraced celebrity chef, because everyone deserved a second chance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on my fifth second chance right now,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Williams concluded the 75-minute set with his account of a 2012 incident in Sacramento, in which he reportedly led the police on a high-speed chase while he drove a three-wheeled motorbike. Step by step, he described what he said was his 50-miles-an-hour flight from what he thought was a mall security guard who turned out to be a \u201creal officer\u201d with a \u201creal gun.\u201d\n\nWith exaggerated decorum, Mr. Williams said, \u201cWhat a terrible misunderstanding this has been,\u201d to the approving laughter of his audience.\n\nBackstage after the show, Mr. Williams was celebrating with a crowd that included the talk-show host Tavis Smiley and the comedian Ashima Franklin, one of his openers.\n\nAsked if his retelling of the Sacramento story was accurate, Mr. Williams replied through a grin: \u201cIt\u2019s a totally true story. And I\u2019ve got the videotape to prove it.\u201d",

    "text": "By Janet McConnaughey, Associated Press Writer\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u0097 Ron Forman wants to change grown-ups' views of bugs and spiders from \"ewww!\" to \"cool!\" After all, such critters clean the earth, pollinate plants and form a huge chunk of the food chain.\n\n\"Without insects, nature doesn't exist,\" said Forman, chief executive of the new Audubon Insectarium, the first major tourist attraction to open in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe facility, built with $6.2 million in private donations and $20 million in public money, is one of only a few stand-alone, nonprofit insectariums.\n\nIn New Orleans, displays include spiders, centipedes and crawfish as well as ants, mosquitoes and other insectoid six-leggers. Nit-pickers might say that means it isn't an insectarium. \"Arthropodarium\" might be appropriate.\n\nWhatever it's called, thousands of live and mounted bugs went on display when the Insectarium opened June 13 in 23,000 square feet of the old U.S. Custom House near the French Quarter.\n\nSome creatures, like the butterflies stretching crumpled wings in the metamorphosis room and fluttering about the Japanese-style butterfly garden, are short-lived. The butterfly population is kept up by purchasing about 700 a week in chrysalis form, the stage between caterpillar and adult.\n\nChief entomologist Jayme Necaise estimates 35,000 live residents, with another 15,000 mounted, emphasizing there's no way to get a headcount on the colonies of ants and termites.\n\nHurricane Katrina dealt a setback to plans for opening the insectarium when it flooded 80% of New Orleans in August 2005. Audubon Institute's Aquarium of the Americas on the riverfront took heavy damage, though the Audubon Zoo fared better.\n\nThe insectarium had been expected to open in the summer of 2007. The Custom House stayed dry, but it was a year before the federal government let workers back into the building.\n\nThe Custom House's historic status \u2014 construction started in 1849 \u2014 challenged builders and designers. Nothing could be permanently installed, Audubon spokeswoman Melissa Lee said. Backdrops are painted and sculpted on tall wooden walls within the high-ceilinged rooms and corridors. The institute needed federal permission to disguise a fat load-bearing column in one room as a cypress tree.\n\nThe tall, wide doors are untouched, so people can see where horse-drawn carriages once hauled imports and exports for inspection by customs agents, Lee said.\n\nThe rest is a mix of science and whimsy. A wide entry room where visitors can wait and buy tickets opens into the carriageway and an exhibit about prehistoric bugs.\n\nModels of dragonflies with 30-inch wingspans move on tracks below the ceiling. \"They really were that big,\" Lee said. In a case, a less-than-life-size model Coelophysis \u2014 a sharp-toothed raptor that grew up to 9 feet high \u2014 chases a fist-sized model dragonfly.\n\nOff the carriageway is a tunnel designed to give people a bug's-eye-view from underground. An earthworm about 18 inches across loops through one bit; mites are the size of plums.\n\nOutside bathrooms, dung beetles roll balls of waste in an exhibit framed by a yard-high imitation of such a ball. Entomologist Zachary Lemann leaned over in wonder at the bugs. \"Look at them. They're so cute! So cuuuuute!\"\n\nLemann doesn't just coo over bugs; he cooks them, working with Insectarium chef Alan Ehrich in the display kitchen where photographs include a huge picture of a Thai child happily eating spiders-on-a-stick.\n\nVisitors are offered free samples of edible bug snacks like \"chocolate chirp cookies,\" crispy Cajun crickets, mealworm egg rolls and deep-fried dragonflies.\n\nSome exhibits are themed, including Termites (for which the exterminator Terminix has pledged $2 million in funding), Louisiana Swamp, Success Stories, which includes a machine to test whether you can pedal as fast as a cricket can hop, and a Hall of Fame \u2014 biggest, smallest, fastest and so on.\n\nThere's also an \"Insect Awards Night\" theater, where the seats shake as a cartoon Goliath beetle stomps across the stage. A stink bug's squirt is accompanied by a puff of air.\n\nThere are probably about 100 insectariums and butterfly houses around the country, but most are part of zoos or botanical gardens, said Joseph Norton, director of the Sophia M. Sachs Butterfly House outside St. Louis in Chesterfield, Mo. He said there also are stand-alone for-profit enterprises in Florida, Georgia and Missouri. Some were set up by exterminating companies, ranging from Insectropolis in Toms River, N.J., to the Cockroach Hall of Fame in Plano, Texas, with dioramas of painted and dressed-up roaches.\n\nThe Montreal Insectarium, model for the New Orleans museum, gets 400,000 visitors a year. Audubon officials expect about 350,000 a year in New Orleans, Lee said.\n\n\"I'm going to have to go there,\" said Katharine Edler, 23, who tends bar nearby in the French Quarter. \"And I don't even like bugs!\"\n\nCopyright 2008 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Under withering fire from political opponents, Barack Obama is once again shuffling his Syria cards, hoping against hope that he can salvage US credibility from the wreckage of his twin failures to defeat Isis terror and topple Bashar al-Assad.\n\nFear is driving Obama\u2019s latest rethink: fear that Russia and Iran are winning the strategic tug-of-war for decisive influence in both Syria and Iraq; and fear that his Middle East legacy will be an anarchic arc of muddle and mayhem stretching from Mosul to the Mediterranean.\n\nUS officials told Congress this week the White House is considering a range of rejigged military options to fight Isis. They include temporary deployments of limited numbers of special forces in Syria, and attack helicopters in Iraq, plus more forward-based target-spotters to increase the accuracy and efficacy of coalition air strikes.\n\nAsh Carter, the US defence secretary, indicated the Pentagon was encouraged by the success of last week\u2019s Delta Force operation to rescue Isis hostages in Hawija, northern Iraq. He predicted \u201cmore of this kind of thing\u201d.\n\nCarter said the revamped strategy would focus on the \u201cthree Rs\u201d \u2013 raids, Raqqa [the Isis stronghold in Syria] and Ramadi [the capital of Iraq\u2019s Anbar province, which fell to Isis in May].\n\n\u201cWe expect to intensify our air campaign, including with additional US and coalition aircraft, to target Isil with a higher and heavier rate of strikes,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, US forces would not shy away from \u201cdirect action on the ground\u201d.\n\nDespite Turkish objections, Washington is also considering closer cooperation with Syrian Kurdish militias that have ejected Isis from territory along Syria\u2019s northern border.\n\nObama\u2019s rethink does not mean he is about to renege on his vow to avoid \u201cboots on the ground\u201d combat operations in Syria, despite excitable reports to the contrary. Nor is he about to recommence war-fighting in Iraq.\n\nBut as in Afghanistan, where he recently postponed troop withdrawals indefinitely, this latest rejig smacks of desperation. It is another reminder of how Obama\u2019s trademark policy to free the US of its Middle Eastern military entanglements has foundered on geopolitical realities.\n\nObama declined to attack Assad even after the Syrian president crossed a red line by using chemical weapons. His attempts to train Syrian rebels flopped. In Iraq, 3,500 US trainers and advisers have been unable to improve the Iraqi army\u2019s dismal performance.\n\nNow Iraq\u2019s parliament, dominated by pro-Iran Shias who say the US has let Iraq down, is pressing the prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, to invite Russia to extend its Syrian air raids into Iraq, too.\n\nThere can be little doubt Vladimir Putin would dearly like to supplant the US as Baghdad\u2019s new best friend. As with his backing of Assad against the west, Russia\u2019s leader is waging a wider struggle for Middle East influence and power.\n\nObama\u2019s predicament helps explain why the US is showing more interest in a compromise transition deal to end the Syrian war, along lines proposed by Moscow. Commentators say the White House is ready to try anything.\n\nIran\u2019s inclusion in Friday\u2019s Vienna talks, although welcome in several respects, is essentially a concession prompted by US weakness. It comes despite Tehran\u2019s announcement this week of increased military support for Assad.\n\nObama\u2019s many critics say his visceral fear of the Middle East quagmire has allowed Iran and Russia to run rings around him. Veteran columnist Charles Krauthammer was typically scathing: \u201cObama\u2019s response to all this? Nothing. He has washed his hands of the region, still the centre of world oil production and trade, and still the world\u2019s most volatile region, seething with virulent jihadism ready for export,\u201d Krauthammer wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen you call something a quagmire, you have told the world that you\u2019re out and staying out. Russia and Iran will have their way.\u201d",

    "text": "Adult film star Jessica Drake came forward on Saturday to accuse Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of sexual misconduct.\n\nIn a press conference with her lawyer Gloria Allred by her side, Drake claimed Trump had tightly hugged and kissed her without her permission at a golf tournament in Tahoe, California, 10 years ago.\n\nDrake said in the press conference that the then-reality star asked her to his suite, but when she declined he allegedly tried to offer her $10,000, as well as his jet, in exchange for spending the night with him.\n\n\u201cI am a feminist, an advocate for women\u2019s rights, the rights for sex workers,\u201d Drake said, \u201cI am involved with many charities, locally and internationally. For the past five years, I\u2019ve been involved in sex education.\n\n\u201cHe flirted with me and invited me to walk along the golf course with him, which I did, she continued. \u201cDuring that time he asked me for my phone number, which I gave to him. Later that evening, he invited me his room. I said I didn\u2019t feel right going alone. So two other women came with me.\n\n\u201cIn the penthouse suite I met Donald again. When we entered the room he grabbed each of us tightly in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking permission.\u201d\n\nDrake, who said Trump was wearing pajamas and was with his bodyguard, asked the women about working in the porn industry before they left 30 to 40 minutes later. She claims that after she returned to her room, she got a call from a man acting on Trump\u2019s behalf, asking her to return.\n\n\u201cThen Donald called,\u201d Drake said. \u201cHe asked me to return to his suite and have dinner with him. And he invited me to a party. I declined. Then Donald asked me, \u2018What do you want? How much?\u2019 I told him I couldn\u2019t, because I had to return to L.A. for work. I said that as an excuse because I didn\u2019t want him to continue asking me and i didn\u2019t want to be with him.\n\n\u201cAfter that I received another call, from Donald or a man calling on his behalf, offering me $10,000,\u201d she said. \u201cI declined again, and made as an excuse I had to return to Los Angeles for work. I was then told Mr. Trump would allow me to use his private jet if I accepted his invitation.\u201d\n\nShe said she immediately told two of her friends about the incident.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need fame,\u201d she said during the conference. \u201cThis is not acceptable behavior for anyone, much less a candidate for president. I am not looking for monetary compensation, I understand I will be called a liar or an opportunist but I will risk that to stand in solidarity to the other women coming forward.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign issued a statement in response to Drake\u2019s accusation and the photo she showed during her press conference:\n\n\u201cThis story is totally false and ridiculous. The picture is one of thousands taken out of respect for people asking to have their picture taken with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her. This is just another attempt by the Clinton campaign to defame a candidate who just today is number one in three different polls. Anyone who would pay thugs to incite violence at a rally against American citizens, as was released on video, will stop at nothing. Just another example of the Clinton campaign trying to rig the election.\u201d\n\nAllred made it clear that Drake was not seeking any monetary compensation.\n\nThe 42-year-old Dallas, Texas native was born in 1974 as Angela Patrice Heaslet, according to her IMDb page. She\u2019s been credited in 228 videos, making her adult film debut in 2000.\n\nAt the time of Drake and Trump\u2019s alleged incident, Trump had been married to current wife Melania Trump for a year. It was also roughly one year after the GOP nominee\u2019s now infamous hot mic tape from Access Hollywood where he bragged about grabbing women by their genitals and kissing them without his permission. He later apologized for his statements in the tape, calling it \u201clocker-room talk\u201d and saying he never kissed or touched a woman without her consent.\n\nIncluding Drake, 11 women have come forward since the release of the Access Hollywood tape in Oct. 7 to publicly accuse Trump of sexual misconduct \u2014 including a former PEOPLE reporter. Trump has vehemently denied all the allegations against him and has never been charged with any crime relating to the accusations.",

    "text": "It was the fifth inning and the score was tied, 0-0, in our softball league championship game. Gary led off with a triple, and as third base coach and co-manager of the team, I warned him that if the ball was hit to the left side of the infield, he should stay where he was. Sure enough, the ball was hit sharply to third, but Gary took off anyway, completely disregarding my advice. He was easily thrown out at home plate. As I shook my head in dismay, one player ran on the field, waving his arms at me, shouting, \"I'm taking over.\"\n\nIt was an ugly, unnecessary scene, especially since he didn't know, and obviously didn't care, that I hadn't told Gary to run, or that I was the coach, not he. As I sent him back to the bench, I couldn't help but think how different this was from the all-women's softball team I coached. Not only would a female player have heeded my instructions and stayed put, but it was unlikely that anyone on that team would have verbally questioned what I'd done, even if I had foolishly sent the runner home.\n\nA dozen years ago my friend Sherri, who played alongside me on a coed team, suggested I come out and watch her play for a women's team. Most of the women, she explained, were either actresses or waitresses, often both, which meant they had their days free. I was curious, so I wandered over to the park one Wednesday morning to check it out. The women were good players, took the game seriously and wanted to win, but unlike the men's teams I'd played on, it wasn't win at any cost.\n\nSeveral weeks into the season their coach quit, and Sherri asked me to take over. And so for the next ten years I was out there every Wednesday morning, coaching 15 women who played for the Raccoon Lodge, a New York City bar, in what was known as the Restaurant League.\n\nThe women actually sought out advice, whether it be about batting, fielding or strategy. Men, on the other hand, might offer unsolicited advice and criticism to one another, but rarely do they ask for it.\n\nMen are also far more apt to argue, whether it's over safe and out calls or balls and strikes. A woman might shake her head or roll her eyes, but rarely will she outwardly challenge authority. I do remember one day our pitcher, Gail, vehemently disagreed with an umpire's calls. She razzed him unmercifully until he finally threw her out of the game. She sat in the stands, still harassing him, and stopped only when he threatened to throw her out of the park. But this kind of behavior is the exception. It's not that women accept injustice, it's just that they don't seem to verbalize as much as men do.\n\nWomen don't complain about where they're put in the batting order or what position they're assigned to. And rarely do women sulk about playing time or criticize a teammate, something I see all the time on men's teams, where it's too often about ego as opposed to what's best for the team.\n\nMen often see their opponents as the enemy and treat them as such. Not so with women. Sure, they want to win just as much as men do, but in general they're far friendlier to their opponents, and when the game is over, win or lose, they fraternize with their teammates and the other team. When men finish the obligatory high-fiving the other team, each side retreats to its own bench, either celebrating the win or commiserating over the loss. Women prefer to share a common bench, chatting with one another between innings, and celebrations are left on the field.\n\nMen tend to rehash games and particular plays for weeks, months or even years after they've been played. Women rarely discuss the game once it's over. For women it truly seems to be about the fun they have and the relationships forged with one another, while for men it really is all about winning.\n\nThe women I've coached may have learned something about playing softball from me, but I've learned more about relationships and sportsmanship from them. That's a pretty good trade, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nCharles Salzberg is the author of more than 20 nonfiction books and a recent novel, Swann's Last Song.",

    "text": "Arnold N. Kriss, the Police Department's deputy commissioner for trials, remembers the case vividly: It involved a New York City police officer who liked a good game of Frisbee.\n\nThe officer had been on sick leave for months, receiving full salary as he ''recuperated'' from a back injury. But when the Police Department's internal affairs officers began checking up on him, Mr. Kriss said: ''They caught him bowling. They even got him on film playing Frisbee in the park - jumping up and down, tossing his 40-pound kid up in the air and catching him. I mean, they had this on film.''\n\nPolice officials call such incidents ''scams,'' the kind of departmental abuse they say has replaced the serious, institutionalized corruption exposed by such officers as Frank Serpico in the Knapp Commission hearings 11 years ago. Stealing Money and Gasoline\n\nWhere investigators once found evidence of widespread payoffs from narcotics dealers or other criminals, they are now more likely to uncover instances of an officer's stealing time, money or even gasoline from the department itself.\n\nPolice Commissioner Robert J. McGuire stressed that when it came to officers who abused the law or police rules, ''we're talking about an incredibly small number of employees.''\n\n''In fact,'' he said, ''I've never seen a more dedicated, hardworking, honest group of people in my life.'' In the last decade the department has set up an intricate series of checks and controls. These include undercover integrity tests of officers and an ''associates'' program in which precinct officers make secret reports on colleagues suspected of misconduct.\n\nThese controls, department officials say, have had marked success. Was Formerly Widespread\n\nChief John Guido, who heads the department's anticorruption efforts, said: ''Before the Knapp Commission, police corruption was widespread and institutionalized.''\n\nIn recent years, he said, ''no case has involved more than five officers acting together, and those cases are rare.'' Roderick C. Lankler, the state's special prosecutor, said the Police Department ''should be proud of its record'' on corruption, adding that ''by and large corruption there is an isolated event now.''\n\nPhilip Caruso, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association said, ''When it comes to corruption, we're the most pristine department in the city.''\n\nIn 1980, the New York City Police Department - which has 22,300 officers -suspended 124 officers for misconduct and dismissed 29 others for actual crimes, or serious or repeated rule infractions.\n\nMr. Kriss and other police officials said that the most widespread problems in the department covered ''new areas of abuse - sick leave, overtime and military leave.'' Types of Offenses\n\nGenerally, reports showed that an errant officer these days might have submitted false military or sick leave requests or might have been involved in petty theft.\n\nAccording to departmental reports, last year an officer siphoned gas from a police patrol wagon, another shoplifted two packages of spark plugs, while a third made menacing, late-night calls to his commanding officer.\n\nOne report said an officer ''did on diverse occasions carry a jewelry display case not needed for the performance of his official duties.''\n\nThe report said the officer was selling jewelry - making sales calls in his police uniform as he patrolled his beat and leaving his post if he had a prospective customer across town.\n\nMost of these cases, Mr. Kriss said, were handled through departmental trials that led to suspensions, or to the loss of some vacation days. The jewelry seller was suspended for two months. Dismissal in Severe Cases\n\nBut when the chicanery and fraud were severe, Mr. Kriss said, the officers were dismissed after they were found guilty in departmental trials.\n\n''Cops on phony sick leave are not only getting paid full salary, they're off the job while other cops are working their tails off in the streets,'' he said.\n\nOf the 29 dismissed officers, 11 were convicted of felonies in State Supreme Court, while the remaining 18 were convicted after departmental trials, Mr. Kriss said.\n\nHe added that the felony convictions dealt with everything from assault to arson for insurance, ''but most of these crimes were committed when the officers were off duty, and were not directly connected with their police duties.''\n\nThe largest case in 1980 involved five officers accused of beating a prisoner at a central booking facility in Queens. The five have been indicted, but have not gone to trial.\n\nUsually, Chief Guido said, current corruption cases are against individuals. ''We had an officer who stole $38 worth of checks from a prisoner in a station house, and used them to pay his electric bill,'' the chief recalled.\n\nAs for the schemes against the department itself, police computers check sick leave, military and overtime reports, flagging suspicious forms. Easy Arrests for Overtime\n\n''Collars for dollars'' is another abuse the department looks for. According to Chief Guido, an officer makes an easy arrest at the end of his shift - a prostitute, for example - knowing that he will get overtime as he waits to process the suspect.\n\nOften, he said, these ''collars for dollars'' are made by officers nearing retirement, who want the overtime to inflate their final salary because that salary figure is used to compute their retirement pay.\n\n''We're more than willing to pay overtime if the officer is processing a suspect in a serious crime,'' the chief said. ''But we know he can make a prostitute bust or a small drug buy any time.''\n\nMr. Kriss said there were no figures on the number of officers disciplined for overtime abuse. As for sick leave, Daniel Ryan, who coordinates the police health services, said supervisors now made spot checks of suspicious cases, visiting the officer at his home. Officers who have been out for more than a week must be examined by one of the department's doctors, or present a report from a private physician.\n\nMr. Ryan said that in 1980 about 14 officers were suspended for sick-leave abuse. Most of the 52 officers convicted last year of fraudulently filing for military leave took two or three days of the spurious leave and lost vacation days as a penalty, Chief Guido said. Three others who took even more time off were suspended.",

WPI published a scientific paper this past spring, and it showed that results were the same for all the gas can brands WPI tested.\n\n\u201cCriteria for flame propagation to the inside of a portable gasoline container have been determined for fuel storage and pouring scenarios,\u201d the paper stated. \u201cExtremely small gasoline volumes and/or low ambient temperatures produce conditions inside the PGC [portable gasoline container] that may allow flame propagation to occur.\u201d\n\nThe WPI scientists found that these conditions present the highest risks for explosions inside the cans: a very small volume of gasoline inside the can \u2013 a few teaspoons; cool temperatures; and tilting the gas can at a 42 degree angle, a common angle for pouring.\n\nRangwala and graduate student Brian Elias both told NBC News that the industry group had asked them to test whether plastic gas cans presented an explosion hazard, and that their test results indicated the cans do pose a hazard, under these limited conditions. NBC News asked Rangwala and Elias to replicate the tests it had conducted for the industry group, under the same conditions, with NBC News cameras present.\n\nThe WPI scientists tested five separate 5-gallon gas cans filled with a tiny amount of gasoline \u2013 30 milliliters. The gas vapor mixtures inside each of the cans ignited when an open flame was held under the open spout of the can, which was positioned at a pouring angle. Each time, a fireball burst through a sheet of aluminum foil covering a square hole that Elias had cut in each can, so that the force of an ignition would \u201cvent\u201d from the can in a controlled direction. For safety reasons, WPI did not allow unvented uncontrolled ignitions.\n\nAsked what the tests showed, Rangwala said, \u201cIt basically tells us that there is an issue with the gas cans \u2026 and it needs to be addressed.\u201d\n\nThe federal government\u2019s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives conducted its own tests of plastic gas cans at its Fire Research Laboratory in Maryland in December 2010 as part of a criminal investigation involving a father whose six-year-old daughter had died of injuries sustained after he poured diesel fuel onto a burning fire pit and his daughter became engulfed in flames.\n\nATF tested various mixtures of diesel and gasoline, as well as gasoline alone, and found that cans containing higher amounts of gasoline than WPI tested also experienced ignitions of gas vapor mixtures from inside the cans, when an open flame was held beneath the open spout. According to the ATF\u2019s lab report on those tests, those combustions caused the cans to expulse \u201cjets\u201d of flame between 1 and 3.5 meters long \u2013 approximately 3 to 7.5 feet. In those tests, the cans\u2019 sides appear to be supported by a harness and did not rupture\n\nScientists hired by plaintiff\u2019s attorney Diane Breneman, who has represented more than 30 alleged victims of gas can incidents, found that \u201cexplosions of gasoline stored in commercially available PPGCs [portable plastic gas cans] can and do occur under foreseeable conditions when their [gas vapor mixture] concentration is within the flammable range.\u201d The tests, by Berkeley Engineering and Research in California, showed that 22 of 58 trials involving ignition of fuel from inside gas cans resulted in the explosions inside the cans.\n\nRangwala said that scientific proof of the existence of an explosion hazard should not lead to the conclusion that consumers stop using plastic gas cans.\n\n\u201cIf there is the right kind of education given to the consumer related to the situation,\u201d Rangwala said, \u201cthe hazard can be avoided.\u201d Just as consumers avoid hazards while driving cars, or using kitchen stoves.\n\nWilliam Moschella, an attorney for the Portable Fuel Container Manufacturers Association, a trade group of plastic gas can manufacturers, says that today gas cans \u201care very safe.\u201d He told NBC News that most alleged incidents of internal can explosion have involved consumer misuse \u2013 such as pouring gasoline on a fire. He argued that all the incidents more likely have resulted from vapor explosions occurring outside the cans, and asserted that no one has proven in court that an explosion incident resulted from an ignition inside a can.\n\n\u201cThis is really only occurring in a laboratory environment,\u201d Moschella said. \u201cWe haven't seen a case where that has been demonstrated.\u201d He also said that the ATF tests \u201cdid not demonstrate internal combustion in a can,\u201d and that laboratory tests do not represent \u201ca real life situation that we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear at all that what is occurring in the real world, in real life, is that gas cans are exploding.\u201d\n\nMore from NBC News Investigations:\n\nFollow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook\n\nRead and vote on readers' story tips and suggested topics for investigation or submit your own.",

    "text": "With investors fleeing from the corporate bond market, this seems an odd time for Microsoft to be borrowing money, but the software maker is planning to do just that, taking advantage of its status as one of the tech sector's bluest blue chips.\n\nOn Monday the software company authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion, while it also announced it was returning capital to shareholders via a $40.0 billion stock buyback and an 18.2% increase in its quarterly dividend, to 13 cents a share.\n\nThe company also stated that it has completed its previous $40.0 billion stock repurchase program. Microsoft (nasdaq: MSFT - news - people ) said it has returned more than $115.0 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends over the last five years.\n\nMicrosoft bucked the downward trend on Wall Street Monday, rising 47 cents, or 1.9%, to $25.62. At that price, it has a market value of $233.2 billion, so the buyback accounts for 17.2% of its capitalization. At its price, the new dividend provides a yield of 2.0%.\n\nThe software maker said it has established a $2 .0 billion commercial paper program. It intends to use the proceeds from any debt financings for general corporate purposes, including funding for working capital and the stock repurchases.\n\nAlso on Monday Hewlett-Packard (nyse: HPQ - news - people ) announced it plans to buy back up to $8.0 billion more of its own shares. The maker of computers and printers said the new program was in addition to an $8.0 billion authorization approved in November. As of July 31, about $3 billion remained under that program.\n\nAthletic shoe and clothing maker Nike (nyse: NKE - news - people ) said on Monday that it planned to repurchase an additional $5 billion of its own stock over four years. The company said the new buyback would start after the completion of its current four-year, $3 billion program, which was approved in June 2006.\n\nThe companies are all reacting to the sliding stock market, which they are indicating has knocked their shares to levels that make it more worthwhile for them to buy their own stock than to invest in expansion or in acquistions. But the Microsoft announcement had some interesting elements, including the news that it would seek to raise funds in the debt market. The company does not currently have any bonds outstanding.\n\nCrowell, Weedon analyst James D. Ragan said that although Microsoft has plenty of cash and doesn't need to tap the debt markets, it may be able to borrow at lower rates than the interest it earns. Also, Ragan said, Microsoft may be ensuring the debt authority is in place for the future but may not plan on using it immediately. \"It will be interesting to see how much of the debt they really use,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Moody's put triple-A gradings on Microsoft's credit. That top-level rating means that Microsoft can borrow money at lower interest rates than most other companies. \"The company\u0092s strong credit quality coupled with investors\u0092 current appetite for high-quality paper provides a unique opportunity for the company to establish its first-ever commercial paper program and enhance its capital structure,\u0094 said George Zinn, treasurer of Microsoft.\n\nBut with money market funds, which were considered a safe bet on Wall Street, getting a shake up last week, it seems like an odd time for Microsoft to run to the debt markets, especially commercial paper.

Men who scaled the face of adversity and liberated Europe from fascism and nazism. Women like CPT Griest, LT Haver, MAJ Jaster who rewrote the narrative and challenged the status quo to prove themselves worthy of being called Rangers. The third is my future. Shortly after leave, I will report to FT. Rucker to start flight school. Knowing that one day I will be a pilot is humbling beyond words.

    "text": "In March, international pop icon Pharrell Williams released the album GIRL. Now, he's opened a new exhibition at Galerie Perrotin in Paris with the name, which is meant to engage with gender and its standing in the art world. Williams and gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin have known each other for eight years, but this is the first time an exhibition has come out of their partnership.\n\nThe show claims to \"celebrate women who are above all free, liberated by artists and their boundless, unfettered imagination\". And there are some powerful and empowering pieces. Those include works by Cindy Sherman (a 1982 C-print self-portrait in which she's draped in pink terrycloth), Marina Abramovi\u0107 (posed with artist Ulay in a still from their performance, in which a bow loaded with an arrow is pointed at her heart), Yoko Ono's 1964 Cut Piece (a still from her performance in which she invited the audience to snip her clothes off), and Sophie Calle's The Breasts (a black-and-white self-portrait that shows her naked chest, accompanied by a text about her late development). Each is a maestro of the art world; each artist's work is commanding, stunning, and makes sense in the context of an exhibition that intends to examine feminine identity.\n\nBut the show fails otherwise in so many ways. Ashok Adic\u00e9am, senior adviser at the gallery, notes of the ratio of just 18 female artists to 19 male: \"It's almost perfect parity between men and women artists, minus one woman.\" A symbolic statement: almost-perfect parity is pointedly not parity.\n\nSome of the artworks confront this knottiness head on. The collective Guerrilla Girls tackle the issue most explicitly, with graffiti announcing discomfiting statistics: \"Less than 4% of exhibited artists are women but 76% of nudes are female.\" Agn\u00e8s Thurnauer's painting is a none-too-coy restructure of patriarchy, in which a reproduction of Courbet's The Origin of the World is plastered over with feminised names of French male artists (Francine Picabia, Jeanne Dubuffet, Eug\u00e9nie Delacroix). Artist Dan Firman's Caroline addresses female marginalisation with a startling sculpture of a woman propped against a wall. Her silhouette is burrowing facelessly on to a piece of green fabric, as if she's ducking for cover or being punished: words that certainly encapsulate the female experience in art for much of history.\n\nThere are also pieces that say much less about female identity than about the showmanship of putting an international pop icon on the masthead. Rob Pruitt's Ikea couch graffitied with Pharrell doodles, or Daniel Arsham's Future Pharrell sculpture based on a mould of the man himself, are nothing more than shrines. They are the GIRL of the album, and it's a shame the two concepts get muddled.\n\nBut the real shame comes in the form of a Terry Richardson photograph. The image is a slice of girl shown from belly button to upper thigh, a chocolate heart dangling in front of her vagina with the words \"Eat Me\" scrawled in pink. Even if one were to repress the allegations that the photographer is a loathsome sexual predator, the image is a baffling inclusion.\n\nPerhaps it was a purposefully incendiary choice? Apparently not. \"Terry has been a friend of the gallery for a long time,\" Perrotin says breezily during a tour of the show. \"We could have selected an image that is, how can I say this, 'easier', less 'ambiguous' \u2026 this is a vision of women that exists, and is represented. He's a photographer that's very important.\" He continues: \"We're behind him. He's a very good guy.\"\n\nAt the press opening, I confronted Pharrell about this. Wearing a large hat that now sums up his whole style, plus a smiley-face T-shirt, he was personable and deferential. \"He has his own expression \u2026 What we were trying to accomplish with this project was to house many different facets of women,\" he said. \"This was meant to be a democracy, where people could contribute their views as long as we didn't see it as being outside of what we were trying to do \u2026 We want people to talk about these issues; we want to spark conversation.\" Then, peculiarly, he continued: \"Just because you're a good girl doesn't mean you don't have naughty thoughts\" \u2013 as if naughty behaviour were somehow in question, rather than misogyny. (The issue was all the more complicated because, in fact, Richardson was Pharrell's wedding photographer.) Perrotin's tone differed: \"I saw [Terry Richardson] on many occasions doing photoshoots, and it's a real big party all together; I promise you the woman part of the photoshoot doesn't look a victim of anything.\"\n\nAfter the press conference, Pharrell approached me to say he appreciated my question. Perrotin approached me mere moments afterwards to tell me the Richardson allegations were fabricated.\n\nIt's one thing to talk about how women are portrayed, but it's another when you contextualise that. As Perrotin himself said, his gallery currently represents 17% female artists \u2013 an upgrade from the recent 14%. (\"We're getting better,\" he said proudly) This means that, from among 83% of male artists \u2013 and 100% of all artists possible \u2013 this was a selection deemed worthy of representing women, and generating conversation about women. Richardson's picture not only depicts women in a demeaning way, but is taken by a man accused of abuse and intimidation in real life. For GIRL to include this is all the more absurd in the light of the proclaimed \"almost-perfect parity\".\n\nThe incredible artists in this group show deserve their dues. But it is a bewildering, heartbreaking blindspot that Richardson is deemed worthy of inclusion. Curation is above all concerned with choices of taste and representation, and including Richardson undercuts any constructive narrative the show could bring to a much needed spotlight of the role of women in art. There can be no progress in the art world when resting on work full of misogyny shoddily disguised as provocation.",

    "text": "Are you ready for one of the best-kept secrets of the job search process? Unless the person doing the hiring has previously worked in the exact role he's trying to fill, a fair amount of the job description is guesswork.\n\nThink about it: Hiring managers have to write a description that will simultaneously entice people to apply and ward off those who wouldn\u2019t qualify for an interview. Also, haven\u2019t you heard stories of a person who \u201cmet all of the qualifications\u201d being passed over in the final stages for someone who \u201cseemed like a better fit?\u201d Probably so \u2014 because a company would much rather hire the candidate with two years of experience who seems like she could hit the ground running than someone with the requisite five years who failed to demonstrate strong communication skills.\n\nSo what\u2019s a job seeker who doesn\u2019t quite meet all the requirements in a position description to do? How can you tell the non-negotiable requirements from the ones you could compensate for with your other awesome skills? And \u2014 more importantly \u2014 how do you broach the subject in your cover letter?\n\nRead on for your three-step plan.\n\nNotice that I didn't suggest asking, \"Do you want the job?\" or even, \"How much do you want the job?\" Honestly, those questions are irrelevant. It doesn't matter how passionate you are about working in a foreign language \u2014 if the job requires translating documents, and you're only conversational, you're not qualified. Similarly, it doesn't matter how fascinating you find a company: You shouldn't apply for a job running its website if you don't have any of the technical skills required.\n\nInstead, read through the job description and try to get a sense of what someone in the role would do each day. In your mind, break out \"public relations experience\" into writing press releases, pitching media and representing a brand. Think of \"writing experience\" as the ability to write concisely, persuasively and with proper grammar.\n\nAfter you've worked through the job description in this way, you'll have a more accurate sense of what you have to offer versus what skills you may be lacking.\n\nSome requirements are listed because they \"sound good.\" For example, I once edited a job description to remove the words \"from a prestigious university\" from after \"bachelors degree.\" (Yes, sadly, this a true story \u2014 someone on the team had thought those words would make the job seem impressive. Moreover, what was the person in charge of hiring going to do \u2014 purchase the latest copy of U.S. News & World Report) Occasionally, ridiculous phrasing happens to good descriptions because someone on the team thinks it \"sounds good,\" but that's no reason not to apply.\n\nAnother way companies flub the job description (read: scare off qualified candidates) is by listing requirements for a \"dream applicant\" \u2014 e.g. a laundry list of advanced computer skills for a job that primarily requires hands-on interaction with kids. But truthfully, companies aren't going to stall the hiring process until the dream applicant saunters in \u2014 solid, qualified applicants (like you!) get interviews, too. So, if there is a dumping ground of desired skills at the end of the description, see them as bonus skills, and focus your application on all of the core skills you do have.\n\nStill feeling nervous about ignoring the dream requirements? Think of the job description like a dating profile. Yes, I do have one friend whose husband speaks French, runs his own company, flies planes and volunteers with orphans oversees through a religious charity. But the rest of the group is more than happy with good partners who treat them right.\n\nSometimes the required skills you are missing don't fit into either of the above categories: While not a deal-breaker, they will factor into the job, and they're more than icing on the cake. First things first, remember this sage advice from Lily Zhang, and do not write the \"I know I don't have the right experience, but ... \" cover letter.\n\nZhang uses one of my favorite terms in her article: transferrable skills. Yes, I think the term \"transferrable skills\" has magical job-search powers that shouldn't be underestimated. Why? Because a critical piece of the application process is connecting the dots between the experience you already posses and that which the position calls for.\n\nJust make sure you don't over-reach for relevant experience. For example, do not try to explain how babysitting prepared you to be an executive assistant because you've previously been in charge of scheduling someone else's afternoon. Do focus on how lessons learned from prior experience would apply to a future role. (Think: Sales experience would prepare you for fundraising, because in each role you're asking someone to write a check or your obsessive desire to organize and schedule would be relevant to a job in operations.)\n\nThen, try this cover letter template, which focuses more on the skills you do have than the specific experiences you don't.\n\nIf you're interested in a role and could see yourself doing a great job, don't let a few missing qualifications stop you from applying. Follow the steps above, and then, wait and see. You may not be selected for an interview; but you could also be the best person for the job, and applying is the only way you'll know.\n\nThis article originally published at The Muse here",

    "text": "For the crew of the nuclear submarine USS Colorado to survive, cooler heads will have to prevail.\n\nAdmittedly, the prospects of TV survival for Last Resort (* * * out of four; ABC, Thursday, 8 ET/PT) grow a bit less likely next week, with an off-kilter second episode that crosses from hyperbole to hysteria. But Thursday's more-promising launch of this taut conspiracy/adventure carries off one of the season's riskiest and most intriguing premises in much more promising fashion -- and as promise is in limited supply this season, let's just assume the first outing is more indicative of where this sub is sailing.\n\nCreated by Karl Gajdusek and The Shield's Shawn Ryan, who knows something about risks and about keeping complicated conspiracy series afloat, Last Resort is a convincingly produced thriller with more than action on its mind.\n\nVIDEO: See a clip of 'Last Resort'\n\nAs a constitutional crisis roils Washington, American sub captain Marcus Chaplin receives a mysterious order to launch a nuclear weapon against Pakistan. When he asks for a more formal confirmation, his sub is attacked by our own Navy -- forcing him and his crew to seek refuge at a remote island until they can figure out who is behind the conspiracy and how they can prove they're heroes rather than traitors.\n\nThat's a lot for one pilot to ask, as it requires us to accept that some rogue arm of our government would nuke Pakistan and attack one of our own subs while also asking us to believe that one man could persuade his crew to follow him into exile.\n\nWhile the first part is still up for debate, the second hurdle proves to be easily surmounted. All it took was turning the captain's role over to Andre Braugher, a terrifically capable actor who exudes such wry intelligence and steely authority, you immediately believe that most of his men and women would follow him anywhere.\n\nWill we? Well, it helps that he's getting strong support from Scott Speedman, who is making a welcome leading-man return to TV as Marcus' second in command, and that many of his adventures will play out against a lush landscape (with Hawaii supplying visual splendor, as it did for Lost).\n\nThe show also has a wide range of stories at its command: the mystery playing out in Washington; the internal fights among the crew; the split opinions of the islanders; and Marcus' chess game with his adversaries. And don't discount the appeal of that sub, which adds a high-tech edge of claustrophobia.\n\nStill, this is a show walking a tightrope, and next week it falls off, as the relative restraint of Thursday's pilot is thrown over for an overdose of melodrama. Too many performances become too broad (whether it was his choice or the director's, the last thing this show needs is Robert Patrick chewing the scenery as the sub's master chief), and too much of what happens in Washington raises concerns that the conspiracy plot is going to spiral out of control, as has happened in so many other shows.\n\nIf you want us to stay onboard, you'd better calm the waters.",

    "text": "For many, the arrest of seven top officials at FIFA, soccer's global governing body, on U.S. federal corruption charges was a long time coming. The world may love the beautiful game more than any other, but the sport's main administrative organization is widely perceived as being bloated and rapacious. Its head, FIFA President Sepp Blatter \u2014 who was not among those arrested \u2014 rules like a sovereign monarch, undeterred by hostile public opinion.\n\nHere's what you need to know about FIFA's enormous power and its terrible reputation.\n\nIn 1904, the Federation Internationale de Football Association was founded by a group of Frenchmen seeking to form an umbrella organization for the sport's various national bodies. Like a lot of international organizations, it was initially a European club and slowly expanded to other corners of the globe.\n\nIts mission throughout has been to help support the development of the game and organize international competitions. FIFA also gives guidance on the rules and management of the sport.\n\nEarly on, rivalry with the International Olympic Committee eventually led to FIFA holding its first World Cup \u2014 in Uruguay in 1930. The tournament was small, invitation only, and barely discussed in Britain, the birthplace of the sport. That soon changed. The epic tournaments now staged under FIFA's aegis every four years are the most anticipated and watched events on the planet \u2014 and a huge, money-spinning bonanza for FIFA itself.\n\nThe World Cup, argues British soccer historian David Goldblatt, is perhaps one of the greatest \"occasions during which humanity can be an imagined community,\" united by the fits and starts of 22 men in shorts chasing after a ball. The 1998 World Cup in France, for example, had a mind-boggling cumulative audience of 37 billion people.\n\n[20 World Cup goals that changed history.]\n\nWhat began as a genteel, voluntary club now functions like a pantomime United Nations \u2014 indeed, there are more FIFA member associations than member states in the U.N. General Assembly. It has its own dreamy, utopian rhetoric of international equality, prosperity and development, to boot. Here is a FIFA video on how the institution works:\n\nSix regional confederations \u2014 roughly the world's continents \u2014 feed into the overall organization of the game. The FIFA Congress, comprised of delegates from around the world, elects the organization's president in elections held at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. The president and the heads of regional confederations are part of FIFA's executive committee, the organization's main decision-making body. It's this committee that votes on which country gets to host the World Cup.\n\nThe advent of television and marketing rights, the commercialization of everything, and the unprecedented global obsession with soccer all spurred FIFA's evolution from a tiny, amateur operation into a multibillion-dollar industry. FIFA gets to be the guardian of world soccer on trust, and therefore has to do very little to see its own coffers swell.\n\nIt places much of the financial burden of staging the World Cup on the host country \u2014 last year's tournament in Brazil prompted mass protests by Brazilians furious that vast sums of taxpayer money were being spent on stadiums rather than much-needed infrastructure, hospitals and schools. Yet FIFA, which as a technically nonprofit institution pays few taxes, raked in an estimated $4 billion from the 2014 World Cup, mostly from TV deals and corporate partnerships. (That money is meant to trickle down \u2014 FIFA claims it spends $550,000 on worldwide soccer development every day.)\n\nThis set-up is a breeding ground for the \"rampant, systemic and deep-rooted\" corruption cited by U.S. authorities Wednesday, as well as what fuels the elaborate networks of patronage that link the sport's top administrators with officials in national soccer associations. The individuals arrested are accused of taking bribes and kickbacks from various private firms in the bidding for lucrative soccer-related contracts, which include deals tied to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nAllegations of bribery still surround FIFA's decision to award Russia and Qatar the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, respectively. The Qatar bid, in particular, drew a furious backlash, with critics pointing to the tiny Persian Gulf emirate's appalling record on workers' rights and its muzzling of press freedoms.\n\nThe Post's Marissa Payne details the charges facing nine FIFA officials in a round of indictments from the U.S., and delves into why FIFA's president Sepp Blatter is not facing charges. (Nicki DeMarco and Marissa Payne/The Washington Post)\n\nDoes this mean FIFA will change?\n\nProbably not, at least if it's left to its own devices. FIFA has already indicated that the status of Russia and Qatar's World Cup bids are not in question. Last year, it issued a report clearing itself of any wrongdoing in the bidding process, though a lawyer who was part of the investigation subsequently claimed that the report \"contains numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations.\"\n\nThe ability of FIFA as an institution to shake off criticism is best embodied by Blatter himself, a man variously described as \"the dark prince of football\" and \"the most successful non-homicidal dictator of the past century,\" as my colleague Cindy Boren notes.\n\nBefore the arrests, Blatter was poised to comfortably win reelection this week to another term as FIFA president. In 2011, his chief rival, Mohammad bin Hammam, saw a promising election campaign derailed by corruption allegations. Blatter emerged unscathed. He has held the top post since 1998.\n\nIt's unclear how much deeper the U.S. and Swiss-led investigations may go, and to what extent they may shake up FIFA's governance structure or spur boycotts or wider protests against FIFA.\n\n\"Soccer\u2019s leaders survive in part because until very recently, the world has lived under the illusion that soccer is not a matter for politics and thus for serious public debate,\" wrote Goldblatt, the soccer historian, in 2011. \"They are wrong. No practice is more global than soccer.\" The resulting investigations into FIFA's corruptions may well prove that.\n\nQatar to build seven \"cities\" for World Cup workers\n\n20 World Cup goals that changed history\n\nIf England's top soccer clubs were historical empires\n\nMap: How English soccer teams rule the world\n\nIshaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

He had a hard time knowing when to be serious,\" said McKeon, recalling Marriott as a prankster who booby-trapped doors with water buckets.\n\nHis dark good looks also made him popular.\n\n\"I remember that girls were chasing after him even back then,\" McKeon said.\n\nIn his junior year, he jetted off to England and France for 10 days with his school chums. In the classroom, he had trouble buckling down.\n\n\"I know he had problems with studying and that he struggled a lot academically,\" said ex-classmate Robert Petty.\n\nCollege wasn't in the cards. After graduation, he went to Paris to break into modeling, but was back in Virginia within a year.\n\n\"It didn't pan out for him,\" said Kathy Keeny, a Virginia Beach photographer who met Marriott when he returned from Europe looking for work.\n\nKeeny and fashion editor Kim Wadsworth set him up with his first paid gig, four shoots at $50 a pop. But the strapping stud seemed more interested in beef than beefcake.\n\n\"He said, 'Man, you guys should try the steak fajita. I wish I could have one right now,'\" Keeny remembers.\n\n\"He likes hanging out, drinking beer, watching football and working construction,\" Wadsworth said. \"Just a regular guy.\"\n\nA little too regular for Tanya Tyrrell, 30, who dated Marriott briefly about seven years ago when he was working for his godfather's construction firm in Virginia Beach.\n\n\"He's a really nice guy with a good heart, but he can't hold a conversation,\" Tyrrell said.\n\n\"A little flighty is a nice way of putting it. I guess you could say he's two wings short of a bucket.\"\n\nMarriott had no trouble meeting women.\n\n\"In Virginia Beach, he didn't go unnoticed. If he walked into a bar, women would walk right up to him,\" Tyrrell said. \"But once you started talking to him, it was like, 'Never mind.'\"\n\nMarriott's striking looks didn't go unnoticed by the fashion world, either.\n\nHe sent his pictures around New York, and a premier agency, Click, liked what it saw. They signed him in 1994.\n\nHis chiseled features caught the eye of Bruce Weber. He also worked for Macy's, Calvin Klein and catalogues, said Click President Joey Grill.\n\nHe lived in the Click models' apartment on W. 68th St. and worked as a doorman at the Paramount Hotel between shoots.\n\nEver the practical joker, he would call the Click offices using fake voices and names, and tell people he was the heir to the Marriott hotel fortune.\n\n\"He was one of the most delightful, funny, charming guys I ever represented,\" said his booker, Jules Birnbaum.\n\nBut his 6-foot-5 frame was an impediment to fashion work, and after two years, Marriott quit Manhattan for Los Angeles to give acting a try.\n\nModeling left \"a bad taste in my mouth,\" Marriott told the Daily News.\n\nHis success on the West Coast was more modest. He worked construction, sculpted his body at Gold's Gym in Venice, Calif., and went on auditions.\n\nIn March 2000, he landed a part as \"Mover No. 1\" on \"Days of Our Lives.\"\n\nThe next year he pocketed $1,000 to pose in racy underwear - gladiator briefs, anyone? - for the California Muscle catalogue.\n\nIn May 2001, he enrolled in classes at Ultimate University, a $125-a-month school for wanna-be professional wrestlers, using the nickname Duke Elder.\n\n\"After a few months, we put him on scholarship because he was one of the four or five most natural guys I'd ever met,\" said coach Rick Bassman.\n\nFor seven months, his schedule was building-demolition by day and smackdowns by night.\n\n\"He had some financial struggles, but he wasn't on the brink of poverty,\" Bassman said.\n\nHis shot at stardom in the squared circle was cut short by a bigger break, when he met a producer for \"Joe Millionaire\" at a Christmas party in 2001.\n\nThe popularity of the show has fueled speculation that the audience is somehow being hoodwinked, along with the women on the show, that Marriott may be hiding assets. Rumors of his background have floated onto Internet discussion groups and radio talk shows.\n\nFox says it didn't pay Marriott for his work on \"Joe Millionaire,\" where he tries to con 20 women into believing he's a multimillionaire aristocrat with a castle in the French countryside.\n\nWhich could explain why he showed up for work at R.B. Holt Inc., a construction firm in Capistrano Beach, five days after the first episode aired.\n\nHolt office manager Amy Houlihan said that after his run at reality TV, Marriott wanted a dose of actual reality. \"I think he just wanted to get back to work.\"",

    "text": "Marc Bauer is not your typical French chef: He does not finish sauces with two grams of butter or create soups that are 20 percent cream.\n\nSo is Bauer, who was born and raised in Alsace, France, a calorie-counting, flavor-sacrificing chef?\n\nBauer, who is now based in New York City, along with an estimated 100 million other Americans, suffers from acid reflux . Rather than abandon rich, savory ingredients, Bauer teamed up with Dr. Jamie Koufman, the director of the Voice Institute of New York and professor of Otolaryngology at New York Medical College, to create delicious recipes that will not upset the digestive tract of those who suffer from acid reflux. They compiled these recipes into Dropping Acid: The Reflux Diet Cookbook & Cure.\n\nThe layout of this cookbook is both culinary and educational, with 70 of the 200 pages dedicated to information on acid reflux, including things to avoid, items to enjoy and even a three page chart of pH levels found in common foods, vegetables and condiments. At the bottom of each recipe is a notes section where Bauer provides technical, cooking gems. Bauer stressed that in all of the recipes, he uses simple ingredients, which are available to all people, from New York City to the Midwest.\n\nAcid reflux occurs when the acidic contents of the stomach pass up into the esophagus, and the sphincter muscle (the barrier between the two) has a defect, so it is unable to block the acid.\n\nCauses of acid reflux can include, but are not limited to: a sphincter having low pressure, pregnancy, hiatal hernia and obesity.\n\nDoctors often prescribe proton pump inhibitors like Nexium or Pepcid to treat the condition, but sometimes surgery or lifestyle changes are needed.\n\n\u201cI don't like medications,\u201d Bauer confessed. \u201cThat was one of my interests in working with Drs. Stern and Koufman on this cookbook. I'm really not for using medication, but my life is stirring around food, fresh ingredients, quality ingredients.\u201d\n\nBauer remembered as a kid in France feeling as if acid was in his throat after eating certain foods high in fat, like smoked pork or Bavarian cream pie, but he had never heard of acid reflux.\n\n\u201cNow in the past few years, what I feel is more like a coughing after eating,\u201d Bauer explained. \u201cI cough, and you would think, \u2018Oh, I swallowed something wrong,\u2019 and then it will stop after a while.\u201d\n\nKoufman said the symptoms of acid reflux are more than heartburn and indigestion for some.\n\n\u201cHaving the sensation of a lump in their throat, hoarseness, chronic cough, difficulty swallowing, sore throat and sometimes even sinus and asthma can have reflux as its primary cause,\u201d Koufman said.\n\nAlthough foods that bring about acid reflux vary from person to person, some common triggers are onions, citruses, eggs, fatty meats, deep-fried foods, hot sauces and high-fat milk chocolate.\n\nIn addition, people who have acid reflux should steer clear from bottled and canned products because acid is added to help kill bacteria. Alcohol most likely will not cause acid reflux when consumed in moderation but timing must be taken into account.\n\nKoufman said that a glass of wine right before bed may trigger acid reflux, while a glass with dinner can go unnoticed.\n\nWhile writing the cookbook, she and Bauer measured the acidity of foods in order to modify, substitute, and limit acidic ingredients.\n\n\u201cIt's not a question of avoiding everything with acid,\u201d Koufman noted. \u201cThere's this concept called pH balancing, which is really new. This idea that we can use things that would typically be associated with reflux in our recipes and as long as the whole recipe is non acidic then we're OK.\u201d\n\nKoufman and Bauer substitute and balance foods in an innovative way, fusing culinary techniques with medical knowledge. A basic example Koufman provided was in terms of breakfast. If you enjoy fruits that are acidic, like strawberries, you can add them into your cereal because the milk is non-acidic.\n\nBauer described how to make a healthy, summer pea shooter with saut\u00e9ed porcini. First, rather than boil the peas, Bauer put fresh baby peas into a blender, along with chicken stock and a tablespoon of brown sugar. The chicken stock is a flavorful, fat and acid free ingredient and the blender creates a smooth, creamy texture, without the use of fatty ingredients. Another way\n\nBauer accomplishes both savory and healthy meals is \u201cpops of taste\u201d. In this recipe, porcini mushrooms are the bursts of flavor, saut\u00e9ed in butter but pat dry before added to the soup.\n\nRather than replicating a French soup containing 20 percent cream, Bauer adds six tablespoons of whole milk that accumulate to 2 percent fat.\n\n\u201cIt's unbelievable the response,\u201d Koufman said. \u201cI get letters every single day from patients; they say, \u2018thank you, I'm off my medications\u2019 or \u2018the medicine wasn't working\u2019. Every single day. And the recipes are great and the recipes are doable.\u201d",

Host Ryan Seacrest introduced the panel, while a giant screen featured montages of Tyler and Lopez's work.\n\nAs the show moves into its 10th season, only one judge from the original lineup, Randy Jackson, remained. Simon Cowell announced his departure earlier this year to move on to his new show \u201cThe X Factor.\u201d Judges Kara DiGuardi and Ellen DeGeneres also announced their departures in recent months.\n\nBy filling just two of the vacancies, \"American Idol\" is back to the three-judge panel that's been a mainstay for most of the show's run.\n\nWhether Lopez and Tyler can recapture the offbeat chemistry that Cowell shared with Paula Abdul, who left last year in a contract dispute, remains to be seen.\n\nTyler said he wanted to join the show because \"it's being a part of something much bigger than yourself. ...

    "text": "Imagine them both stroking a white cat, but Ed somehow getting it wrong. (Photo: Getty)\n\nHas Ed Miliband fallen and hit his head? Have his communications team collectively fallen over and hit their heads, in some outlandish spin-doctors' head-hitting accident? Has Len McCluskey sent round the Unite Leverage Team to pick the lot of them up, then drop them all on their heads from a very great height?\n\n\u2022 Benedict Brogan: Our free press is envied by other countries \u2022 Daniel Hannan: Stop referring to the CBI as \u2018British business\u2019 \u2022 James Delingpole: Wave a sparkler for the back-garden bonfire\n\nYesterday, after days of growing political fallout over the vote-rigging scandal, Labour finally issued a formal statement. The statement was drawn up after The Sunday Times had published the contents of over 1000 leaked emails to and from the local Unite official and CLP chair Stevie Deans, which threw a damning new light on the whole affair. It was issued after two witnesses who had supposedly withdrawn statements of wrongdoing in the constituency told numerous media outlets, including the BBC, that they had not in fact changed their statements at all. And it was issued after Alistair Darling, the former chancellor, said that, in the light of this new evidence, \u201cthere needs to be a proper inquiry, one that people have confidence in, people can see what happened \u2026 I think the problem with the last report was quite clearly it didn't have all the facts that are now available.\u201d\n\nYet after all that \u2013 the emails, the statements, the call from Alastair Darling \u2013 a Labour Party official spokesman sent out a formal press release, on Labour Party headed paper, that said the following: \u201cWe have not seen any new evidence to justify further action.\u201d It literally said that. \u201cWe have not seen any new evidence to justify further action.\u201d\n\nA thousand new emails have been released to a national Sunday newspaper. You can read about them here. They outline, in painstaking detail, how the Unite union attempted to rig the selection in Falkirk. How the union drew up plans to derail any investigation into its strategy. And how the Union itself drafted statements on behalf of witnesses that exonerated it of any wrongdoing. Yet apparently, this does not constitute \u201cnew evidence\u201d.\n\nLast week I asked a Labour spokesman whether there were plans to reopen the inquiry. He told me, on the record, that \u201cinformation has been passed to the police, and it\u2019s right and proper for us to wait and see how that investigation proceeds. Once it has been concluded we will make a judgment on whether further action is taken.\u201d Another Labour spokesman reiterated that line yesterday, saying that \"there is now a police inquiry going on into other issues around Falkirk and we will of course consider the outcome of that inquiry\u201d. But if there is \u201cno new evidence\u201d, what exactly is it that has been passed to the police? And what is it that Falkirk constabulary are investigating? The Great Train Robbery? The disappearance of Shergar?\n\nLabour\u2019s hear-no-evil, see-no-evil statement contained another fantastical line. It said, \u201cthe General Secretary of the Labour Party approached Mrs Lorraine Kane today after reports in the Daily Mail. She said today she stands by a sworn affidavit given to us on 2nd September. It was that affidavit which was part of the reason that led the Labour Party to conclude there was insufficient evidence to proceed with our inquiry\u201d. Yet the Sunday Times emails clearly show that very affidavit was in fact drawn up by Unite's own legal department, then handed to Stevie Deans and finally handed to Lorraine Kane to sign. It is there in black and white. Yet to the Labour Party, this constitutes \u201cno new evidence\u2019.\n\nWhen I saw Labour\u2019s statement I seriously wondered for a moment whether the party has started to take communications advice from the Police Federation. I have seen political scandals where attempts have been made to hide evidence. I have seen political scandals where there have been attempts to manipulate or doctor evidence. But I can\u2019t recall a political scandal where a party\u2019s defence has literally been to pretend that evidence printed in every newspaper, discussed openly on hundreds of radio and television outlets, and raised publicly at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions doesn\u2019t actually exist at all.\n\nThis is the extent of the ludicrous, cack-handed mess Labour has somehow managed to get itself into. This morning it is actually pretending the emails, redrafted witness statements and discussions about how to undermine the initial internal inquiry and flat-out rigging of the Falkirk selection are all illusory. The Sunday Times made them up. This newspaper made them up. The BBC made them up. Alistair Darling made them up. There is \u201cno new evidence\u201d.\n\nThere is an old saying in politics that if you want to find the genuine rationale for any political crisis its best to look for the cock-up, rather than the conspiracy. Miliband has somehow managed to combine the two. Falkirk has become a gold-plated Labour Party cock-up and a gold-plated Labour Party conspiracy.\n\nThere is new evidence. Not just some new evidence; masses of evidence. Thousands of emails jam packed full of the stuff. The police are investigating this non-evidence. The media are investigating this non-evidence. Now the time has come for Labour\u2019s leader to wake up, to tell his communications team to wake up, and announce Labour is going to investigate this non-evidence itself.\n\nWhen the Falkirk scandal broke, Miliband said \"Let nobody be in any doubt, there is only going to be one outcome to this: the Labour Party will act in a way that upholds the integrity of our party, the integrity of our party members and the integrity of ordinary trade union members\u201d. At the moment the outcome is tawdry, squalid mess.\n\nMiliband needs to clean it up. Fast.",

    "text": "DxO One is a standalone 20-megapixel camera that marries with your iPhone for a new kind of smartphone photography experience. What you might think of as the camera handle is actually the camera and the lighting plug-connected iPhone is the viewfinder.\n\nIt\u2019s DxO\u2019s way of sidestepping the iPhone\u2019s photo limitations, while still tapping into what\u2019s often best about iPhone photography.\n\nApple iPhone photography is already a pretty satisfying experience. Not only does the iPhone take great 8MP photos and 1080p video, but it\u2019s also the easy-to-use camera that\u2019s always in your pocket.\n\nEven so, camera pros and prosumers are invariably frustrated by the iPhone's limitations. The megapixel count is too low and the controls \u2014 aperture, shutter speed and ISO settings \u2014 are virtually non-existent. Just try capturing a decent picture of the moon at night with your iPhone and you\u2019ll see what I mean.\n\nWith the $599 DxO One, which goes on pre-order today, DxO takes image capture out of the iPhone's responsibilities and places it firmly in control of this tiny camera with DSLR-level chops.\n\nDxO is a well-known name in digital photography circles. The company provides image and video quality analysis for manufacturers and media outlets. It also makes a line of pro-level image-processing tools, and the company says its imaging tech is inside 300 million smartphones. This is the first time, though, the company has built consumer imaging hardware.\n\nThe DxO One camera is small and light enough to fit in one hand or your pocket. This shows it with the lens cover/power button slid down.\n\nAt 2.65 inches tall, almost an inch wide and about 2 inches deep, the DxO One fits in the palm of your hand. It\u2019s packed full of imaging technology, including a 1-inch images sensor, a tiny LED touchscreen on the back, a six-blade aperture iris and a six-element lens, but it weighs just 108 grams. It also features an 11.9mm focal length, which DxO says is equivalent to 32mm (in full frame).\n\nDespite its size, the all gray and plastic DxO One is not a fish-eyed action cam. Company executives told me it\u2019s designed for landscapes, portraits and, essentially, any image you might normally capture with a DSLR.\n\nThe DxO One Camera has a built-in lightning plug so you can plug it right into your iPhone.\n\nDxO designed the camera specifically to work with the Apple iOS ecosystem. You slide down the camera lens cover to turn on the device and an extra push down releases the embedded lighting port plug. The benefit of using the lighting port instead of connecting via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi is clear: Lightning has 10x the bandwidth of Wi-Fi, which means control access is instantaneous and your photos are almost instantly stored on the iPhone.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already pre-installed the free DxO software, the iPhone will recognize the camera as soon as it\u2019s plugged in, launch the app and turn the iPhone into a touch-screen viewfinder for the DxO One. In the brief demo I saw, this all worked smoothly.\n\nHere you can see the back of the DxO One camera with its touch screen and the image settings on the iPhone app.\n\nIt offers an impressive level of control, including shutter and aperture priority, full manual control and scene settings, all of which are in line with a decent DSLR. So you can adjust the f-stop up to F/11 and change the shutter speed from as fast as 1/8,000th of a second to as slow as 15 seconds. There\u2019s a live exposure meter on the screen so you can see when your settings will result in under and over exposed images.\n\nThe camera shoots in RAW by default, but will automatically output JPEGs as well, sending them directly to your iPhone\u2019s camera roll.\n\nSome of the best digital SLRs have adjustable viewfinders and you get pretty much the same effect with the DxO One. When it\u2019s attached to the iPhone, you can rotate the connector and iPhone 60 degrees in either direction. If you hold the camera above your head, you can rotate your phone so you can look up and still see the screen/viewfinder.\n\nThe camera even comes with a Selfie mode. To access it, you detach the iPhone, rotate it 180 degrees and plug it back into the DxO One\u2019s lighting plug. Now the camera and viewfinder are facing you.\n\nTaking a photo is easy. You can use the soft button on the screen, or two-stage physical button on the DxO One. The first light press focuses the camera and the full press takes the picture.\n\nNaturally, the DxO can shoot video, too. It outputs 1080p footage at 30 frames per second in standard mode and 720p at 120fps for slow-mo. Neither of these specs are particularly impressive when you consider all the 4K and 240fps cameras flooding into the market. Heck, even the iPhone itself can shoot 240fps.\n\nThe DxO also lacks a zoom. That was the big selling point of Sony\u2019s Lens Type cameras \u2014 devices that looked like nothing but zoom lens. They, too, attached to the iPhone and used the smartphone as a viewfinder, but were actually connected via Wi-Fi. The considerably larger cameras failed to connect with consumers.\n\nA DxO One Super RAW example image.\n\nDxO One, however, may have a better chance of attracting the prosumer market, especially when you take into account its RAW shooting capabilities. In fact, DxO ups the ante with a second RAW shooting mode called, naturally, Super RAW. Designed for extreme-low-light situations, Super RAW takes four RAW images and then compares them to intelligently remove the graininess that naturally occurs. The examples I saw were impressive.\n\nWhen the DxO ships in September, there may not be any accessories available, though the company said it is considering some. Plus, I noticed threading inside the DxO One lens that could accommodate lens attachments.\n\nOverall, the DxO One is an intriguing entry into the prosumer smartphone camera update market. It\u2019s a full-blown pro camera in its own right, but with the iPhone it becomes something more. $599 is on the high-end, but DxO bundles in all of its pro-level desktop software, including Connect, FilmPack and Optics Pro.\n\nI honestly can't wait to try it out.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Many of those telling lies are financial advisors whose income depends on their client\u2019s use of high-cost active management strategies. They view simple, low-cost passive strategies through index funds as bad for their business.\n\nI started out about 22 years ago as an investment professional monitoring and evaluating active managers. As a result of this experience, by the mid-1990s, I became an avid believer in what John Bogle, Charley Ellis, Burton Malkeil and many others had been saying for a long time. The fees in active funds are too high, the talent too scarce, and competition too intense for active managers to outperform indexing in the long-term. Ellis cleverly described the entire process as a loser\u2019s game.\n\nMy upcoming book, The Power of Passive Investing, provides summaries of exhaustive academic studies covering the active versus passive debate going back many decades. Every study in the book ends with the same conclusion; while a handful of active managers beat their benchmarks due to skill, it wasn\u2019t by much, and most didn\u2019t sustain that benchmark-beating performance for long. In addition, it\u2019s not possible to determine luck from skill or to pick skilled managers in advance. To make matters worse for investors, the success rate for a portfolio of funds drops precipitously as more active funds are added to the portfolio.\n\nWith the evidence overwhelmingly in favor of passive investing for the long-term, why won\u2019t more advisors admit these facts and shift their focus to advising clients on the benefits of index investing rather than making believe they\u2019re market gurus or trying to pick those who are? One reason \u2013 there\u2019s a lot more money to be made by keeping the lie alive. The fees and commissions earned through active investing are considerably higher than what should be earned by telling the truth about passive investing and charging a fair fee for this advice. Even those advisors who have switched can\u2019t bring it upon themselves to lower their own fee. See my recent article on High-Fee Passive Advisor Hypocrisy.\n\nBrokers in particularly are deeply set against index fund investing because they believe it\u2019s very bad for their revenue stream. Their efforts to sell costly actively-managed mutual funds have generated a lot of trash talk about low-cost index funds. The following is a list of 5 common lies spun by advisors who are dead-set against indexing.\n\nIndexing works because active investing can\u2019t work. The fees are too high, the opportunities too few, and the talent too scarce. Ignore the lies told by those people who earn a fat living selling the dream of market beating returns. You\u2019ll earn more money over your lifetime by creating and maintaining a low-cost, low-tax, low-turnover portfolio of index funds.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment\n\nLog in with your Forbes account",

    "text": "The baby bison that had to be put to death at Yellowstone National Park in May after tourists loaded it in the trunk of their car was not the first one to die after human interference tore apart its family.\n\nA similarly misguided rescue effort at Badlands National Park resulted in the death of a bison calf \u2014 only this time, it was a wildlife expert who was at fault. And the acting park superintendent approved the intervention, an investigation by the National Park Service\u2019s watchdog disclosed this week.\n\n[Baby bison dies after Yellowstone tourists put it in their car because it looked cold]\n\nThe report from Interior Department Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall said a supervisory natural resource specialist at the South Dakota park spotted a sickly calf by itself, somewhere on the property in May 2010.\n\nThe employee decided to take the animal home, presumably to care for it. But the bison later died, in all likelihood of whatever was ailing it in the park.\n\nThe decision to remove the animal from its habitat broke federal law, state law and Park Service policy, which prohibits interfering with wildlife, never mind taking an animal home. But the grave mistake by a park employee who should have known better was only made worse when the acting park superintendent at the time authorized the bison\u2019s removal.\n\n[Seriously, people, stay away from the bison]\n\nThe local police chief did not cite the natural resource specialist for what would have been a misdemeanor violation, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined prosecution, the inspector general\u2019s office said in an investigative summary of the case released Wednesday.\n\nThe report does not say whether the manager or acting superintendent were disciplined by the Park Service.\n\n[I saw the baby bison that tourists tried to rescue. Here\u2019s what you don\u2019t know about the story]\n\nPark Service spokeswoman Christine Powell said in a statement that the park is \u201creviewing the report.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the Office of the Inspector General bringing these issues to our attention,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAt Yellowstone, the tourists may not have known better when they saw a baby bison and decided it looked cold and needed to be rescued. They loaded the animal in the trunk of their car and drove it to a ranger station.\n\nBut the newborn calf had to be euthanized, Yellowstone officials said, because its mother had rejected it as a result of the \u201cinterference by people.\u201d Had the Badlands bison survived, it likely would have met the same fate.\n\nThe tourists were fined $110 for violating park regulations and their action was widely mocked online.\n\n[Bison selfies are a bad idea: Tourist gored in Yellowstone as another photo goes awry]\n\nMany humans who visit national parks \u2014 and apparently, some who work in the parks \u2014 tend to want to approach, feed, take selfies with or help rescue wildlife. But park officials warn us over and over that these interactions can be dangerous and are illegal.\n\nSince 1980, bison have been responsible for more animal-caused injuries to pedestrians in Yellowstone than any other species, including wolves and grizzly bears, our colleague Karin Brulliard has reported.",

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Cisco Systems is trying to pull off one of the toughest tricks in high technology, adapting a big legacy business to a vastly different future.\n\nCisco emerged from a pack of computer networking companies in the 1990s during the rise of the Internet and briefly became the most valuable company in the world. It still dominates the market for computer networking hardware, controlling 85 percent or more of some businesses.\n\nIncreasingly, however, customers want their technology suppliers to offer them sophisticated services, not just equipment, as they seek to better manage an Internet that connects not just computers, but also things like sensors and mobile devices.\n\nLike other tech giants, including Microsoft and Dell, Cisco is struggling to adapt to this new world.\n\nOn Wednesday, the company reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that grew 44 percent. Although that was more than Wall Street expected, John Chambers, the chief executive, warned of \u201ca challenging economic environment.\u201d\n\nErik Suppiger, an analyst with JMP Securities in San Francisco, said Cisco \u201cdid a good job managing costs, and keeping their margins up, but there\u2019s a lot of concern about what they can do to build revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuilding a cloud and wireless business eats into your traditional product lines,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a wireless laptop, you don\u2019t need a desktop computer connected to your office network.\u201d\n\nMr. Chambers, who has led Cisco for 18 years, is well aware of that problem, and he has spent much of the last decade devising ways to adapt Cisco. In his latest reinvention, he has cut much of its consumer business, and has refocused on selling large, complex products and services for telecommunications firms, big business and governments.\n\nCisco\u2019s latest ad campaign extols \u201cthe Internet of Everything,\u201d in which even trees are connected to scientists, to solve global warming, and cars talk to traffic lights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve broken away from the traditional players,\u201d Mr. Chambers said in an interview after the results were announced. \u201cThe pipeline is starting to fill.\u201d\n\nThere are indeed signs of progress, though it is unclear whether Cisco will prevail before Mr. Chambers retires in what he says will be two to four years. What may be his greatest task \u2014 building a software and services business distinct from its existing hardware business \u2014 is still in its early phase.\n\nCisco does appear to be garnering the sales and cash for such a move, however. As of Jan. 26, Cisco had a cash pile of over $46 billion, and some of the highest gross profit margins in high tech.\n\nIn the second quarter, Cisco, which is based in San Jose, Calif., had net income of $3.14 billion, or 59 cents a share compared with $2.18 billion, or 40 cents. Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.18 billion. Excluding certain items, Cisco earned 51 cents. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected Cisco to make 48 cents a share, on revenue of $12.06 billion.\n\nDespite the better-than-expected performance, Cisco shares retreated slightly in after-hours trading.\n\nWhile sales in Europe were down 6 percent, Cisco\u2019s sales grew in both Asia and the Americas. Newer businesses like video and cloud computing systems did well. Revenue from services, Mr. Chambers said, was now almost evenly divided between money from planning and installing traditional networks, and higher-value consulting contracts.\n\nMr. Chambers called video \u201cthe most intriguing area, not just because it will be 90 to 98 percent of the load\u201d of data packets on the Internet. \u201cIt changes business, health care, government, everything.\u201d",

    "text": "AUCTIONS held periodically by moving and storage companies to clear out unclaimed or impounded goods are a popular resource for people who traffic in things secondhand, like used-furniture sellers, people with booths at flea markets and, occasionally, antiques dealers. But anyone can attend these, and for the sharp-eyed, or the lucky, the right auction can be a treasure hunt of sorts, yielding items ranging from the welcome to the worthless.\n\n\"A lot of what we auction off is stored records of bankrupt companies,\" said Jack Fuchs, owner of Whitehall Storage in Manhattan. But interesting items do turn up, like good second-hand furniture, CD's, near-new televisions and computers.\n\nMoving and storage company auctions can be attractive for anyone looking for functional household items at modest cost. A box of old small appliances needing a cleaning can go for $15 or $20, for example.\n\nBut auction shopping is a far cry from visiting a department store or even a flea market. For example, lots tend to be enormous -- and bulky. Though moving companies sometimes sell matched items, like bedroom sets, in single lots, more often the bidding is for the complete contents of a 250-cubic-foot container.\n\nAnd at so-called mini-storage companies, where customers rent partitioned rooms the size of a walk-in closet or larger, bids are made for a room's entire contents.\n\nSales are almost always in cash. And buyers usually must pick up their purchases within five days.\n\nTaking possession can be a happy surprise or a shock, since bidders often buy some of their goods without seeing them. When bidding for a room at a storage company, for example, interested buyers receive an inventory sheet of the room's items. But since they are not allowed to enter the room or touch anything until after the auction, often all they see are items visible near the door.\n\nLegal considerations determine the rules and rituals of most moving and storage company auctions. After dispatching warnings to delinquent clients through certified mail and in local newspapers, moving and storage companies can sell the client's goods to help defray unpaid bills.\n\nAuctions occur when a company winds up with sufficient inventory to warrant a sale. For some companies, that can be every two or three months.\n\nThe best place to learn of sales is the auction listings of newspaper classified advertisements. Trade papers like the Arts & Antiques Weekly also publish auction notices. At an Auction House\n\nThough some sales are held on the moving or storage company's premises, others take place at auction houses, like Country Auctions, an eight-year-old concern in Long Island City, Queens. Much of Country Auctions' inventory comes from moving and storage companies, including Whitehall. Items are sold singly or in small lots, and visitors can view them an hour before sale. There is no admission fee.\n\n\"You never know what will be at an auction,\" said Ray Brachfeld, Country Auctions' owner, an auctioneer for 30 years.

But they can go for thousands of dollars.\n\nOccasionally, containers are broken up, with large items like bedroom sets sold separately. Most sales include mystery boxes. \"A lot may consist of six or seven boxes with just the top boxes open,\" Ms. Connelly said. \"So you see dishes in the top box but can't see the contents below.\" LIBERTY MOVING AND STORAGE , (212) 223-6440 or (516) 234-3000.

But anyone can attend these, and for the sharp-eyed, or the lucky, the right auction can be a treasure hunt of sorts, yielding items ranging from the welcome to the worthless.   \"A lot of what we auction off is stored records of bankrupt companies,\" said Jack Fuchs, owner of Whitehall Storage in Manhattan.

    "text": "Like Lucy with her football, forever enticing Charlie Brown to one more kick, Wall Street is waving at Main Street yet again and shouting, \"Have a little faith\u2014try me one more time.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average this month briefly crossed 14000, for the first time since the boom of 2007.\n\nFor the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the recent surge is even more historic. The S&P, which touched an ominous intraday low of 666 during the crash six years ago, has surpassed 1500. The first time it broke that barrier was April 2000\u2014the peak of the dot-com era bubble.\n\nSince then, the market has collapsed twice and recovered twice. Each time, the S&P 500 has made it just over the 1500 line before plummeting. Will this time be any better?\n\nThere are many on Wall Street who will tell you that yes, the third time's the charm. The economy is recovering, they say. Unemployment is falling, albeit slowly. Inflation is tame. Corporate America\u2014which is what you buy when you buy stocks\u2014has never been in better shape. Companies are loaded with cash and their earnings are strong.\n\nAnd stock prices at current levels look remarkably cheap on the most common metrics, they add. For example, the S&P 500 trades at just 13 times forecast per-share earnings for the next 12 months, which is slightly below historical averages.\n\nIf that doesn't convince you, they will add that stocks look especially cheap when compared with the alternatives. The interest rates on bonds are at historic lows. Ten-year Treasury bonds yield less than 2%, which is less than inflation. Cash pays a little over nothing at all.\n\nMain Street is warming to the idea. The Investment Company Institute, which represents the mutual-fund industry, reports that in the past few weeks the ordinary investor has started to return to the stock market. Mutual funds that invest in U.S. stocks are reporting net inflows, after years in which investors cashed out.\n\nBut whether Main Street is buying Wall Street's arguments is another matter. It is more likely that the average investor just can't resist the sight of a rising market, any more than Charlie Brown could resist the sight of Lucy holding a football.\n\nICI data show that in recent years Main Street investors have only jumped back into the market after a big run-up in prices\u2014such as in the spring of 2009 or early 2011.\n\nOver the longer term, numerous studies have found that Mom and Pop tend to have the market-timing skills that would have made the late P.T. Barnum jump for joy\u2014buying after the market is up and selling again after it has fallen. Investors sold heavily during the crash of 2008-09. They were selling all last year.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to view this market with caution\u2014yet again.\n\nWhile the economy certainly seems to be recovering, much of this has already been reflected in higher stock prices. And while U.S. stocks may appear inexpensive compared with current earnings, that may be an illusion. Economists say earnings have been artificially inflated, both by the Federal Reserve's actions to drive down interest rates and by the federal government's enormous budget deficits. Deficits give the economy a short-term shot in the arm, boosting demand for companies' products, while lower interest rates have allowed companies to borrow cheaply at what are, in effect, subsidized rates.\n\nWhat can you do if you think the market has topped out?\n\nWhen U.S. stock prices are measured against less-volatile yardsticks, they appear considerably less appealing. Yale University finance professor Robert Shiller measures stocks against average corporate earnings of the last decade, to smooth out short-term fluctuations. By this so-called Shiller or cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio, the market is now at 23 times earnings\u2014far above the historical average of 16 times, and a level usually associated with stock-market peaks, although the figure has been known to go higher.\n\nOther economists compare stock prices with the theoretical cost of rebuilding those companies from scratch and replacing all their assets, a measure known as \"Tobin's q,\" after the late economist James Tobin. By this indicator, too, U.S. stock prices are far above historical norms.\n\nHistorically, stocks bought at elevated levels on the Shiller price/earnings ratio or the Tobin's q and held for a decade have produced poor returns.\n\nStill others note an ominous recent coincidence. While Main Street investors have returned to the stock market in recent weeks, insiders\u2014such as corporate executives\u2014have suddenly started cashing out at a heavy rate.\n\nBen Inker, the head of asset allocation for Boston investment firm GMO, which manages $100 billion in assets, says U.S. stocks and bonds are both heavily overvalued at current levels. Based on some simple calculations, his firm fears that investors in the main U.S. stock indices, including the S&P 500, will be lucky to earn anything in real, inflation-adjusted dollars over the next seven years.\n\nWhere does this leave the investor? Bonds look worse than stocks. Cash, too, is earning nothing, but at least it won't go down in a crisis.\n\nMr. Inker suggests investors stick to the types of investment that look the least dangerous right now: Top-quality U.S. blue chips, such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) or Coca-Cola (KO), European and Japanese stocks and those in emerging markets. In all three areas, he says, one can find better valuations.\n\nIt's only one opinion, but Mr. Inker's firm was among the few to predict the slumps that followed 2000 and 2007\u2014and that also recommended buying stocks aggressively during the 2008-09 crash.\n\nMr. Inker believes the overall investment outlook today is even worse than it was in 2007, because even if stocks aren't quite as expensive now as they were then, bonds are more expensive. He fears the standard portfolio of 60% U.S. stocks and 40% bonds is actually likely to leave investors poorer, in real, inflation-adjusted dollars, over the next seven or so years.\n\nWrite to Brett Arends at brett.arends@wsj.com",

    "text": "But not everyone saw it like this. The northerners grew frightened. Some had grown fat on Western money in government, while others simply detested the Taliban for the same reasons we do. Last summer, Karzai sacked his anti-Taliban spy chief Amrullah Saleh to ease the way for talks. Saleh railed against this, insisting that \u201cthere must not be a deal with the Taliban. Ever\u201d. Along with other veterans from the Panjshir Valley in northern Afghanistan, he\u2019s emerged as a political force against reconciliation, drawing crowds of thousands with his denunciations of the Taliban as Pakistani stooges.\n\nRabbani\u2019s assassination is so dangerous precisely because it sharpens these fears of minority communities. The northern forces never disarmed, and they\u2019ve probably begun rebuilding their strength to prepare for the worst-case scenario. They would find willing sponsors. In the 1990s, Russia, Iran and India chipped in. Today, a richer and more ambitious India would hit back at the rise of Pakistani influence in Afghanistan that would result from any Taliban takeover. Delhi already sends billions of dollars, and probably sees Saleh and his allies as guarantors of Indian interests.\n\nIn short, a civil war is a distinct possibility. It would further destabilise Pakistan\u2019s fragile borderlands, and extinguish all hope of nation-building in Afghanistan. It\u2019s hardly surprising, then, that the US ambassador would prefer to focus on the Kabul traffic rather than intractable ethnic politics.\n\nIf the northerners are spooked by the prospect of a US withdrawal, why doesn\u2019t Washington stay in the country beyond 2014 and calm everyone\u2019s nerves? The problem is that this would paper over the cracks.\n\nWe were not fated to lose this war. It might have been possible to defeat the Taliban if we had enjoyed a reliable partner in Afghanistan, a reliable ally in Pakistan, and a political strategy that took the wind out of the insurgency\u2019s sails. Instead, we have a self-serving oligarchy in Kabul, a jihad-addicted Pakistani military across the border, and a political strategy that shows no understanding of our terrible bargaining position.\n\nThe overarching problem is that no party is interested in negotiations, because each is convinced it can win outright. Pakistan has arrested Taliban leaders who try to talk to us and continues to support groups, like the Haqqani Network, that kill British and American troops. The Afghan government, for its part, has expelled British diplomats who tried to talk to the Taliban. Last month, it leaked details of American meetings with a senior Taliban envoy, forcing him to flee.\n\nBoth the US and the Taliban have opted for killing each other\u2019s interlocutors, hardly a sound basis for diplomacy. The Americans argue that an aggressive campaign of night raids and assassinations allows us to negotiate from strength. In reality, it means that pragmatic older insurgents are replaced by ever-more radical diehards \u2013 those who may well have killed Rabbani.\n\nIf the Afghan government fails to reform itself, and negotiations lead nowhere, then the alternative is a gradual disintegration of the country. When Monty Python\u2019s Black Knight is altogether limbless, he concedes to Arthur, \u201cwe\u2019ll call it a draw\u201d. An Afghan draw would suit us. But our failure to lay the groundwork for this means that we\u2019re just as likely to wind up in stalemate.\n\nShashank Joshi is an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London",

    "text": "Pinnacle Foods, absent from mergers since its suitor walked away a year and a half ago, finally found a deal its shareholders can get excited about.\n\nPinnacle, the $5 billion maker of Birds Eye frozen vegetables and Vlasic pickles was slated to sell itself to Hillshire Brands last year for a 20 percent premium. But then poultry-and-meat giant Tyson Foods launched a bid for Hillshire and succeeded, leaving Pinnacle in the cold. While the company's shares had risen 31 percent since then through Monday, it's tough to see why. Like most mainstream foodmakers, Pinnacle's growth is weakening from a combination of tired brands and changing consumer tastes, particularly in the shift to foods billed as healthy and organic.\n\nTuesday, the foodmaker delivered some good news, though. It announced a $975 million takeover of Boulder Brands, a company that has capitalized on the increasing popularity of gluten-free and dairy-free foods and whose revenue is climbing faster than Pinnacle's. Boulder's products include things like vegan, non-GMO, lactose-free, egg-free, zero-trans-fat Earth Balance soymilk, kettle chips and Mindful Mayo, as well as Evol frozen meals and Smart Balance butter-like spreads. The deal will be accretive beginning next year.\n\nThrough the deal, Pinnacle is adding gluten-free baked goods and dairy-free spreads to its more conventional food products that aren't growing as quickly. Sales trends side by side:\n\nAt a price equal to about 29 times Boulder's trailing 12-month Ebitda, the valuation may look expensive when compared with other big food deals of the past few years in which the median multiple is less than half that, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But few of those involved young, fast-growing brands. For instance, ConAgra bought Ralcorp, an already established maker of private-label foods, for a far lower multiple of 12.5 times Ebitda -- and we know how that ended. And Diamond Foods agreed in October to buy Snyder's-Lance, largely a traditional snacks maker, for 18 times Ebitda. The one truly comparable transaction to Boulder is General Mills' acquisition of Annie's last year for about 36 times Ebitda.\n\nPlus, Boulder's relatively low Ebitda is projected to more than double next year, already making the transaction appear much cheaper. And those estimates were made before it links up with Pinnacle, a company that has deep ties with grocery chains and can probably scale up its brands.\n\nDeal activity in the industry has picked up as traditional food giants search for new, faster-growing brands. A $55 billion merger of Heinz and Kraft also took place this year.\n\nPinnacle's stock fell about 3 percent Tuesday morning, but it's exactly the kind of deal the company needs. When you look at its own offerings, you can see why. On the one hand, its products are found in 85 percent of U.S. households and are first or second in the market-share rankings for most of the major food categories in which they compete, Michael Halen, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote earlier this month. Even so, it's not like Wish Bone salad dressings, Mrs. Butterworth's pancake syrup and Mrs. Paul's fish sticks are on the verge of a big sales resurgence. Pinnacle's brands are stable and profitable, but not exactly big growth drivers.\n\nThe one risk here is that another bidder with deeper pockets jumps into the bidding. Though Boulder has been considered a takeover candidate for a while now, sometimes it takes a competitor making an offer to attract the attention of other would-be suitors. Now it's officially in play, and all of the major food companies are desperate for growth and looking for inroads into the natural, organic, gluten-free, every-possible-bad-ingredient-free space. And even though there are others with more impressive sales growth trajectories than Boulder, the need for dairy-free stuff will probably be around for a while.\n\nBoulder shares were trading just 7 cents below the $11-a-share offer on Tuesday morning, a minuscule spread for a transaction that just got announced. So some investors may be wondering about the possibility of competing bids. It would be a real blow to Pinnacle to have a deal stolen away from it again.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle in New York at tlachapelle@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.net",

I have asked that this analysis describe the options MIT had and the decisions MIT made, in order to understand and to learn from the actions MIT took. I will share the report with the MIT community when I receive it.\n\nI hope we will all reach out to those members of our community we know who may have been affected by Aaron\u2019s death. As always, MIT Medical is available to provide expert counseling, but there is no substitute for personal understanding and support.\n\nWith sorrow and deep sympathy,\n\nRelated: Spencer Ante has more details on Markets Hub.",

    "text": "Amanda Lucier / The Virginian-Pilot via AP file\n\nAs the first generation of kids who have \"helicopter parents\" graduates into the world, some some studies show that the parenting style may have backfired.\n\nBy JoNel Aleccia, Senior Writer, NBC News\n\nThe father who called to dispute the C grade his adult son got on a college exam had good intentions, Chris Segrin knows. He only wanted what was best for his kid, and if that involved lobbying the University of Arizona professor for a change, so be it.\n\n\u201cSomehow, his dad just seemed to know that the exam was worth a grade of a B,\u201d says Segrin, a behavioral scientist who studies interpersonal relationships and mental health.\n\nBut what the dad didn\u2019t know is that the phone call actually undermined his son, leaving the young man feeling insecure and incapable, not empowered and supported, a casualty of what researchers like Segrin describe as an epidemic of \u201coverparenting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it was all done, the son came in. He was actually a nice kid who apologized profusely,\u201d Segrin recalls. \u201cSometimes this type of parenting is imposed on children against their will.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s called overparenting or the better-known \u201chelicopter parenting,\u201d the style of overly attentive, competitive child-rearing popular since about the mid-1990s may have backfired.\n\nAs the first generation of overparented kids continues to graduate into the world, a slew of studies, including Segrin\u2019s, now show that youngsters whose parents intervene inappropriately -- offering advice, removing obstacles and solving problems that kids should tackle themselves -- actually wind up as anxious, narcissistic young adults who have trouble coping with the demands of life.\n\n\u201cThe paradox of this form of parenting is that, despite seemingly good intentions, the preliminary evidence indicates that it is not associated with adaptive outcomes for young adults and may indeed be linked with traits that could hinder the child\u2019s success,\u201d concludes Segrin\u2019s latest study, set to be published next month in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology.\n\nOther recent studies also have found that too much help can create undesired outcomes, including a paper by California sociologist Laura T. Hamilton that says that the more money parents spend on their child\u2019s college education, the worse grades the kid gets. Another study by Virginia psychologist Holly H. Schiffrin finds that the more parents are involved in schoolwork and selection of college majors, the less satisfied their kids feel with their college lives.\n\nCourtesy Studio One to One\n\nC. Lee and Khris Reed write the blog \"Helicopter Mom and Just Plane Dad,\" in which they chronicle their attentive efforts to parent 16-year-old Hailey. They defend their \"extremely overprotective\" style of parenting and disagree with studies that show that so-called helicopter parenting hampers young adults' coping skills.\n\nThat news doesn\u2019t sit well with parents like C. Lee and Khris Reed of Seffner, Fla., who are the producers of a blog dubbed \u201cHelicopter Mom and Just Plane Dad: Tales from the Not-So-Darkside of Parenting.\u201d In it, they proudly chronicle their all-too attentive parenting of their only child, 16-year-old Hailey, dubbed \u201cBeloved\u201d on the blog, and they don\u2019t apologize for it.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely overprotective and overbearing,\u201d says mom C. Lee Reed, 42, an executive assistant at a large orthopedic practice. \u201cI know at every second where she is and who she\u2019s with. I will monitor every bit of technology. She knows the rule is we know every password.\u201d\n\nThe Reeds are familiar with research on helicopter parenting and, in short, they don\u2019t buy it. Good parents naturally are invested in every aspect of their children\u2019s lives, they contend.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree that just because we\u2019ve been that way, we hamper her,\u201d says C. Lee.\n\nAdds Khris Reed, 41, a general manager for a local auto parts store: \u201cWhen people say \u2018helicopter parent\u2019 or \u2018helicopter mom,\u2019 in general, it\u2019s the idea of the mom standing in the bushes with binoculars. The far extreme has put a bad rap on it.\u201d\n\nThey believe that Hailey, who attends an online high school and doesn\u2019t drive yet, is developing the life skills and self-sufficiency she\u2019ll need to flourish at college in a few years, and later on her own, while still maintaining close ties with Mom and Dad.\n\nFor her part, Hailey thinks so, too.\n\n\u201cThey teach me a lot of things that I\u2019ll need to know in the real world so that I\u2019m not lost and I know how to take care of myself,\u201d she says.\n\nHelicopter parenting sprang up in the era of \u201cBaby on Board\u201d signs, mandatory car seats and bicycle helmets and police department fingerprinting sessions to prevent child abduction. There was a greater sense of anxiety, combined with a greater sense of competition, as the children of the massive Baby Boom generation reached high-school and college age, says Margaret Nelson, author of the 2010 book \u201cParenting Out of Control: Anxious Parents in Uncertain Times.\u201d\n\n\u201cParents have become constantly more involved in their children\u2019s lives than they were a decade or two ago,\u201d says Nelson, a professor of sociology at Middlebury College, a top liberal arts college in Vermont.\n\nThere was a push, especially among educated working professionals, to provide youngsters with every opportunity to succeed, from homework tutors and lacrosse camps at age 8 to college application essay assistance at age 18, the experts say. Parents became fierce advocates for their children, intervening with teachers, coaches -- even employers.\n\nThe problem with all that help, says Segrin, is that when it\u2019s overdone, it keeps children from developing their own age-appropriate strengths and skills.\n\n\u201cWhen we do not give the child the freedom to try on his or her own and maybe fail on his own, he doesn\u2019t develop the competency that children who fail learn,\u201d he says.\n\nSegrin\u2019s latest papers relied on interviews with more than 1,000 college-age students and their parents from across the nation. They found that many of the young adult kids are in touch with their parents constantly, with nearly a quarter communicating by text, phone or other means several times every day and another 22 percent reaching out once a day.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this endless contact with parents,\u201d says Segrin, who doesn't have children. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just calling to socialize. A lot of it is, \u2018How do I?\u2019 \u2018Will you?\u2019 \u2018Can you?\u2019 They are still quite reliant on their parents.\u201d\n\nThe studies showed that parents who felt more anxiety about their children and more regret about their own missed goals led to greater overparenting. At the same time, they found that kids who were overparented were more likely be anxious and narcissistic and to lack coping skills.\n\nThat makes sense to Elizabeth May, 22, a recent University of Arizona graduate who participated in Segrin\u2019s research with her mom, Suzanne May, 55. She says her parents were not the helicopter type, but she knows of plenty who were.\n\nIn one instance, the house where May lived with roommates was broken into and things were stolen. May called the landlord to ask that an alarm system be installed, but before she could finish the negotiations, her roommate\u2019s mother rushed in and demanded action.\n\n\u201cI felt like it kind of undermined my communication with our landlord,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like we could have gotten it done ourselves.\u201d\n\nSeparating harmful overparenting from appropriate parenting isn\u2019t easy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sure 100-percent fault-free parenting guidebook,\u201d observes Suzanne May.\n\nIn this culture, helicopter parenting is almost contagious, observes Nelson, the Middlebury College professor, with parents vying with each other to prove how engaged and attentive they are.\n\nIt would be better, suggests Segrin, for parents to put that energy into helping children -- especially late adolescents and young adults -- learn to handle problems and setbacks on their own\n\nThat can be challenging because different kids can handle responsibility at different ages, experts say. But it starts with parents actively choosing to let children experience the consequences of their actions instead of rushing to intervene. Suzanne May, an elementary school teacher who left the workforce while she raised her three kids, recalls a time when one child forgot crucial homework and called to ask May to bring it to school.\n\n\"I told her, 'No, it's your responsibility. I'm not at your disposal to say, 'Hey, Mom, I forgot this,'\" May says. That was a hard stance at the time, but her daughter learned that she needed to remember her work.\n\nIn the short run, letting kids suffer discomfort or failure is tough, Segrin says. Most parents want to help their children if they can.\n\n\u201cOverparenting is motivated with the idea of doing good things,\u201d Segrin says. \u201cBut it does the exact opposite in the long run. In the long run, parents are impairing their child\u2019s coping skills. They\u2019re winning the battle, but actually losing the war.\u201d",

    "text": "Those could have been the operating instructions for the first season of \u201cVikings,\u201d the straightforwardly entertaining History channel drama about rugged Norsemen (and Norsewomen) and the quaking Englishmen who fall like tenpins whenever battle is joined.\n\n\u201cVikings\u201d starts its third season on Thursday night, carrying a steady audience of more than three million, substantial for this tier of basic cable. It\u2019s a success that seemed unlikely when it began life in 2013 as History\u2019s first scripted series, looking like a cut-rate \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d knockoff.\n\nA Canadian-Irish coproduction filmed in Ireland, \u201cVikings\u201d had sweeping vistas to rival those of HBO\u2019s \u201cThrones,\u201d but neither the fantasy-tale license nor the special-effects budget to fill them with armies and architectural wonders. Tied in some nominal sense to the actual history of medieval Denmark, as handed down in the Viking sagas, it put realistically small bands of men in those big landscapes \u2014 20 Vikings on this side, 30 Northumbrians over there \u2014 and let them hack away at each other with a grunting, sweaty abandon.\n\nThat modesty turned out to be an all-around virtue. Without the surface sheen and labyrinthine plot of so many of its costume-drama counterparts, \u201cVikings\u201d was admirably focused and engaging, its story easy to follow and its requisite elements of family soap opera and philosophizing relatively restrained. The story featured Ragnar (Travis Fimmel) and Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick), farmers on their way to becoming a Norse power couple, and their struggles against Haraldson (Gabriel Byrne), the local nobleman who ruled over them and determined when and where the Vikings went on their pillaging expeditions.\n\nAs Season 3 begins, Haraldson is long gone \u2014 Mr. Byrne\u2019s no-nonsense performance is missed \u2014 and Ragnar and the fierce Lagertha are at least temporarily split, her place in his household taken by the willowy Princess Aslaug (Alyssa Sutherland, whose supermodel looks and stature seem to belong in another, glossier show, perhaps on Starz). Ragnar is now a king and in an uneasy alliance with the Saxon leader, Ecbert (Linus Roache), who has promised to give the Vikings farmland of their own in England \u2014 if they engage in a little mercenary slaughter of his rivals.\n\nThere\u2019s a feeling in the new episodes that the show is entering its decadent phase. The Vikings, having discovered England and had their way with it (up to a point), are looking jaded and world-weary, and the always enterprising Ragnar is a little too glum. Perhaps he\u2019ll perk up when he leads his merry band against Paris later in the season.\n\n\u201cVikings\u201d has benefited all along from the accomplished, subdued performances of a number of its cast, including Mr. Byrne, Mr. Roache, Clive Standen as Ragnar\u2019s warlike brother and both Nathan O\u2019Toole and Alexander Ludwig, who play Ragnar\u2019s son Bjorn at different ages. But the heart of the show remains Mr. Fimmel\u2019s smirking, withdrawn, not quite good but certainly distinctive performance as Ragnar, who\u2019s written by the show\u2019s creator, Michael Hirst, as a kind of eighth-century entrepreneur and visionary. He\u2019s the Vikings\u2019 risk-taking, slightly crackpot but also prudently strategic Steve Jobs, and as long as he\u2019s in charge their stock should keep rising.",

    "text": "IF you think that protests about overzealous law enforcement are over the top, listen to what unfolded when the police suspected that David Eckert, 54, was hiding drugs in his rectum.\n\nEckert is a shy junk dealer struggling to get by in Hidalgo County, N.M. He lives a working-class life, drives a 16-year-old pickup and was convicted in 2008 of methamphetamine possession.\n\nPolice officers, suspecting he might still be involved in drugs, asked him to step out of his pickup early last year after stopping him for a supposed traffic violation. No drugs or weapons were found on Eckert or in his truck, but a police dog showed interest in the vehicle and an officer wrote that Eckert\u2019s posture was \u201cerect and he kept his legs together.\u201d\n\nThat led the police to speculate that he might be hiding drugs internally, so they took him in handcuffs to a nearby hospital emergency room and asked the doctor, Adam Ash, to conduct a forcible search of his rectum. Dr. Ash refused, saying it would be unethical.\n\n\u201cI was pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do,\u201d Dr. Ash told me. \u201cIt was not medically indicated.\u201d\n\nEckert, protesting all the while, says he asked to make a phone call but was told that he had no right to do so because he hadn\u2019t actually been arrested. The police then drove Eckert 50 miles to the emergency room of the Gila Regional Medical Center, where doctors took X-rays of Eckert\u2019s abdomen and performed a rectal examination. No drugs were found, so doctors performed a second rectal exam, again unavailing.\n\nDoctors then gave Eckert an enema and forced him to have a bowel movement in the presence of a nurse and policeman, according to a lawsuit that Eckert filed. When no narcotics were found, a second enema was administered. Then a third.\n\nThe police left the privacy curtain open, so that Eckert\u2019s searches were public, the lawsuit says.\n\nAfter hours of fruitless searches, police and doctors arranged another X-ray and finally anesthetized Eckert and performed a colonoscopy.\n\n\u201cNothing was found inside of Mr. Eckert,\u201d the police report notes. So after he woke up, he was released \u2014 after 13 hours, two rectal exams, three enemas, two X-rays and a colonoscopy.\n\nThe hospital ended up billing Eckert $6,000.\n\nWhen I came across this case, it seemed far-fetched to me \u2014 more like rape than law enforcement. But the authorities, hospital and doctors all refused to comment, and, a few days ago, the city and county settled the lawsuit by paying Eckert $1.6 million.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a unique case. A few months earlier, a man named Timothy Young who lives nearby says that police officers pulled him over, forcibly strip-searched him in a parking lot and then took him to a hospital for a forced X-ray and rectal examination while he was handcuffed. Nothing was found, so he was released \u2014 only to receive a hospital bill.\n\nAnd a few weeks before Eckert\u2019s ordeal, a 54-year-old American woman crossing from Mexico into El Paso was strip-searched and taken to the University Medical Center of El Paso. She says in a lawsuit that, over six hours, she was shackled to an examination table and subjected to rectal and vaginal examinations \u2014 with the door open to compound her humiliation. After a final X-ray and CT scan, all of which turned up nothing, she was released \u2014 and billed for the procedures.\n\nJoseph P. Kennedy, Eckert\u2019s lawyer, notes that such abuses are not random but are disproportionately directed at those on the bottom rungs of society. \u201cIt\u2019s a socioeconomic issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the indignities forced on people who are not articulate, not educated and don\u2019t have access to legal services.\u201d\n\nPolice are caught in a difficult balancing act, and obviously the abuse of Eckert isn\u2019t representative. But it is emblematic of something much larger in America, a kind of inequality that isn\u2019t economic and that we don\u2019t much talk about.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of inequality that lies behind police stops for \u201cdriving while black,\u201d or unequal implementation of stop-and-frisk policies, or \u201czero tolerance\u201d school discipline codes that lead many low-income children to be suspended.\n\nThis inequality has a racial element to it, but it is also about social class (Eckert is white but struggling financially). This is about Americans living in different worlds. If you\u2019re a middle-class reader, you probably see the justice system as protective. If you\u2019re a young man of color, you may see it as threatening.\n\nSo as we discuss inequality in America, let\u2019s remember that the divide is measured in more than dollars. It\u2019s also about something as fundamental as our dignity, our humanity and our access to justice; it\u2019s about the right of working stiffs not to endure forced colonoscopies.",

They also said surgery to remove the mass was out of the question.\n\n\"One doctor said it's not ethical to cut into your head for no reason. I said there is a reason \u2014 there are symptoms. It's completely taken away any quality of life. He can't function anymore,\" Jones said.\n\n\"I asked the neurologist in Vancouver, if this is not causing the problem then what is? He said, 'I have no idea.' He said, 'You've tried everything \u2014 at this point I don't know what to tell you.'\"\n\nThe couple learned there is a surgical option available in the U.S. that has helped others with pineal gland cysts.

People are trying to donate, family and friends. It's a huge expense ... but when it comes to quality of life, you can't put money ahead of it,\" she says.\n\nGo Public has found more than a dozen Canadians who were diagnosed with a cyst on their pineal gland and went to the U.S. for surgery.

In that way, I do think Canada and the provinces could do well by [having] more neurosurgeons,\" he said.\n\n\"That doesn't mean that more neurosurgeons will take out lesions that they shouldn't, but patients can sit down face to face with someone who's trained to know not only how to take out a lesion in the brain, but when to take it out,\" he says.\n\nA cyst on the pineal gland can be complex and often requires consultation between neurosurgeons.\n\nToyota says he can't comment on specific cases or on why some Canadians are forced to go the U.S. and pay a lot of money for surgery, but says the issue is not a failure to correctly diagnose the problem.\n\nHe predicts as many as 700,000 Canadians have pineal gland cysts and don't even know it because they have no symptoms. Surgeons here do operate on this type of cyst, but only when it can be proven they are causing severe problems, and he says that is rare.\n\nDr. Hrayr Shahinian will perform Kettering's surgery on Nov. 17 in Los Angeles. He says he's operated on dozens of Canadians since he began offering the surgery in 2007.\n\nHe agrees with Canadian doctors that cysts rarely cause problems, but says when they get to certain size \u2014 the physical implications are serious.\n\nDr. Hrayr Shahinian, a skull base surgeon in Los Angeles, says he has treated more than 50 Canadians.

    "text": "In the US, Apple's best performing market, the 5S accounted for 67% of sales in Photograph: Adrees Latif /Reuters\n\nWhen Apple launched its latest iPhones in September, it tried a new tactic: cheap \u2013 well, cheaper, anyway. Later today, the company is to update investors, many of whom are worried the tactic may not have worked. The initial signs are not good.\n\nApple once ruled the smartphone market but now faces stiff competition from Samsung, HTC and others running Google's Android operating system. In September it launched a high end 5S iPhone aimed at its core customers and a cheaper, plastic-backed 5C that many supposed was meant to lure in new, more price-sensitive, consumers.\n\nJust a month later, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple suppliers had been asked to cut production of the 5C. Localytics, a marketing platform for mobile apps, calculates that the 5S has comfortably outsold the 5C in every single market since launch. Online, Apple says there is a three week wait for the 5S, but the 5C ships in 24 hours.\n\nSales of iPhones matter massively for Apple. Barclays Research estimates that the iPhone accounted for 53% of Apple's revenue for the fiscal year that ended September 30, compared with 19% for the iPad. Signs of a slip could send Apple's shares spiraling. \"They are extraordinarily dependent on that product,\" said Gartner's Carolina Milanesi.\n\nBefore the new iPhones launched, International Data Corporation said Apple posted a year-over-year decline in global market share during the second quarter of 2013. Android and Microsoft's Windows phone managed slight increases.\n\nAs yet, the 5C doesn't seem to be winning back sales. In the US, its best performing market, the 5S accounted for 67% of sales in the first month compared to the 5C. Localytics has found some evidence that the 5C is now gaining sales in the US over the 5S. In the rest of the world, however, 5S sales remain strongest. In the UK the 5S took 71% of sales, in Germany 87% and, perhaps most worrying of all, in China the more expensive phone took 83% of sales relative to the 5C.\n\nApple's 5C with its colourful plastic back arrived after investors had pressured the company to offer a cheaper phone that might attract less wealthy buyers, particularly in China. The 5C is basically an iPhone 5 with a cheaper case \u2013 but it is still not cheap. At launch, the device retailed in the US for $549, but can be had for $99 with a two-year contract. In China an unsubsidized iPhone 5S costs about $866, while an iPhone 5C costs $735.\n\nIn a note to investors after the launch, Toni Sacconaghi, tech analyst at Bernstein, expressed his frustration. \"We worry that Apple's inability/unwillingness to come out with a low-priced offering for emerging markets nearly ensures that the company will continue to be an overall share loser in the smartphone market until it chooses to address the low end,\" he wrote. \"In essence, Apple continues to risk being relegated to a high-end niche player.\"\n\nYankee Group analyst Carl Howe said it was too early to write off the 5C. \"The truth is we don't know. They don't break out sales for different models, so it's a guessing game.\" But he said the 5C was likely to pick up sales after launch with more price-sensitive shoppers. \"The 5C buyer isn't the sort of buyer who stands in line. Once the 5S frenzy has died down, the 5C will be more popular,\" he predicted.\n\nMilanesi said Apple's market share was slipping but that it was too simplistic to look solely at how much of the pie Apple was taking. She pointed out that only Apple and Samsung were managing to make money from smartphones and that Apple was protecting that position by retaining its premium position.\n\nWith the company so dependent on the iPhone, Milanesi said it was unlikely to mess too much with its magic formula until it had another \"wow\" product to do the heavy lifting. In the meantime \"cheap\" is likely to remain a relative term at Apple. \"I always question this idea of market share. I don't think Apple wants consumers who just want the cheapest iPhone. They want the consumer who buys into the ecosystem, who will buy and iPad, apps. They don't want to be the phone for everybody.\"",

(Greg Elms/LPI)\n\nA city more than 3,000 years old, Beijing is known for its epic palaces and ancient temples, co-existing happily alongside neon billboards and ultra-modern skyscrapers. By night, the city's attractions are a mixture of ancient traditions and modern hedonism.\n\nLose yourself in the hutong alleysIn the evenings, Beijing\u2019s 800-year old maze of narrow streets comes to life. As you stroll along amid delicious smells emanating from food carts, you will see residents playing mah jong in the street, getting a haircut in late-night barbershops, having an impromptu jam session or even wandering down to the communal bathrooms in their pyjamas. The best hutong areas are around the Drum Tower and Houhai Lake.\n\nA night at the Beijing OperaImagine a soap opera, but one that may involve ghosts, cross-dressing nuns, clowns, kung fu fighting and acrobatics. An intensely visual experience, it allows you to guess a character\u2019s role and importance from the intricacy of their costume or the colour of their makeup. Bring some earplugs in case you cannot take the vocal rollercoaster for the entire three-plus-hours, and enjoy the spectacle at the venerable Chang An Grand Theatre.\n\nCatch an acrobatics showAcrobatics have been part of Chinese culture for more than 2,000 years, and the top venues to witness incredible feats of human dexterity include Tiandi Theatre (10 Dongzhimen Nandajie) and Chaoyang Theatre. Expect plate spinning, tumbling, daredevil trapeze acts and balancing acts of up to nine acrobats riding a single bicycle. If you watch child acrobats, you will find yourself catching your breath because you see the potential for acts going wrong, making the show all the more moving.\n\nWatch a kung fu showThe harsh discipline of kung fu has evolved in China over many centuries. And while the performances at the likes of the Red Theatre are undoubtedly a departure from tradition, that does not detract from their visual impact. The frenetic routine is a blur of bodies as the fighters mock spar, show off their weapons skills, dance and perform feats of endurance, such as breaking blocks of concrete on one another\u2019s stomachs.\n\nGo clubbingChocolate attracts well-heeled professionals with its outrageous rococo floor show, whereas Kai Club (Sanlitun Beijie) acts as a magnet for local students, with a mix of break beats, indie and house. The chic Area, with international DJs doing weekend sets, caters to the young and stylish, who also lie around on Ming dynasty beds at The World of Suzie Wong, part 1930s Shanghai opium den, part postmodern lounge. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Mix (Inside Worker's Stadium north gate) heaves with hip-hop clubbers.\n\nSate the evening munchiesFaced with night food cravings, make a pit stop at one of Beijing\u2019s celebrated chicken joints: Kuan Dian (135 Jiugulou Dajie) or Chi Bang (218 Dongsi Beidajie) for the smoky, fiery wings. You can also fill a tin plate with steaming unidentifiable goodies from a food cart in a hutong, or head to Wangfujing Snack Street, the stalls piled high with seafood, noodles, pitas with grilled lamb and scorpion skewers.\n\nAdmire the night cityscapeThe National Stadium, aka the Bird\u2019s Nest, is spectacular when lit up at night, particularly when you see it reflected in the moat to the east. The stadium and its neighbour the Water Cube \u2013 its curvy lines and LED-lit bubbles contrast with the Bird\u2019s Nest\u2019s rigidity \u2013 are best seen from above. Sip a cocktail at the Happiness Lounge, the elegant bar at the Pangu 7 Star Hotel, with the panoramic view of the Olympic giants before you.\n\nAttend a gigBeijing\u2019s music scene has been going strong since the 1980s, its genres ranging from death metal and rock to jazz and electronica. Intimate Jianghu (7 Dongmianhua Hutong) entices blues and folk music aficionados and encourages impromptu jamming sessions between visiting musicians. Fledgling metal acts pound your eardrums at 13 Club while tiny What bar (72 Beichang Jie) packs in the crowds with its mix of psychedelic, ska and rock.",

    "text": "At the L.B.J. Library in Austin, Tex. on Tuesday night, Attorney General Eric Holder forcefully renewed the Department of Justice\u2019s commitment to protecting the right to vote. Invoking President Johnson\u2019s remarks on signing the Voting Rights Act into law in 1965, Holder said that the right to vote \u201cis not only the cornerstone of our system of government \u2014 it is the lifeblood of our democracy.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the attorney general exposed the coordinated campaign underway to deny the right to vote to millions of Americans, and pledged to use all of the weapons in the Justice Department arsenal to stop it. But advocacy to protect the right to vote is not enough to ensure that every American has a say in the future. We need to build a cultural movement for lifelong civic engagement that reflects the nation\u2019s growing diversity, and it should be led by Latinos, African-Americans and young people. Contrary to national perceptions (thank you, Governor Perry), Texas is the ideal place to start this movement.\n\nFirst, a personal note. I grew up in Texas, and after working for several years in New York City as a civil rights lawyer and advocate, I moved back to Austin earlier this year. What prompted the move was my desire to be a part of the tremendous change underway in my home state \u2013 changes that are harbingers of national trends that are redefining what it means to be an American. Yet while a majority of the state\u2019s population now consists of Latinos and people of color \u2013 communities that tend to be more progressive, at least in the voting booth \u2013 the power structure continues to be dominated by white conservatives.\n\nTexas was an ideal forum for Holder\u2019s remarks for more reasons than one. The state has the second highest number of objections filed under the Voting Rights Act, surpassed only by Mississippi. And our far-right-dominated state legislature is a national leader in building new hurdles to keep Texans from the polls, most recently through one of the country\u2019s most rigid mandatory photo ID laws. Because of its long history of minority disenfranchisement, Texas remains one of the nine states that continue to require Justice Department pre-clearance for changes to its voting rules and regulations.\n\nTexas is also a central battleground for voting rights because of its explosive growth. We gained more than four million new residents in the 2010 census, with Latinos accounting for 65 percent of that growth and other ethnic minorities for another 24 percent, earning four new congressional districts in the process. What happens here matters nationally, both because of the sheer number of voters in the state and because we\u2019re at the leading edge of a massive demographic shift. The legal battle over how to draw the new districts has been brewing for months and it is likely to have implications far beyond the state\u2019s borders now that the Supreme Court has decided to hear the case.\n\nTo build an electorate that is representative of Texas as it really is, the Department of Justice and civil-rights organizations must redouble their efforts to educate voters about their rights, protect against voter-suppression tactics and ensure fair representation in the new districts created in response to the most recent census.\n\nBut equally critical to building a vibrant democracy in the state is the need to vastly expand the number of engaged citizens \u2014 and not just on Election Day. Organizing and civic engagement must go hand in hand with policy and legal work, just as they did during the civil rights movement. To build a truly representative democracy, we need a groundswell of engagement that can push back against the most determined suppression efforts.\n\nIt isn\u2019t enough to have lawyers working to protect the franchise or for activists to register more voters. In fact, while other states struggle to register more eligible voters \u2014 a challenge that Attorney General Holder correctly pointed out could be easily solved through automatic voter registration \u2014 the rate of voter registration in Texas is actually on par with national averages.\n\nThe problem is that too few registered voters show up on Election Day, and too few stay engaged the day after. Texas has the lowest voter-turnout rate in the nation \u2013 only 32 percent of eligible voters participated in the 2010 elections, and the participation rate among Latinos was only 24 percent. The Republicans who currently have a lock on state power, and who are themselves overwhelmingly white, want to keep it that way. There\u2019s no question that deceptive practices discourage people from going to the polls, and the dilution of minority voting rights through gerrymandering leads many to believe that their vote won\u2019t count.\n\nOther factors contribute to the dismal turnout rate in Texas, and need to be addressed as well. The logistical challenges of poor public transportation, too few polling places and the state\u2019s failure to comply with the Voting Rights Act\u2019s language requirements, also have a disproportionate impact on people of color and low-income voters. Voters are understandably disillusioned by the inability of elected officials \u2013 from both parties \u2013 to represent their views and develop solutions to the country\u2019s problems. President Obama\u2019s harsh deportation record and failure to gain traction for immigration reform, for example, may well discourage many Latinos from voting next year.\n\nMore must be done to educate new citizens about the importance of civic engagement, and to build and support a culture of lifelong engagement among all Texans. There is \u201cno force more powerful,\u201d as Attorney General Holder reminded us, \u201cthan efforts to expand the franchise.\u201d But to build a culture of civic engagement, it isn\u2019t enough for the attorney general and other government officials to proclaim the importance of voting.\n\nSo what would it take? Many well-intentioned voter-turnout programs have failed to make a difference because their models are flawed. Too many focus their efforts on Election Day only, parachuting organizers in from out of state, knocking on strangers\u2019 doors, leaving generic messages on answering machines and sending unsolicited mail.\n\nA series about the complexities of voters and voting.\n\nInstead, the people who are responsible for the state\u2019s massive growth \u2014 Latinos, African Americans and younger residents \u2014 must be empowered to build their own cultural movement. We need year-round, non-partisan civic-engagement programs run by trusted community-based networks and organizations that provide services, education and support to communities. These organizations would keep people involved after Election Day, when the hard work really begins. Engaged voters must work together to hold their elected leaders accountable to campaign promises, from local leaders to state and federal officials. Only by staying active and organized can voters influence the policy issues that affect their lives \u2014 whether those issues are quality schools, clogged highways or federal immigration reform.\n\nTo build a cultural movement, we also need cultural leaders and messengers who will speak out \u2013 performers, bloggers, professional athletes and movie stars. In Texas, we\u2019re fiercely proud of our culture in all its diverse forms \u2013 from tacos and chicken fried steak to Texas swing and Tejano music. Culture here has the ability to unite natural political opponents, transcend race and class and build new forms of community. Texans of different backgrounds and political stripes love to showcase our cultural hybrids and to regale outsiders with obscure facts about Texas history and traditions. Just ask me about the accordion.\n\nWe need to engage the state\u2019s creative leaders in organizing and to get more creative with our organizing tactics. Why not build the base through blues and barbeque, host a traveling film series on social movements or plan a taco tour to transform Texas? Instead of being a national symbol for voter suppression and disenfranchisement, let\u2019s make Texas the center of a cultural movement for a vibrant democracy in which everyone has a voice.\n\nAnn Beeson is a former associate legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union and a former executive director of United States Programs at the Open Society Foundations, where she is currently a senior fellow.",

His 14 strikeouts after two games are the second-most by any Met, trailing only Matt Harvey's 18 in 2012.\n\nThe left-hander had a run-scoring groundout in a three-run fourth that made it 4-0, giving him five RBI in two games, tying him for the most by any Mets pitcher in a two-game span.\n\n''It's been a lot of fun. It's been great,'' Matz said. ''It's been a good learning experience so far, and I just want to keep learning and trying to get better. Today was a little bit different. I kind of know what it feels like now, so I just tried to relax and pitch.''\n\nMatz credited his fastball with being his best pitch.\n\n''The curve ball was so-so, but I was able to work with the fastball late in the count, especially up, and get some swings and misses on that,'' he said.\n\nLogan Verrett earned the first save of his career with three scoreless innings to end the game.\n\nMike Bolsinger (4-3) gave up four runs and a season-high nine hits in five innings, his fifth consecutive outing of less than six innings. The right-hander struck out four and walked two while throwing a career-high 101 pitches. After winning his first four starts at home, he's lost two in a row at Dodger Stadium.\n\n''A little unlucky,'' Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said of Bolsinger. ''He hung in there. I didn't think it was that bad. He wasn't getting squared up all over the yard. He kind of limited the damage.''\n\nNew York had 15 hits \u2014 one off its season high \u2014 against the Dodgers' struggling pitching in their worst shutout loss of the season that also equaled their largest margin of defeat.\n\nThe Mets' eight runs were their most since June 14, when they had 10, and they earned their first shutout against the Dodgers since June 30, 2012.\n\nFlores had a career-high four hits while driving in three runs and finished the three-game series 10 for 13. His single to Kike Hernandez in the fourth resulted in the Dodgers shortstop rolling over on his head with his legs splayed in the air in a fruitless attempt to field the ball.\n\n''Some of the guys are starting to break out,'' Mets manager Terry Collins said. ''Wilmer's really starting to swing the bat right now. He's hitting the ball to right field and he's not trying to pull things. When they're pitching him away, he's taking them the other way, and that's what good hitters have to do.''\n\n*By clicking \"SUBSCRIBE\", you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nJuan Lagares had a two-run triple and Ruben Tejada added an RBI single off reliever Juan Nicasio in the seventh when the Mets led 7-0.

She said they don't expect to speak to their client until at least next Tuesday.\n\nA voicemail message for Viviana Gunn's attorney, Jeniece Lacross, was not returned late Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the probable cause certificate filed Monday by the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office, the boy was sent to the Gunns' garage where he was duct-taped to a chair with tape over his eyes and mouth, then beaten in the head, torso and legs with a baseball bat and metal bars, losing consciousness at times.\n\nAnother time, the couple put the boy's hand in a bench vise, tightened it, and drove a nail through the his hand with a hammer, the certificate says. The boy said that time, he could see them doing it.\n\nThe Gunns duct-taped his hands and hung him from a rafter in the garage, then beat him; they also stapled his right palm with a construction stapler, heated a knife and cut him with it, according to the certificate.\n\nThe couple forced the boy to stay naked in a portable dog kennel twice for two to three days at a time, with no food or water, the certificate says. He also was forced to stay in the dark cellar for four days, and when he escaped to get food, he was punished by being beaten with a baseball bat, it says.\n\nThe boy said the couple called the abuse \"punishment sessions\" for not doing chores or breaking household rules, and that the \"sessions\" would last for two to three hours, according to Deputy Sheriff Wilson.\n\nWhen the boy escaped, he had been duct-taped but managed to escape by moving his hands in front of him, peeling the tape off his mouth, then chewing through the tape binding his hands, Wilson said. He forced open the cellar door and then lived on the streets for two weeks, stealing food when he could, Wilson said.\n\nHe was sleeping in a bus shelter on a Navy housing complex last Friday night when two Navy security officers found the boy and saw his injuries, Wilson said. They immediately sent the boy to a hospital where detectives interviewed him.\n\nThey saw injuries to the boy's head, face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, legs, hands and feet, ranging from fresh open wounds to wounds that were in the process of healing, the certificate of probable cause says.\n\nThe doctor also found a broken piece of metal in the boy's hand, possibly from the nail.\n\n\"In the first six hours they were able to develop enough probable cause for the arrest of the brother and the brother's wife,\" Wilson said. \"they were arrested at 7 a.m. (Saturday) at their house.\"\n\nWhen detectives interviewed Brandon Gunn, he denied abusing the boy, saying only that he gave him a \"whooping\" with a belt on his backside a few times.\n\nDetectives searched the home and found blood stains on the wall, door, bench vise, baseball bat and chair, the certificate of probable cause says. They also found the dog kennel and staple gun, and a strong smell of urine in a corner of the cellar where the boy said he was forced to urinate, it says.\n\nThe boy is out of the hospital and living with a foster family, Wilson said.\n\nThe Gunns' next court appearance is scheduled for September 10 in Kitsap County District Court, said Lewis, the prosecutor.\n\nPeople held captive in Philadelphia",

    "text": "Jealous of your long-legged peers? Turns out they may not have won the gene pool after all.\n\nNew research published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention found a surprising correlation between height and cancer risk among postmenopausal women; the taller the woman, the greater her risk for the disease.\n\nThe researchers studied more than 20,900 women ages 50 to 79 who participated in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) study, an on-going analysis of post menopausal women and the factors that contribute to their health. They separated the women into five groups based on their height, starting with women shorter than 5 feet 1 inch, and matched them to data on their cancer rates.\n\n(MORE: Mapping Cancer: Largest Set of Tumor Genomes Could Lead to Better Anticancer Drugs)\n\nThey discovered that for every 10 centimeters of height, a woman\u2019s risk of developing a range of different cancers increased by 13%. When they looked at all the cancers together, they found that taller women had a 13% to 17% greater risk of developing melanoma, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and colon cancer. They also had a 23% to 29% greater risk of developing kidney, rectum, thyroid and blood cancers. All of the cancers showed a positive association with height; none of the taller women showed a lower risk of cancer compared to their shorter counterparts.\n\nWhile the connection seems odd, previous studies have exposed the same association; it\u2019s possible, for example, that on the most basic level, the greater number of cells and tissues that taller people possess simply increases the odds that some of those cells will develop abnormally and become malignant. Alternatively, some of the same processes that fuel the growth that contributes to height may also feed tumors.\n\n\u201cUltimately, cancer is a result of processes having to do with growth, so it makes sense that hormones or other growth factors that influence height may also influence cancer risk, said Geoffrey Kabat, a senior epidemiologist in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in a statement.\n\n(MORE: Another Case of Brain Cancer In Baseball. What\u2019s Going On?)\n\nSome of those common factors may be genetic, while others could be linked to environmental exposures or nutrition early in life. As the authors write:\n\nAdult height is determined both by genetics and by early life exposures, and environmental circumstances in\ufb02uence the attainment of one\u2019s genetic potential. The in\ufb02uence of environmental exposures on height is evidenced by the secular increase in the height of populations in many countries beginning in the 19th century, probably re\ufb02ecting improvements in hygiene and nutrition. Height should thus be thought of as a marker for one or more exposures that in\ufb02uence cancer risk rather than a risk factor itself.\n\nWomen raised in higher socioeconomic households, for example, tended to be taller than those raised in lower income settings, reflecting the fact that different nutritional exposures may have played a role in both their height and cancer risk. Height may simply be a marker for factors such as nutrition, and identifying them may yield new understanding of about how to prevent and treat tumors more effectively, \u201c[The association between height and cancer] raises some interesting biological questions, and investigators can come up with [new] explanations,\u201d says the study\u2019s senior author, Dr. Thomas Rohan, the chair and professor of epidemiology and population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\nIn the meantime, Rohan and his colleagues say the study doesn\u2019t imply that cancer is inevitable for every tall woman. The study found an association, not a cause-and-effect relationship. And it\u2019s unlikely that diseases as complex as cancer can be traced to just one developmental process such as growth.",

    "text": "Amazon.com launched a new offering on Thursday that is aimed squarely at fulfilling its mission of delivering goods to its shoppers faster than any of its rivals.\n\nMembers of the Amazon Prime program in Manhattan now have access to Prime Now, a benefit in which shoppers can get two-hour delivery of an order of \"daily essentials\" for free or pay $7.99 for one-hour delivery. Prime Now is available in selected areas of the borough, and the tech giant plans to bring it to other cities in 2015. Customers can use this option on orders placed between 6 a.m. and midnight.\n\nAmazon has been experimenting with same-day delivery in major urban areas for a while now, in most cases requiring that orders be placed by noon to ultimately be delivered before 9 p.m. This new variation allows for more flexibility on delivery time and turbo-charges the speed at which Amazon is promising to bring orders to customers.\n\nThe announcement also makes clear what Amazon is doing with its space on 34th Street in Manhattan, which some had speculated was to be its first brick-and-mortar store. The company says a portion of that building will be the delivery hub for Prime Now orders.\n\nThere is no shortage of companies jockeying with Amazon for same-day delivery supremacy: Google is reportedly prepared to plow $500 million into its Google Express offering. Start-ups such as Postmates, Instacart and Deliv are also gaining traction.\n\nAll of these business are fighting hard to be the dominant player in a service that is extraordinarily hard to do profitably. This, in part, is why dot-com era efforts such as Webvan and Kozmo collapsed. It may also explain why eBay appears to have scaled back its ambitions for its own same-day delivery effort, eBay Now. EBay once promised to offer its same-day option in five to 25 cities by the end of the year, but that expansion never happened. Instead, the company is now focused on building its eBay Local offering, a delivery and in-store pickup program for small businesses.\n\nBut profitability may not be a top concern for Amazon, a company that has proven again and again that it\u2019s willing to take a loss on something that it believes will enrich its overall shopping experience and cultivate customer loyalty. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)\n\nPrime Now seems to bank on the notion that there's consumer appetite for near-instant gratification on certain kinds of online purchases. But all of these same-day delivery rivals are in the early innings of a long ballgame, and it remains to be seen whether what customers are really after with same-day delivery is raw speed or convenience and flexibility.\n\nFor example, when Deliv chief executive Daphne Carmeli founded her same-day business, she says, she bought up a trove of URLs with the words \"1-hour\" or \"60-minute\" in them, thinking that speed was going to be critical. But as the service grew, she found most shoppers weren't using it that way: They were scheduling deliveries for later in the evening when they were home from work, or for the free hour they had between yoga class and a dinner date.\n\nStill, Amazon and Deliv are focused on delivering different kinds of goods. Deliv partners with malls, so many of its packages contain apparel, small electronics and home goods. Amazon, meanwhile, is aiming to bring you \"daily essentials,\" such as paper towels, batteries or diapers. Maybe speed is more important for a shopper who has just run out of shampoo than a shopper who just snapped up a cashmere sweater.\n\nAs same-day delivery expands to more markets, these companies will likely get more clarity on exactly what their value is to consumers.\n\nHave more to say about this topic? Join us today for our weekly live chat, Switchback. We'll kick things off at 11 a.m. Eastern. You can submit your questions now, right here.\n\nSarah Halzack is The Washington Post's national retail reporter. She has previously covered the local job market and the business of talent and hiring. She has also served as a Web producer for business and economic news.",

    "text": "Investors have been drawn to the credit markets by high interest rates and by the relative weakness in other investments. But if the yields in these markets are high, so are the potential risks. For one hallmark of this recession has been the financial squeeze that has gripped corporations and governments alike, the very organizations that are the borrowers in the credit markets.\n\nOne way to follow the changing fortunes is by watching credit ratings. Are a state's bonds rated AAA or AA? Are a company's bonds being upgraded or downgraded?\n\nDespite the volatility in the markets, and the quick shifts that are possible in financial status, however, rating changes tend to come somewhat slowly, usually long after the market itself has shifted its view.\n\nTypically, the big rating services, such as Moody's Investors Service Inc. and the Standard & Poor's Corporation, issue new ratings when offerings are coming to market, or during an annual review. Thus, if a company's financial status deteriorated rapidly, chances are that a rating change might not be issued for some months, until the service had a chance to perform a thorough review.\n\nWith the volatile markets and rapidly changing financial positions, there has been pressure on the services to provide more information faster. Duff & Phelps, a highly regarded Chicago concern that does bond analyses, was one of the first to offer preliminary assessments of potential changes, before any ratings were formally changed.\n\nMore recently, S.&P. has made some effort to satisfy this voracious appetite for timely information. Last November, it introduced a service called Creditwatch, in its weekly credit bulletin, to alert investors to potential changes in ratings of bonds and other fixed-income securities before they happened.\n\nMoody's, however, has not yet adopted any early warning system. ''We feel that, whatever the rating is, that is what it is until we change it,'' said Claire Cohen, a vice president and associate director of the municipal rating department at Moody's. She added that, if Moody's saw a serious, fundamental change in the economics of a company or municipality, it might conduct an immediate rating review.\n\nAt S.&P., it might be a merger, a regulatory change or some other generally unexpected development that prompts an addition to the Creditwatch list. Although the name Creditwatch may sound somewhat ominous, not all of the changes are negative. Some Creditwatch companies represent possible upgradings in credit quality.\n\n''The game on Wall Street was to guess what we'd do next,'' said Byron Klapper, director of special fixed-income research at S.&P. and publisher of its bulletin, Creditweek. ''Brokerage firms would keep lists of what might be upgraded and what might be downgraded, and they'd make recommendations based on their analysis,'' he added. ''We went public with this game ourselves.''\n\nCreditwatch, though more timely, is still not a guarantee of a ratings change. As Mr. Klapper puts it, ''Creditwatch is not designed to be a hit list; it is only there to signal potential implications.''\n\nAlthough many of the signals of potential changes have foreshadowed ratings changes, in some cases a thorough review has led to no ratings change at all. There has even been one instance in which a company was placed on the Creditwatch list for a potential downgrading, but was eventually upgraded instead.\n\nIn that case, Nabisco Brands Inc. appeared on the list last November, with ''potential negative implications,'' after it expanded its borrowing to acquire Life Savers Inc. But after a thorough review of the company, earlier this month, S.&P. upgraded Standard Brands' senior debt and Nabisco Brands' preferred stock to AA from AA, and reaffirmed the AA on Nabisco Inc.'s senior debt.\n\nAt Nabisco Brands, Harrison Bains, senior vice president for finance, said that, ''obviously, we would rather not have been on the list at all, but it did not make a difference in how our bonds traded; my feeling is that the markets perceived that basically we were an AA company, and now that, of course, has been confirmed.'' Moody's had already issued a similar judgment last summer.\n\nWhile some bond market participants describe Creditwatch as a marketing gimmick, others are more complimentary. ''This is more information, and it should aid the investor,'' said Richard Wilson, a vice president for corporate bond research at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith.\n\nMr. Wilson cautioned, however, that the ratings were not meant to be indicators of short-term changes in an organization's position that could guide daily or weekly trading. Rather, they are guides to long-term credit quality, he said.\n\n''Just because a company has a down year in earnings doesn't mean it can't recover,'' he added, noting that a change in a credit rating would reflect more on the company's ability to recover than on its temporary decline in earnings.",

    "text": "Updated FEB 01, 2014 12:15a ET\n\nNEW YORK -- Finally, somebody stopped Kevin Durant: His coach.\n\nNot that Durant cared. The only streak he cares about is still intact.\n\nDurant's 30-point run ended at 12 games when he scored 26 in just 30 minutes, but the Oklahoma City Thunder won their 10th in a row with a 120-95 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Friday night.\n\n\"That's the most important streak,\" Durant said.\n\nSerge Ibaka made all 12 shots and added 25 points and nine rebounds for the Thunder, who were so good that Durant sat the entire fourth quarter, the only way to slow him down right now.\n\nDurant came out for good with 1:15 left in the third. Coach Scott Brooks didn't bother asking the NBA's leading scorer if he wanted to keep playing to extend the streak, saying he knew what the answer would be.\n\n\"If he cared about the streak, he should've never missed the two shots. That's on him. Can't blame it on me,\" Brooks said.\n\nDurant finished 10 of 12 from the field, though his scoring average during his sensational January dropped from 36.6 to 35.9. He had been streaking toward Tracy McGrady, who had the last longer streak when he scored 30 in 14 in a row in 2003.\n\n\"The streak was good while it lasted, but that's the least of my concerns,\" Durant said. \"It's easy for me to try to force it to keep the streak alive, but we needed this win because they beat us last time.\"\n\nReggie Jackson and Thabo Sefolosha scored 14 for the Thunder, on their longest winning streak since a 12-game run early in the 2012-13 season. They dominated the final three quarters in their 112-95 victory at Miami and picked up right where they left off in this one before a sellout crowd of 17,732 that included former President Bill Clinton.\n\nThey call this a landslide in his field.\n\nOklahoma City shot 63.6 percent (49 of 77), highest in the league this season, and outrebounded Brooklyn 41-17. The Nets' rebound total was the lowest in NBA history.\n\nShaun Livingston scored 16 points while drawing the impossible assignment of defending Durant for the Nets, who dropped their final two games to finish 10-3 in January.\n\n\"I mean, man, he's shooting the ball, it's tough,\" Livingston said. \"It's one of those where you've got to tip your hat to him.\"\n\nOklahoma City closed the first quarter with the final 13 points, eight from Ibaka and the rest from Durant, for a 30-16 lead. An 11-0 spurt in the second -- with just two points from Durant and Ibaka -- extended it to 45-24, and one more surge late in the period put it away.\n\nThe Nets started the month by holding Durant to 24 points while rallying from 16 down in a 95-93 victory at Oklahoma City, but Brooklyn was never in this game.\n\n\"I said it before the game. Everybody is talking about Durant scoring 30 points, but it's the rest of the guys that are playing at a high level,\" Nets coach Jason Kidd said. \"If you look at Ibaka, he's 12 for 12. So again, it goes back to what I said before the game, it's just not all Durant. He has guys on his team that have stepped up and been playing at a high level.\"\n\nDurant had a jumper and 3-pointer around Jackson's three-point play to extend it to 28, and Durant made a turnaround jumper and another 3-pointer on consecutive possessions late in the half for a 61-30 cushion. Ibaka capped his perfect half with a follow dunk and Oklahoma City led 63-35 at the break.\n\nBut Durant got only three shots in the second half, making two on alley-oops, before taking a seat for good to get a little extra rest before returning to his hometown Saturday to face Washington.\n\nThe Nets played without versatile forward Andrei Kirilenko, who would've been one of their best hopes of defending Durant, because of strained right calf. Backup center Andray Blatche left in the second half with a bruised left hip.\n\nDeron Williams had 14 points off the bench for the Nets and rookie Mason Plumlee scored 13. Kevin Garnett missed all four shots and was scoreless with one rebound in 12 minutes.",

    "text": "Chinese students and their parents attend the International Education Expo in Beijing on May 8, 2008\n\nSTR / AFP / Getty Images\n\nIt happens every summer. In the weeks after the annual National College Entrance Examination, new high school graduates wait for the list. For years, who gets into China's most prestigious universities has been a matter of public interest, as Chinese reporters publish a roll call of the highest-scoring high school graduates from each province. And for years, that list of the nation's top 100 and 200 students has determined which one of the country's top universities \u0097 Peking or Tsinghua \u0097 lands most of them.\n\nNow, however, something has changed. Big-name foreign universities are complicating the two-way rivalry \u0097 a trend that has both China's education experts and the general public worrying about the competitiveness of higher education in China. While 9.3 million Chinese students took the college-entrance exam in 2011, close to 1 million high school graduates did not, and among them, some 200,000 chose to go to foreign universities instead. Today over 100,000 Chinese high school graduates attend college in the U.S. each fall, and this year at least 17 of the top 100 mainland students chose to go to the University of Hong Kong. (See pictures of the making of modern China.)\n\nThe exodus of the country's brightest high school students has renewed discussions in the media about the ongoing problem of higher-education reform. And so far \u0097 in the absence of any clear evidence that reform is actually happening \u0097 public opinion of China's universities has become more and more skeptical, if not downright negative.\n\nA recent disclosure of the total debt racked up by China's universities last year \u0097 a record $40.69 billion \u0097 has not helped their cause. Although experts largely attribute the debt to the expansion of campuses as a result of surging demands for higher education, the news quickly spread online, triggering more questions and calls for change. \"Without [higher education] reform, there will be no improving in the quality of education to begin with, because all universities are essentially the same institutions under the same guidelines,\" says Xiong Bingqi, vice president of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, a nongovernmental organization focused on China's education reform. \"We are seeing more students voting with their feet now, and the government is definitely feeling the pressure.\" (See pictures of the 90th anniversary of China's Communist Party.)\n\nBeijing knows something has to be done. In the official 10-year blueprint for education reform issued by the State Council last July, policies like \"expanding the universities' administrative authority\" were listed \u0097 albeit vaguely \u0097 among its 70 bullet points. If implemented, such policies would be the first step toward freeing universities from governmental control, a drastic turn from the status quo. \"The truth is, no one has come up with a plan toward realizing such goals yet,\" says Xiong. \"And without a concrete plan, local governments are certainly not incentivized to give their power up.\"\n\nSo far, attempts to change the system from within have not yielded much. Earlier this year, the South University of Science and Technology of China (SUSTC), a much anticipated experimental university that has prided itself on its groundbreaking principles of management, was ordered by the Ministry of Education that all students admitted must take the standardized national admittance exam, a requirement the SUSTC was trying to abolish. The school's leadership was further lambasted by three professors from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for putting reform for reform's sake before education and \"driving the university away from its original goal to becoming a top research-oriented university.\" (See \"Education in China vs. U.S.: Don't Sweat Global Test Data.\")\n\nEven if a education reform does win government backing, making those improvements would be confronted with a different obstacle: money. \"On the one hand, the schools need more administrative power in terms of admissions and recruiting,\" says Yu Lizhong, president of East China Normal University. \"On the other, to be able to hire a better teaching staff requires a lot more money than what the government is providing now.\" Yu, whose university is home to New York University's newly established Shanghai campus, speaks admiringly of a recent NYU fundraising event he participated in, adding that Chinese universities, predominantly funded by the government, have a lot of catching up to do.\n\nIn the long run, however, changing how the public values higher education might present the bigger challenge. For many, education is equated with survival in the government-devised system \u0097 a pragmatic means to an end: a stable job. \"Although there's a lack of confidence in the current education system, people still recognize an accredited diploma much more than the education itself,\" says Xiong. \"And that needs to be changed.\"\n\nSee TIME's special report on what makes a school great.\n\nSee TIME's Pictures of the Week.",

    "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Rem I. Vyakhirev, who as chief executive of the huge Russian energy company Gazprom during the 1990s resisted efforts by reformers to break up and privatize it, only to end his tenure a billionaire owning valuable pieces of the company himself, died on Monday. He was 78.\n\nHis death was confirmed by a Gazprom spokesman, who did not provide the cause or place of death.\n\nEarly in the post-Soviet period, Mr. Vyakhirev seized on the possibilities of exploiting the sheer power and scale of the Russian natural gas industry \u2014 both for the government and for private enrichment.\n\nHis career spanned the transformation of what had been the Soviet ministry of gas into the world\u2019s largest natural gas company. By the time he left Gazprom, in 2001, forced out in a din of criticism over missing assets, Forbes magazine estimated his net worth at $1.5 billion.\n\nAll along, though, Mr. Vyakhirev, reflecting a strange cognitive dissonance that characterized his career, espoused the benefits of state ownership of natural gas fields and pipelines. Gazprom, which is controlled by the Russian government but is 50 percent owned by private investors, remained whole while the Russian oil industry was split up and sold piecemeal. The company supplies about a quarter of all gas consumed in Europe today.\n\n\u201cThe gas industry should be in one pair of hands, in state hands,\u201d Mr. Vyakhirev said in September in an interview with the Russian edition of Forbes. \u201cThere\u2019s all this talk about gas being an addiction, how to get off the gas needle. That\u2019s ridiculous. Gas is a wet nurse, not a needle.\u201d\n\nRem Ivanovich Vyakhirev was born on Aug. 23, 1934, in a village in the Samara region of southern Russia. His given name is an acronym evoking socialist progress: Revolution, Engels and Marx.\n\nBy the late 1980s, he had risen to deputy minister of gas in the Soviet Union. He assumed control of Gazprom in 1992, when his patron, the former minister of gas, Viktor S. Chernomyrdon, was appointed prime minister under President Boris N. Yeltsin.\n\nMr. Vyakhirev and a tight group of associates held sway over Gazprom\u2019s assets, including whole towns in Siberia. The company became an island of the old Soviet system in the new Russia, known as the state within the state, a paternalistic monopoly with tens of thousands of coddled employees.\n\nThe company\u2019s staggering wealth and size made Mr. Vyakhirev one of Russia\u2019s most powerful men. He was able to shrug off efforts by the tax ministry to collect billions in arrears from the company in the mid-1990s. He also aided the state by informally ladling out funds from the corporate budget.\n\nYevgeny Yasin, the minister of economy at the time, recalled Mr. Vyakhirev\u2019s eagerness to help the government on such projects as rebuilding a cathedral in Moscow.\n\n\u201cHe always helped,\u201d Mr. Yasin said, as quoted by Public Post, a news Web site. \u201cGazprom was a second budget, in fact an \u2018extra pocket\u2019 for the government, to be used during especially difficult situations.\u201d\n\nAll the while, beginning with a quiet deal soon after the company\u2019s founding that allowed company executives to buy up to 30 percent of Gazprom shares at auctions they controlled, pieces of Gazprom slipped away to nonstate entities.\n\nPublic documents and financial records later showed that some assets went to Mr. Vyakhirev and members of his family, a sign of the rough and loose ways of early Russian capitalism. One deal, for example, transferred about $185 million worth of gas fields to Sibneftegaz, a subsidiary partly owned by Mr. Vyakhirev\u2019s relatives.\n\nAs pressure mounted to oust Mr. Vyakhirev, Boris Fyodorov, a former minister of finance, disclosed that tens of billions of dollars worth of gas sales from Russia to former Soviet countries like Ukraine went through Itera, a trading company based in Jacksonville, Fla., and partly owned by Gazprom managers.\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin, in consolidating political control over Russia early in his first term, ousted Mr. Vyakhirev in 2001 by having government appointees on the board cancel his contract. Mr. Vyakhirev stayed on as chairman for a year. The new director, Aleksey B. Miller, then set about unraveling the old management\u2019s insider deals.\n\nGazprom\u2019s stock rallied for a time before the global recession, but has been in a swoon for years. The company is losing market share in Europe because of price pressure from the gas industry in the United States.\n\nMr. Vyakhirev\u2019s survivors include a son, Yuri, and a daughter, Tatyana Vyakhireva.\n\nIn the Forbes interview last year, Mr. Vyakhirev said he had taken up hobby farming in retirement. \u201cI never wanted to be the head of a company,\u201d he said. \u201cBut why refuse if the entire business is in your hands? If you give it to somebody, they would either drink it away or lose it.\u201d",

They also agreed to change CVHS\u2019 Arab mascot to look less barbaric and more distinguished.\n\nThe changes followed 10 months of collaboration with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), a civil rights group based in Washington, D.C.\n\nADC had lobbied officials at Coachella Valley Unified School District since November 2013 to amend the school\u2019s team name and drop its mascot \u2014 a grimacing face that many Arab-Americans said promoted negative stereotypes.\n\n\"The mascot is basically an angry \u2018Arab\u2019 head \u2013 hooknose, long beard, headscarf and all,\" Abed Ayoub, ADC\u2019s legal and policy director, said in November when Al Jazeera broke news of the group\u2019s campaign.\n\nAt the time, Ayoub insisted that the school\u2019s representations of Arab culture \u2014 including its use of harem girls in marching band parades and a belly dancer half-time show \u2014 were classic examples of Orientalism, a term used to describe Western depictions of Middle Eastern, North African and Asian societies as backward and inferior.\n\nThe school\u2019s new mascot \u2013 described in a statement issued by ADC as \u201ca stoic, strong-jawed man with a neatly trimmed beard\u201d \u2013 was chosen with input from members of the Arab-American community.\n\nThe image was designed by Jesus Olivares and Sergio Espinoza, CVHS alumni and owners of INKA Screen Printing & Embroidery in nearby Indio, California.\n\nFrom the very beginning, ADC conceded that any offense was likely accidental, but said that steps still needed to be taken to remedy the situation.\n\n\u201cThe old logo and the old imagery was very stereotypical, it was very offensive to many in the [Arab-American] community, but at the same time, the school district and the high school and those involved did not mean to offend the community,\u201d ADC\u2019s Ayoub said. \u201cSo this was not done with malice and was not done with bad intent.\u201d\n\nDarryl Adams, the school district\u2019s superintendent, echoed Ayoub in saying educators need to \u201cforever keep our eyes, ears and hearts open to the feelings of others even when no disrespect or harm is intended.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe realization that the Coachella Valley High School mascot and name was offensive to fellow citizens or any group is one that we cannot ignore,\u201d Adams said. \u201cAs educators we are beacons of hope and light in helping students understand their place in society and that place does not include stereotypical images that offend.\u201d\n\nSchool officials and the ADC said Friday that phasing out the offensive imagery would take place over the coming months. The previous mascot\u2019s image has already been removed from CVHS\u2019 basketball court and it no longer makes appearances at football games. The school has also ceased its tradition of belly dancer half-time shows.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, school officials plan to redesign campus murals that stereotype Arab culture \u2014 including one in which a man and woman in tiny vests and harem pants sit atop a textbook-turned-magic-carpet. In the long term, the school is working toward offering Arabic language courses and even a cultural-exchange program with schools in the Middle East, Ayoub said.\n\nSchool officials estimate that the redesign will cost between $15,000 to $25,000 \u2014 all of which they plan to raise from private donations, not taxpayer money.\n\n\u201cThis process has been a learning experience for everyone involved,\u201d said ADC President Samer Khalaf. \u201c We have had an opportunity to teach those in Coachella Valley about Arab culture and heritage. At the same time, we have had the opportunity to learn about the history of Coachella Valley and its strong connection to the Arab world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe past 10 months have shown that almost any problem can be resolved through dialogue and cooperation,\u201d Khalaf added.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that similar matters, including that involving the Washington [Redskins] professional football team, can reach a resolution that respects the culture and history of specific communities.\u201d",

    "text": "WHEN China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, visited the north-western region of Xinjiang in late May he spoke of spreading nets \u201cfrom the earth to the sky\u201d to capture terrorists. The increased concern of China\u2019s leadership with domestic security coincides with an uptick in violence attributed to ethnic tension, and possible indications of growing links between Xinjiang and foreign Islamist extremists.\n\nIn the last eight months, since a flaming car ploughed into crowds in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, killing five, there has been an escalating number of attacks labeled as terrorist throughout the country. The government blames such actions on \u201creligious extremists\u201d from the Uighur community, a Xinjiang-based Muslim ethnic group. A key factor behind the upsurge in attacks, the government says, is the spread of extremist materials aligned with global jihad.\n\nMr Xi\u2019s \u201cnets\u201d remark coincided with the launch of a year-long anti-terrorism campaign. State media reports that during its first month authorities busted 32 gangs and sentenced 315 people to prison or death for crimes including religious extremism, manufacturing guns, spreading propaganda and illegally crossing international borders. One sentencing of 55 suspects in front of a crowd of 7,000 at a sports stadium in Yili prefecture evoked China\u2019s revolutionary era rallies. On June 29th a further 113 people with Uighur names were sentenced to prison terms in Kashgar, a city in western Xinjiang, for crimes including terrorism, inciting ethnic hatred, bigamy and drug trafficking.\n\nThe government has also renewed efforts to curb the spread of extremist material online. \u201c[Terrorist suspects] exchanged experiences of making explosives and propagating jihad through chat tools, text messages and illegal preaching sites,\u201d Xinhua, a state-run news agency, said. It added that Chinese police tracked over 100 pieces of terror-related audio and video content in 2013, compared with 32 in the previous year.\n\nOne concern is that some elements among Xinjiang\u2019s Uighur population, long having chafed at Communist Party rule, are becoming radicalised. On June 24th state television broadcast a documentary (in Chinese) designed to suggest as much. The film included gruesome footage from past terror attacks and also clips of jihadist videos alleged to be from Xinjiang militants from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). Details about ETIM, which seeks an independent state encompassing Xinjiang and other Middle Eastern countries, remain murky and contested. Stratfor, an American research outfit, says ETIM is the Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP) by another name. The TIP has lately expanded its online presence, issuing videos calling for a jihad by Uighurs, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, an American think tank.\n\nA report by the Wall Street Journal points out that the new wave of Uighur-language videos do closely resemble ones used by Middle Eastern jihadist networks. In one, men in balaclavas and camouflage garb train with swords in what is said to be the Gobi desert. In another scene militants burn Chinese and American flags. The amount of radical material on Uighur-language websites has increased as internet access in remote parts of the north-west has improved. The internet in Xinjiang, even more so than the rest of China, is heavily censored, driving Uighurs to use virtual private networks to access content from abroad.\n\nForeign analysts have long been sceptical about the links between Uighur separatists and the global jihadist independence movement. The unrest they say instead stems from resentment at Communist Party rule. There are around ten million ethnic Uighurs in China. Their language is Turkic and they practice Sufi Islam. Since the party wrested control of Xinjiang in 1949 there have been violent clashes. Some Uighurs protest what they say is cultural assimilation. In 1949, 76% of Xinjiang\u2019s population was Uighur and 7% ethnic-Han. In 2012 Uighurs made up 46% while the number of people of Han ethnicity amounted to 39%. Grand infrastructure schemes and booming trade is transforming the region. But many Uighurs\u2014especially those who do not speak Mandarin or who lack skills\u2014feel they miss out on benefits that instead flow to Han migrants.\n\nIn the wake of spiralling unrest Mr Xi has called for tighter restrictions on religion and for greater assimilation. Critics argue such policies only increase the alienation of Uighurs. The party seems determined to quell even moderately dissenting voices. Ilham Tohti (pictured, in 2010), a prominent Uighur scholar known for his critical but judicious views, was detained in January and charged with inciting separatism. On June 26th Mr Tohti\u2019s lawyer was able to see his client for the first time since his arrest at a prison in Urumqi, Xinjiang\u2019s capital.\n\nMr Tohti\u2019s state of mind was \u201cvery anxious\u201d and that he had been held in leg irons for 20 days and denied food for eight. If convicted of separatism Mr Tohti could face a lengthy prison sentence or the death penalty. His detention continues to draw condemnation from human rights groups worldwide\n\nThe recent spate of terror attacks suggests that the government\u2019s Xinjiang strategy is going badly awry. On May 22nd attackers drove two cars into a market in Urumqi, throwing explosives and killing 31 people. In April in a knife and bomb attack in the same city three people died. In March a group of Uighurs stabbed 29 people to death in Kunming, a city in the south-west. A recent review of China\u2019s security environment by Chinese academics said terrorism in the country has entered an \u201cactive period\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile analysts who watch online jihadist content in other languages report references to Turkestan from non-Uighur militants are becoming more frequent. This suggests that Xinjiang may indeed be increasingly on the radar of a broader global jihad. If the videos are any indication Mr Xi will have to cast his net wide.\n\n(Picture credit: Frederic J.

    "text": "The 2016 season is nearly (finally!) upon us and there is plenty to be sorted out. Heading into Week 1, there appears to be a handful of teams that are substantially better than the rest of the league, but things change in the NFL -- and they change quickly. Just ask the defending Super Bowl champs, who are starting Trevor Siemian in the opener. Here are your Week 1 power rankings (sorry, San Francisco). Photo: Joe Nicholson / USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Seahawks enter the season as the best team in football. Despite losing Marshawn Lynch to retirement, Seattle is loaded at running back and Russell Wilson is building on a stellar second half of 2015. The Seahawks play in the NFC West, where the Cardinals also reside, but the rest of their schedule is favorable. Photo: Full Length/Christian Petersen\n\nEven with Tom Brady on the field for only 12 games, the Patriots are the best team in the AFC. They\u2019ll feast on the AFC East and take care of business in the conference with the Steelers being the only threat to their chances at reaching the Super Bowl. Photo: Jeremy Brevard\n\nGreen Bay is a close second to the Seahawks in the NFC and should improve on a disappointing 2015 season now that Jordy Nelson is healthy. The Packers\u2019 secondary is loaded with talent and is on the verge of breaking out in a big way. They should take care of business in a Teddy Bridgewater-less NFC North. Photo: Michael Dixon / Sportsnaut / Yardbarker\n\nThe defending NFC champions are stronger on offense but noticeably weaker on the defensive side of the ball. That\u2019s because three-quarters of the secondary is gone, namely Josh Norman. The Panthers will put up points in bunches and wear down defenses with a relentless rushing attack, though. Photo: Jim Dedmon\n\nCarson Palmer gets a lot of credit in Arizona, and for the most part, he deserves it. But in order for the Cardinals to beat the Seahawks in the NFC West, they\u2019ll need Palmer to be outstanding \u2013 which he hasn\u2019t always been down the stretch. Fortunately, they play against the Rams and 49ers four times combined, which will equate to four wins.\n\nWhile Pittsburgh will be without Le\u2019Veon Bell for the first three games, it will merely be a small bump in the road. Cincinnati is their only real threat in the first three weeks, and upon Bell\u2019s return, the Steelers will return to form. They\u2019re a team to watch in the AFC.\n\nThe Bengals and Steelers: at it once again in the AFC North, as they typically are. The Bengals aren\u2019t far behind the Steelers, but they do lack firepower on offense due to the departures of Mohamed Sanu and Marvin Jones. The rushing attack will need to step up in a big way. Photo: Aaron Doster\n\nBack to defend their title, the Broncos lack identity on offense. Trevor Siemian is a huge question mark and the run game is far from dominant. The defense is exactly that, though. Denver will win games thanks to its defense, just as it did last season en route to a ring.\n\nHad it not been for Teddy Bridgewater\u2019s injury, the Vikings would have been slightly higher. Not much, however. Sam Bradford has the talent to lead Minnesota to a playoff berth so long as he fixes his sometimes-erratic accuracy and meshes well with Norv Turner\u2019s offense. He absolutely has the weapons around him, but the offense will go as he does. Photo: Jerry Holt / AP\n\nKansas City has a fairly rough schedule to start the year, and it only gets slightly easier down the stretch. That\u2019s because the Chiefs play in the AFC West where the Broncos and Raiders are also located. The Chiefs have a dynamic rushing attack and a stout defense, which will help them weather the storm until Justin Houston is able to return. Photo: Rob Carr\n\nThe Raiders are among the biggest risers in the NFL and are poised to make a serious playoff push. They\u2019ll have to overcome a daunting schedule in the AFC West, but they have the leadership, youth, as well as the overall talent to make it happen. Derek Carr should continue to improve. Photo: Charles LeClaire\n\nNo Tony Romo? Slight problem. Unlike in years past, the Cowboys have a viable backup in Dak Prescott. He, Ezekiel Elliott and Dez Bryant can combine to keep the offense going until Romo returns, which could be as soon as Week 7 or as late as Week 10. It\u2019s unclear as of now, but the Cowboys are certain he\u2019ll play this season. If he does, Dallas can take advantage of a mediocre division with no clear front-runner. Photo: Tim Heitman\n\nAn offseason filled with changes, smart drafting and free agent acquisitions, the Texans are no longer a team that got lucky a year ago. They\u2019re a serious threat in the AFC South and the Colts should be worried. Brock Osweiler, Lamar Miller and DeAndre Hopkins are going to carry the offense while J.J. Watt, Whitney Mercilus and Jadeveon Clowney will be outstanding up front. Photo: Troy Taormina\n\nSpeaking of the Colts, Indianapolis lacks weapons on offense and the defense is short of playmakers. Fortunately, they have Andrew Luck. He boasts the rare ability to carry a passing game, much like Aaron Rodgers did last season with a lackluster group of receivers. Luck has to remain healthy, and if he\u2019s able to stay out of harm\u2019s way, the Colts are in good shape to contend for a playoff berth. Photo: Darron Cummings / AP\n\nThe Giants completely retooled their defense, adding Olivier Vernon, Damon Harrison, Janoris Jenkins and Eli Apple, among others. There are still questions about the secondary even after the addition of Jenkins, which doesn\u2019t bode well for them in the pass-heavy NFC East. At least there is no runaway favorite in the division, which means they can easily come out on top. Photo: Mel Evans / AP\n\nThe Redskins didn\u2019t do much to win the division last season, but at least they had a run game. Washington now boasts arguably the worst backfield in football and it\u2019s going to have a significant impact on Kirk Cousins and the offense. The Redskins aren\u2019t far behind Dallas or New York, but they have far more holes to fill on both sides of the ball. Photo: Nick Wass / AP\n\nJameis Winston has the Buccaneers trending in the right direction despite the fact that the roster is relatively young. Doug Martin is coming off of a career year while Mike Evans and Vincent Jackson are two towering targets for Winston. If rookies Vernon Hargreaves and Noah Spence can play well early on, the defense will be in good shape. That\u2019s a big \u201cif,\u201d though.\n\nThe Jaguars, like the Raiders, have improved dramatically of late. They have a bevy of young talent on defense, led by Jalen Ramsey, Myles Jack and Dante Fowler. Yet, the offense is the more stable unit. Blake Bortles and the \u201cAllen Bros.\u201d \u2013 Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns \u2013 are as explosive of a trio as any in the NFL. They just need more experience as a whole. Photo: Jesse Reed / Sportsnaut / Yardbarker\n\nBaltimore was forced to deal with injury after injury last season, but they\u2019re healthy for the most part in 2016 \u2013 at least the core is. Joe Flacco will have to work his magic and carry the offense that has depth at running back but lacks elite wide receiver talent. It\u2019s going to be an up-and-down season.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick is back after winning 10 games with the Jets a year ago, but he\u2019s going to have a very difficult time replicating his 2015 campaign. As a result, the Jets are going to take a step back and regress a bit. The defense is aging and Fitzpatrick is just mediocre, which will make for a lackluster season in the AFC East.\n\nFor a team that has Matt Ryan, Devonta Freeman and Julio Jones, you\u2019d expect the Falcons to be much better than they are. They struggle because the defense lacks even a decent pass rush and there are questions at just about every spot. If Ryan can cut down on the turnovers, perhaps they\u2019ll finish above .500. I just don\u2019t see that happening, though.\n\nAfter declaring that the Bills had won the offseason, Rex Ryan has seen his team deteriorate by the day. Karlos Williams was cut, their two best rookies are injured and LeSean McCoy has gotten himself in some hot water this offseason. Not to mention, Sammy Watkins is Buffalo\u2019s only reliable target. Outside of him at wide receiver, there\u2019s nothing to get excited about. It\u2019s playoffs or bust for Ryan and the Bills. Photo: Brett Carlsen\n\nDrew Brees continues to put up astronomical numbers at quarterback despite reports suggesting his arm isn\u2019t what it once was. Regardless of that rumor, Brees is still a top-10 quarterback. Unfortunately, the Saints are thin at several positions, particularly cornerback and wide receiver. Brees will need a career year to get them over the hump and earn the Saints a winning record. Photo: Kevin C. Cox\n\nThe Eagles traded Sam Bradford to the Vikings, so how many wins will that cost Philadelphia? Not many, if any at all. Carson Wentz will certainly have his share of rookie struggles early on, especially after playing just a handful of preseason snaps in his career. Expect him to get off to a rough start before righting the ship and inching Philly towards .500, only to come up short. It\u2019ll be a rebuilding year for the Eagles. Photo: Eric Hartline\n\nThe Dolphins have talent at key spots \u2013 Ryan Tannehill, Jarvis Landry, DeVante Parker, Arian Foster \u2013 and have looked great in the preseason on offense, but the defense is filled with no-name players. The cornerback position is an absolute mess and the linebackers aren\u2019t any better, despite having the oft-injured Kiko Alonso. The defense is just not good enough to stop anyone through the air.\n\nYear 1 without Calvin Johnson should be telling of Matthew Stafford\u2019s ability to elevate the offense, but it\u2019s going to be a struggle to say the least. And with no true three-down back behind him, he won\u2019t get much help from the running game. The Lions need to find a rushing attack if they want to win even six games. Photo: Dave Reginek\n\nMatt Forte\u2019s departure is far from Chicago\u2019s biggest issue. The offensive line is porous and the defense doesn\u2019t have a true No. 1 cornerback, let alone any worthy starters that are healthy at the moment. And with the Packers and Vikings in the same division, Chicago is going to have a hard time winning games. Jay Cutler will be airing it out early and often, which isn\u2019t a good thing.\n\nMarcus Mariota got a much-needed boost on offense with the additions of DeMarco Murray, Derrick Henry, Jack Conklin and Andre Johnson. Unfortunately, they won\u2019t be enough to make up for a defense that has one of the worst secondaries in football. It\u2019s a passing league, and the Titans won\u2019t be able to limit any opponent through the air. Photo: Wesley Hitt\n\nPhilip Rivers has a good shot at throwing for more than 4,500 yards. The Chargers also have a good chance of winning fewer than five games. As a whole, San Diego looks like it\u2019s in for a rough 2016 season. The schedule isn\u2019t favorable and the AFC West is stacked, which doesn\u2019t bode well for a team that didn\u2019t improve a whole lot in the offseason.\n\nNo. 1 overall pick Jared Goff can\u2019t currently beat out Sean Mannion for the backup quarterback job, let alone crack the starting lineup. The Rams\u2019 best assets are Todd Gurley and the defense, but even they won\u2019t be strong enough to overcome Los Angeles\u2019 deficiencies at quarterback and receiver. Photo: Kirby Lee\n\nDon\u2019t act surprised. The Browns are bad once again, even with RG3 under center. The defense is so unspectacular that the Browns were happy to part with two former first-round picks in Barkevious Mingo and Justin Gilbert. There\u2019s no depth at any position on defense and the offense isn\u2019t very explosive without Josh Gordon. The best thing that can happen for the Browns is landing Deshaun Watson with the first-overall pick next year. Photo: Steve DelVecchio / Larry Brown Sports / Yardbarker\n\nChip Kelly has gone from winning 10-plus games a year at Oregon to hoping he can lead San Francisco to a handful of wins. The 49ers arguably have the worst quarterback and wide receiver situations in the league, which means they\u2019re going to put up very few points this season. It\u2019s time for Kelly and the Niners to start over and land a franchise quarterback in the draft, because Blaine Gabbert and Colin Kaepernick aren't the answer.",

    "text": "Fixes looks at solutions to social problems and why they work.\n\nDavid Stojcevski died in jail in Macomb County, Mich., a far suburb of Detroit, last year. He was taking doctor-prescribed methadone and two anti-anxiety medicines to alleviate symptoms of drug withdrawal when he began a 30-day sentence in June 2014. His family alleges that officials at the jail did not respond to his pleas for his medicines. He began hallucinating and was placed in a special cell with 24-hour camera surveillance. (Local 4 television in Detroit first showed the video. A warning: Watching will produce nausea and outrage.) There he lay for 16 days, naked, on the floor. He lost 44 pounds. Finally he stopped breathing, was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead.\n\nGuards are required to monitor the cell cameras, taking notes every 15 minutes. They watched Stojcevski for days as he died.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a story about horrendous jail practices, although the lessons should be obvious. Rather, the point is that Stojcevski received a death sentence for a traffic ticket: He had been arrested for obstruction of justice when he couldn\u2019t pay a $772 fine for reckless driving.\n\nHis death is an extreme consequence of cash-register justice, a practice that ruins lives across the country every day in less dramatic ways.\n\nAnd this is a story about a possible remedy: Make fines proportional to an offender\u2019s ability to pay.\n\nAbout a dozen countries in Latin America and Europe use such fines, called day fines. In countries where their use has been studied, day fines have markedly reduced the number of people incarcerated, made the criminal justice system fairer and less abusive to the poor, lowered recidivism and saved government money.\n\nDay fines were tried in a handful of cities in the United States a quarter-century ago. They didn\u2019t catch on, in part because the political climate was uncongenial: It was the peak of lock-\u2019em-up sentiment. But America no longer wants to lock up every offender. Today, there is a rare bipartisan consensus on the harm created by mass incarceration.\n\nSo it\u2019s time to take a serious new look at the day fine.\n\nFirst, why we need it:\n\nIn America, people are routinely jailed for failure to pay fines. Since the 1990s, courts in many parts of the country have had to pay for themselves, or even support their cities, so fines can be exorbitant. Ferguson, Mo., is the most notorious example: \u201cFerguson\u2019s law enforcement practices are shaped by the city\u2019s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs,\u201d said the Justice Department\u2019s report on the police and courts in Ferguson.\n\nSomeone pulled over for a missing taillight can be given multiple fines, plus court fees that might equal or exceed the original fines. If the accused can\u2019t pay, her case may be turned over to a private company that supervises \u201cpay-only probation\u201d \u2014 bill collecting, really. The company collects the money and charges the offender for doing so. (Here\u2019s an excellent summary of the process, written in plain English.) The offender could pay off her whole fine and still owe thousands of dollars. If she doesn\u2019t pay, she could go to jail, which would probably mean losing her job.\n\nCash-register justice incarcerates or keeps on probation many people who are not dangerous, just poor. And taxpayers are being abused by legislators who keep heaping fees on offenders. The lawmakers are not considering the enormous cost of jailing those who can\u2019t pay, the cost of collecting their debts, or the cost to society of turning a civil violator into an incarcerated criminal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think legislators know this is not working \u2014 that the fees on the books are costing more money than they are bringing in,\u201d said Karin Martin, an assistant professor of public management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. The Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, for example, looked at the incarceration of 246 people in Mecklenburg County, N.C., who fell behind on their court debt. The county collected $33,476, but jailing them cost $40,000.\n\nLegislatures should not be making courts pay for themselves. It creates terrible injustice and ruins lives. It perverts justice by giving courts an incentive to convict. But if judicial systems are going to be made to pay their own way, it should be done fairly.\n\nOne way is to use the day fine. Rather than a set dollar amount, it is a percentage or multiple of an offender\u2019s daily income \u2014 hence the name. In some countries, \u201cdaily income\u201d is simply after-tax earnings. Others adjust for the number of dependents or fixed obligations like child support, and some consider only what is earned above a basic living allowance.\n\nIn the United States, for example, a very minor offense carrying a fine of one day\u2019s income might cost a minimum-wage earner $72 if based only on straight income, while someone with an annual income of $250,000 might pay $685. A more serious offense could carry a fine of 10 or 20 days\u2019 income, or more. For the system to function, additional court fees should also be proportional to income.\n\nDifferent fines for different people \u2014 is that fair? Compared with the current system, yes. Even $500 for a traffic fine and fees can ruin the life of a minimum-wage worker. For someone who makes $250,000 a year, that same fine is a minor inconvenience, and an ineffective deterrent to further violations. The rich are more likely to drive recklessly, and they can put a fine on a credit card without a thought. Same offense \u2013 two very different punishments.\n\nBut with a day fine, an offense would carry a similar punitive hit for rich and poor.\n\nGermany is probably the biggest user of day fines. In 1975, the government of what was then West Germany adopted the practice because it wanted to reduce prison overcrowding, and because research had shown that low-level offenders jailed for short times emerged more violent and dangerous. Offenders were no longer given short sentences, but rather fines that were adjusted for income.\n\nIn 2010, Germany used day fines in more than 94 percent of traffic offenses and in a vast majority of crimes that would otherwise have drawn short jail sentences, like fraud, embezzlement and theft.\n\nAn early study, published in 1980 by Hans-Jorg Albrecht of the Max Planck Institute, found that the fines were more effective than short sentences at preventing future offenses.\n\nSince day fines are calculated to be bearable, collection rates are much higher than with traditional fines. But they still require enforcement \u2013 in Germany\u2019s case by means of other civil (not criminal) sanctions like the seizure of property, the garnisheeing of wages or the imposition of a sentence of community service. Nonpayers go to jail very rarely.\n\nRead previous contributions to this series.\n\nDay fines were tried briefly in several American court systems at the close of the 1980s, led by the Vera Institute of Justice.\n\nRon Reinstein, at the time the presiding judge of the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Ariz., said the program in Phoenix was only \u201cmoderately successful.\u201d One obstacle was that judges had to give mandatory fines for drug possession; neither those fines nor court costs could be adjusted for income. Nor was everyone convinced of the project\u2019s importance. \u201cThere were some good results in the pilot, but there wasn\u2019t the commitment from everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prosecutors were not that interested.\u201d\n\nOn Staten Island in New York, Vera itself operated a day fines office in the court, where staff members interviewed defendants, calculated fines and managed collection. \u201cThe rate at which people paid in full shot up,\u201d said Judith Greene, at the time Vera\u2019s director of court programs. \u201cThe amount of money collected over all shot up.\u201d\n\nThe big challenge in administering day fines is determining an offender\u2019s income, since tax returns are not public. But that is true in Germany also, and the courts there find what they need. The police and courts routinely collect information that helps determine income. And they can simply ask the defendant. About half give information voluntarily. The police end up investigating in less than 2 percent of cases.\n\nProfessor Martin, of John Jay, wants to resume day fine experimentation in the United States \u2014 not just for traffic fines and minor infractions, but the way it works in Europe: as an alternative to jail for anyone who might get a short sentence. \u201cThis is the only way we\u2019re going to extricate ourselves from the horribly expensive and punitive system of punishing people with criminal justice debt,\u201d she said.\n\nOne question is whether the fines should have a cap. If they did, they would be less fair \u2014 the superrich would pay less, proportionally, than others. And that would bring in less money, although very few offenders have multimillion-dollar income. But a cap would have value in heading off a public relations disaster: those few enormous fines that might make the whole system look outrageous. The New York Times ran an article about day fines in Finland in April, focused tightly on a $58,000 speeding ticket issued to a businessman with an income of about $7 million a year and the public-relations campaign he started in retaliation.\n\nDay fines could keep offenders with modest means out of jail and at home, with their families and in their jobs. The system could save money by reducing incarceration and probation. Supervising offenders on probation is pricey, and leads to more incarceration \u2014 half of all the inmates in American jails are there for technical violations of parole or probation.\n\nPerhaps the most important advantage of day fines is this: The current system persists because it doesn\u2019t affect people of means and clout. Cash-register justice is a poor-person problem. But it won\u2019t change until it\u2019s also a rich-person problem. Then there will be political pressure to do something about America\u2019s counterproductive and unjust system of having defendants pay for our courts.\n\nJoin Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes.

    "text": "Arianna Huffington, the Huffington Post co-founder and editor in chief, is a regular on the morning TV circuit, a frequent public speaker and the author of 14 books. Her latest is a crash course in her philosophy that people should tweak their habits to become happier and more productive despite increasingly demanding lives.\n\nIn \"Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom and Wonder,\" she proposes a new way to measure achievement that goes beyond money and power.\n\nHuffington will give the keynote address at The Chicago Network\u2019s sold-out 25th annual Women in the Forefront Luncheon on Monday. An entrepreneur herself, Huffington says her tips apply to people at all stages, but especially those at the start of something new.\n\nQ. Why should an entrepreneur implement your suggestions?\n\nWe are living in a collective delusion that the way to build a successful startup is to burn out the founder. If you look at the fact that three-quarters of startups fail, I think there is a clear correlation between the failure rate and the burnout rate.\n\nAs entrepreneurs, the first thing we need to nurture is our human capital. If we are burnt out, we are going to make bad decisions. I never recommend not working hard. But if we don\u2019t have respite, pauses, renewal times, we basically become disconnected from our best ideas, our creativity and our wisdom. It\u2019s those things that lead to success.\n\nAs entrepreneurs, the two most important things are to be able to see around the corner and to be able to see the icebergs before they hit the Titanic. All that becomes harder if we\u2019re actually burned out and not operating at our best.\n\nQ. Sleep is something you promote a lot, but many founders don\u2019t get enough. How can they adopt new habits?\n\nThey can begin by gradually implementing small changes, beginning with getting 30 minutes more sleep each day. They don\u2019t have to go to seven to eight hours immediately. They will see how much more effective they are. Another thing that\u2019s really important is introducing even five minutes of silence or quiet time in our lives.\n\nQ. What practices should founders incorporate early on in order to build the right sort of culture at their companies?\n\nWhen they institute practices that really value their employees, they\u2019re going to get the best out of the people who work at the company, in terms of creativity, their smart ideas. At HuffPost, we\u2019ve introduced nap rooms, meditation, yoga, breathing classes, healthy snacks, paid time off to volunteer, email policies that allow people to be really off when they are off. Caring for the employees\u2019 well-being and caring for the bottom line are not contradictions.\n\nQ. Do you want people just to recharge, or to completely change the way they live?\n\nRecharging is just one of the steps to basically leading a life where we thrive and don\u2019t just strive. There\u2019s always going to be striving and hard work and big dreams. The book is absolutely encouraging people to have big dreams, things they want to accomplish, embrace hard work, but do it all in the context of thriving.\n\nQ. What if you don\u2019t have the resources to delegate to others?\n\nWhether you\u2019re struggling to put food on the table, struggling to make ends meet, or running a big corporation with endless demands on your time, the same rules apply. This is all about connecting to our best self. We have so much evidence that the people who are resilient, who are able to overcome all the challenges they\u2019re facing, are the ones who are connected with themselves.\n\nQ. You encourage people to disconnect from their phones when they\u2019re not working. Does this mean people should check their egos? Are they not as necessary or important as they think they are?\n\nOn the contrary, I\u2019m saying they're incredibly important. Because they\u2019re incredibly important, they need to be operating at their best.\n\nIf you look at athletes ... you see that elite athletes, at the top of their game, have completely integrated these practices into their coaching. They know it will make them more effective at winning.\n\nWhat is interesting here is that at the same time that this practice will make us better at jobs, at our startups, it will also make us realize that we are not defined by the business we are creating or the job we have, that we are more than that.\n\nQ. How do you implement these practices into a schedule as busy as yours?\n\nI have a lot of friends flying in from around the world for the Third Metric conference this week. I would love to have dinner with them on Wednesday night, but in fact there is a book party for me here (in New York) Wednesday night, 7 to 9, and at 9 o\u2019clock I\u2019m leaving and having an early night.\n\nMaking choices like that often means saying no to things you want to do because of the way you want to be the next day. I say that a good day begins the night before with decisions we make. For me, my time for going to bed is like my time for catching a plane. I take that time seriously.\n\nQ. What about the next day?\n\nI always start by meditating and doing some form of exercise or yoga, even if it\u2019s 15 minutes. These are my two definite things.\n\nQ. When do you first check your phone in the morning?\n\nAfter my meditation. It means that I don\u2019t start my day by responding, in a reactive mode, responding to the world, to requests, to questions. Any time we are on email, we are reacting. Very often, we may spend an entire day, week, month, year, just reacting and operating from our inbox rather than from what we want to create.\n\nQ. What about the person who works somewhere that doesn\u2019t value the Third Metric, but instead only the first two?\n\nRight now, we\u2019re in this major moment of transition. There are definitely employers who are still in the dark ages, but it\u2019s changing.\n\nQ and As are edited for clarity and length.",

    "text": "Here's the science behind how your phone battery works and a few tips for how to keep it charged longer. (American Chemical Society)\n\nWhenever a new iPhone gets announced, there's one feature that every Apple lover is hoping for: improved battery life. We may not agree on headphone jacks, but we all want smartphones that can hold more juice. How else are we supposed to catch all those Pok\u00e9mon?\n\nThe latest video from the American Chemical Society gives some tips for making your battery last longer \u2014 all informed by chemistry, of course.\n\n[Astronaut Chris Hadfield on aliens, the Arctic and his fear of the dark]\n\nSmartphones like the iPhone use lithium-ion batteries. They're super light and can hold charges longer than other types of batteries, but they also start degrading as soon as they're manufactured. Your smartphone battery will get worse and worse over time and eventually die (though let's be honest, you'll probably shatter the screen way before then). There's no avoiding its eventual demise. But you can delay the inevitable.\n\nFirst, let's dispel some myths: You don't need to let your electronics power all the way down before you recharge them. This \"fact\" is actually a holdover from the days when nickel-based batteries reigned supreme. Those batteries experience something called the \"memory effect,\" where a battery that isn't fully discharged will \"forget\" some of its capacity if it recharges with a partially full battery. It's as if you had three eggs in your fridge, leaving nine empty spaces in your nifty little egg holder, but went to the store and only bought six eggs to fill those spots. Nine empty spaces in the morning, nine total eggs after your shopping trip. But wait! Your egg holder can hold 12 eggs. Disaster.\n\n[Watch these leaping electric eels validate one of science history\u2019s wackiest stories]\n\nJust as you could remedy this ridiculous egg distribution by buying an even dozen after using up that pesky nine, nickel batteries could generally \"remember\" their full capacity by being drained down to zero and starting over.\n\nOne of the advantages of lithium-ion batteries is that they aren't as forgetful as our hypothetical egg eater. So there's no need to drain your battery to zero.\n\nIn fact, as the video above explains, you're better off keeping your battery right around a 50-percent sweet spot. As Eric Limer explained for Popular Mechanics, a lithium-ion battery's charge capacity is determined by how many lithium ions it can nestle into its two electrodes. As you go through charging cycles, these components degrade and hold fewer ions. Battery University recommends partial discharges, because it's more taxing on your phone's battery to start from zero. If you constantly drain it down to nothing, your battery will lose its capacity much more quickly.\n\nThe iPhone 6 is almost here and the preorders are piling up. But what do you really know about the insides of the iPhone 6, or any smartphone for that matter? (Courtesy of the American Chemical Society)\n\nBut heat is the real lithium-ion killer. Heat speeds up all chemical reactions, and the ones inside your battery are no exception. Not only can heat speed up the process of battery drainage in the short term, but it can also cause the battery to degrade and hold fewer ions. Even the heat of your body is enough to help kill a battery quicker \u2014 so try to keep your phone out of your pockets.\n\nAnd finally, if you need to put your phone away for a while and don't want it to die completely, charge it to around 50 percent before you turn it off. A battery with no charge can become unstable or even explode, so smartphones and laptops have a fail-safe that kills their batteries if they're uncharged for ages and ages. It's a pain in the neck, but it's better than a phone explosion.\n\nOn that note, consider this a reminder to turn in your Galaxy Note 7. The phones have been recalled for having a small battery fault that may occasionally cause them to burst into flames. To protect users who may fail to respond to Samsung's recall, the company is issuing a software update that will keep phone batteries at a lackluster 60 percent charge or lower \u2014 presumably to avoid overheating.\n\nBees\u2019 secret superpower explained: How they sense flowers\u2019 electric fields\n\nMajor earthquakes might be caused by the moon\n\nAstronaut Chris Hadfield on aliens, the Arctic and his fear of the dark",

Or, rather, they acquire their power through the contradictions they deftly reconcile. One especially striking example: a photograph from 1930 (slide 11 in this gallery) comprised of elements so incongruous that, taken together, they really should not bear scrutiny for more than a few moments before the viewer, shrugging indifferently, moves on.\n\nBut through Evans\u2019 uncanny visual alchemy, that particular photograph\u2019s disparate graphic elements\u2014family photos; a half-hidden American flag; dried flowers; a truly hideous plant growing with almost unseemly vitality from a battered wooden bucket\u2014appear not only to belong together, but to need one another in order to make sense.\n\nAs seemingly chaotic and even unappealing as the image might feel at first glance, those wildly variant aspects of the photo\u2014the flag, the plant, the faces\u2014somehow cohere into something far more than the sum of their parts. Despite its initially jarring message, \u201cInterior Detail of Portuguese House\u201d does not, in fact, spurn scrutiny\u2014it commands, and rewards, scrutiny. And what\u2019s more amazing is that, after a time, the photograph appears to be gazing back. It is the viewer, and not the picture, that is the subject of an unblinking inquiry\u2014and it\u2019s unsettling.\n\nBut if Evans\u2019 pictures are evidence of a rare facility for both creating and resolving contradictions, his career might be seen as his masterpiece. A fierce, determined artist, Walker Evans was for decades on staff at Time Inc.\u2014a salaried editor at, of all places, Fortune magazine from the 1940s until the mid-1960s. That the man behind one of the seminal photographic efforts of the 20th century\u2014the 1938 masterwork, American Photographs\u2014went to the office each day, like any other nine-to-fiver, might astonish those photography buffs who have always, understandably, imagined Evans as nothing if not an irresistible creative force.\n\nAnd yet, here again, Evans\u2019 intrinsic contradictions\u2014managed as Rodin might handle a lump of clay, or Koufax a curveball\u2014are ultimately resolved in the photographs, singly and collectively, that he produced. He is both iconoclast and working stiff; company man and virtuoso.\n\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary edition of American Photographs, reissued by the Museum of Modern Art in an edition that recaptures, for the first time since its original release, what might be called the book\u2019s radical purity. (The book itself, as a physical object, is a pleasure to hold; the duotone plates are gorgeous and crisp, and the size of this edition\u2014an at-once solid and easily handled 7.75\u2033 x 8.75\u2033 hardcover\u2014does justice to the serious, unfussy, thrilling nature of the work inside.)\n\nAs in the first edition, Evans\u2019 pictures in the MoMa release appear only on the right-hand side as one turns each page, the utterly blank page on the left\u2014without even a caption to distract the eye\u2014adjuring one to look, to really look, at each picture, one after the other. And as the pages (slowly, slowly) turn, Evans\u2019 accomplishment grows more evident, more impressive, more engaging.\n\nThe standard line on Evans is that no one\u2014with a camera or a paintbrush\u2014had ever captured America in quite the clear-eyed, unsentimental, honest way that he did. But that patently true declaration still fails to encompass the scale and the sustained excellence of his achievement. In American Photographs, in images made during the Great Depression in places as divergent as Pennsylvania, Alabama, New York City and Havana, Cuba, Evans did not hold a mirror up to his country and his time: no mirror ever made, after all, could so clearly reflect what he saw, and what he wanted others to see.\n\nInstead, each and every one of Evans\u2019 pictures provides a window\u2014or an unadorned window frame\u2014from which even the glass has been removed, and through which we witness a scene of such clarity and immediacy that our own contemporary surroundings, if only for a moment, seem somehow less freighted with history. Less grounded. Less real.\n\nThe details of a house in Maine (slide 17)\u2014the surprisingly jaunty, seemingly tilted windows; the elegant shapes, graceful patterns and, above all, the textures that give the structure its personality\u2014are not merely the handiwork of people who obviously cared about their hard work; the details of the house are reminders of, and tributes to, the enduring value of hard work and the attention to craft.\n\nThe stance, the clothing and the unreadable expression on the face of a lean, dapper citizen of Havana in 1932 (slide 9) are not merely separate elements of a snapshot: like the details of a portrait by an Old Master, they combine to suggest a time, a place and an attitude (defiant, dignified) that have survived the passing decades intact\u2014even if, by now, the man himself must be long dead.\n\nThese pictures, and the other pictures in American Photographs, are intensely daring precisely because the man who made them worked so hard to hide\u2014to efface\u2014the effort that went into creating them. Each image stands on its own, while at the same time each picture references the photograph that comes before, and the photograph that follows. It is a straightforward book that stirs complex emotions. It is a treasure.\n\n\u2018Walker Evans: American Photographs (Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Edition)\u2019 is available through the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nBen Cosgrove is the editor of LIFE.com.",

    "text": "NEW ORLEANS \u2013 Isaac's battering winds began to soften a bit as the weather system slowly marched north but rescue crews stayed busy across the region, helping residents escape flooded neighborhoods and dealing with incessant rains.\n\nThe hurricane-protection system ringing the New Orleans area continued to hold, keeping storm surge and floodwaters out of the city. But in the New Orleans suburbs of LaPlace and Slidell, rescue crews were helping residents evacuate from flooded homes.\n\nA Coast Guard helicopter crew rescued a couple and their two dogs from a flooded house early Thursday morning in LaPlace, Coast Guard officials said in a press statement.\n\nA crew from the Coast Guard Air Station in New Orleans hoisted the husband and wife into an MH-65C Dolphin helicopter after receiving a report around midnight that the couple had been stranded.\n\n\"The husband and wife and their two dogs were in an area where a lot of houses washed away,\" said Lt. Cmdr. Jorge Porto, Air Station New Orleans pilot. \"They used a flashlight inside the house as a signaling device, which made all the difference in locating them effectively.\"\n\nAcross Lake Pontchartrain in St. Tammany Parish, residents were also fleeing flooded neighborhoods.\n\nHomes along Interstate 55 near New Orleans were steeped in floodwaters up to the roof awnings. One sheriff's deputy's car was stranded in floodwater near the highway.\n\nIsaac hadn't completely loosened its grip on the region yet: Area rivers, steadily swelling with Isaac's rains, weren't expected to crest until the weekend, potentially flooding more homes and making more roads impassable, said Capt. Doug Cain, Louisiana State Police spokesman.\n\n\"We still have some challenges ahead of us,\" he said.\n\nVideos of Tropical Storm Isaac\n\nAs of Thursday morning, about 7,000 residents across southern Louisiana had evacuated to shelters, said Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. State officials were still staging emergency crews in affected parishes to help in rescue missions, she said.\n\n\"A lot of it depends where the water goes now,\" she said. \"And of course we're still having weather.\"\n\nLouisiana State Police stayed busy clearing roadways and making streets safer. More than 30 roadways across southern Louisiana had closed because of Isaac, including stretches of major thoroughfares such as Interstate 10, U.S. 61 and U.S. 90, Cain said.\n\nState troopers are also tasked with helping local police secure homes and businesses, he said. So far, only a few isolated cases of looting have been reported.\n\n\"In the big picture, it's been minimal,\" Cain said. \"We've been very happy with that.\"\n\nSeven years to the day Hurricane Katrina destroyed much of New Orleans and caused hundreds of deaths, Isaac \u2014 downgraded to a tropical storm on Wednesday \u2014 is proving far less destructive, but still capable of roiling mayhem. At least two storm-related deaths were reported in Louisiana and Mississippi. Nearly 700,000 homes and businesses in Louisiana and Mississippi were without power late Wednesday. Airline, rail and automotive traffic was expected to remain snarled across several states through week's end.\n\nDespite Isaac's waning force, the storm is still expected to dump up to another 15 inches of rainfall over parts of the Gulf Coast region and will plow into the nation's heartland, drenching states as far north as Ohio.\n\n\"The category of the storm doesn't capture all of the hazards,\" said Rick Knabb, director of the National Hurricane Center. \"Take this one very seriously. It's going to take a while for this to spin down. We're still way early before this is all over.\"\n\nPresident Obama declared federal emergencies in Louisiana and Mississippi late Wednesday, according to a statement from the White House. The disaster declarations free up federal aid for affected areas.\n\nParts of New Orleans have already been pounded with up to 17 inches of rain.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this is a storm that just won't seem to leave us,\" said New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who ordered a dusk-to-dawn curfew. \"This is not the time to let your guard down. We're still in this thing, so it's more important than ever for residents to stay vigilant and remain calm.\"\n\nFlights to and from New Orleans were canceled for a second straight day Wednesday. Airports in other Gulf cities as far east as Pensacola, Fla., were closed. Southwest Airlines said all of its New Orleans flights were suspended at least through 5 p.m. Thursday. The vast number of cancellations \u2014 and the storm's trajectory \u2014 could cause travel delays across the nation heading into Labor Day weekend.\n\n\"We'll be dealing with this storm through early Friday morning,\" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said.\n\nMost of Lakeshore Drive along New Orleans' Lake Pontchartrain is closed to traffic, but the storm surge remained below the levees. The Army Corps of Engineers' $14.45 billion overhaul of the area's hurricane protection system was holding back surges and floodwaters, said Bob Turner, regional director of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East.\n\nThroughout the New Orleans area, neighborhoods swallowed by Katrina's catastrophic floods were drenched by Isaac but spared major flooding. The Lake Borgne surge barrier, a $1 billion structure erected after Katrina, stopped a 15-foot storm surge headed to the Lower 9th Ward\u2014 perhaps the hardest hit area in 2005 \u2014 and other parts of the city.\n\nWithout that 26-foot-high barrier, storm water would have topped levees and flooded neighborhoods ravaged by floods during Katrina, he said. \"You would have had water flowing in the Lower 9th Ward again,\" Turner said. \"The barrier did its job.\"\n\nLower 9th Ward resident Gloria Guy spent 9\u00bd hours on the roof of her flooded home during Katrina before she was rescued. On Wednesday, Guy said she had mostly slept through Isaac in a home built after Katrina by actor Brad Pitt's Make It Right Foundation.\n\n\"Much better than Katrina,\" said Guy, 72. \"Besides not having any lights, everything's fine.\"\n\nEven so, some areas were hit hard. Along the shores of Lake Ponchartrain just north of New Orleans, officials sent scores of buses and high-water vehicles to help evacuate about 3,000 people as rising waters lapped against houses and left cars stranded. Floodwaters rose waist-high in some neighborhoods, and the Louisiana National Guard was working with sheriff's deputies to rescue people stranded in their homes.\n\nRescue crews were tending to stranded residents in Plaquemines and St. John the Baptist parishes, both on the outskirts of New Orleans. Braithwaite, a small enclave of Plaquemines just on the outside of a giant floodgate, received the brunt of Isaac's wrath when a failed levee sent floodwaters into homes. Rescue crews retrieved several dozen residents from rooftops.\n\nThe storm pushed water over an 18-mile levee and put so much pressure on it that state officials were considering puncturing the flood wall to relieve the strain, Jindal said Wednesday.\n\nLouisiana National Guard troops, sheriff's deputies and rescue teams from the state's Wildlife and Fisheries department with high-water vehicles and 10 boats converged in a staging area near the gate keeping the floodwaters back. But gusty winds continued to hamper rescue efforts.\n\nJust on the other side of the gate from Braithwaite and inside the hurricane protection system, David Manes, 33, rode out the storm at home with his three young sons. Isaac's winds snapped trees in half and peeled back some of his roof's overhang. Isaac's muscle caught Manes off guard.\n\n\"It wasn't supposed to be this bad,\" he said. \"If I had known it would've been this bad, I would've stayed with my mother in Mississippi.\"\n\nNorthern Plaquemines Parish is ringed by a hurricane protection system of fortified levees and flood walls. But stretches on the east bank of the Mississippi River and further south lie outside the protection system, making it still vulnerable to storm surge and flooding, Parish Councilman Kirk Lepine said.\n\n\"It came in at the worse scenario we can imagine,\" Lepine said. \"There's nowhere for that water to go than here.\"\n\nNew Orleans' historic French Quarter appeared to have dodged the worst of Isaac. Downed tree limbs, minor flooding at intersections and a brief electrical outage overnight were the main problems confronting the residents stayed.\n\n\"Honestly, man, it's just been rain,\" said Huggington \"Huggy\" Behr, manager of Flanagan's Pub, which remained open through the night. \"To us, we've seen the worst, so it's business as usual.\"\n\nNew Orleans businesses fretted that the lingering storm would hamper this weekend's three-day Southern Decadence gay celebration, which organizers say draws up to 100,000 visitors. Round-the-clock activities are scheduled, mostly around the dozen French Quarter bars and adjoining neighborhood.\n\nSharon Senner, owner of Chateau Hotel in the Quarter, said all 49 rooms were fully booked for the weekend, but half the guests canceled or inquired about canceling.\n\nCraig Fugate, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said weather conditions continue to worsen in the northern Louisiana, delaying storm damage assessments, power restoration and relief efforts.\n\nThe Red Cross\u2014 already housing 5,000 evacuees in 80 statewide shelters \u2014 is preparing a prolonged recovery. \"We're going to be there for weeks,\" Red Cross vice president Charles Shimanski said. \"We need to know what we're recovering from before we know what recovery looks like.\"\n\nNear Baton Rouge, westbound traffic on Interstate 10 was diverted because of an overturned truck east of Whiskey Bay. \"There's no reason an 18-wheeler should be traveling through this weather with 70 mph gusts,\" Trooper Russell Graham said.\n\nMore than half a million Louisiana homes and businesses lost power and most will stay that way for at least several days, Entergy spokesman Chanel Lagarde said.\n\nThe company, which serves most of Louisiana, initially planned to dispatch 4,000 workers to repair fallen power lines once the storm passed. Now, with outages so widespread and spreading northward, Entergy said it will need 10,000 workers.\n\n\"The one thing that's really hampering us is that the winds are still here,\" Lagarde said.\n\nEntergy expects it will take \"several days\" before the company can restore power to most of its customers.\n\nIsaac will never compare to Katrina's ferocity, but its slow, wobbly march north is prolonging another round of agony for thousands along the Gulf Coast.\n\nFor Abbie West, it could mark the end of her run in the southern Mississippi town she chose for her retirement.\n\nIn her younger years, West says she was a burlesque performer in New Orleans. After her husband died in 2001, she retired and moved to the waterfront community of Waveland in southwest Mississippi, into what she called her \"dream home.\"\n\nKatrina destroyed that house. And now, West hears that Isaac has flooded the trailer she bought to replace it with at least five feet of water.\n\n\"I've gone through four hurricanes now since I moved here,\" said West, now 82, as she waits for the floodwaters to recede in a motel five miles from her home. \"I don't know what I'm going to do. I have no idea.\"\n\nA few doors down, Morris and Dottie Treadway are facing a similar dilemma.\n\nThe couple is used to change. In the 55 years they've been married, they've had 58 addresses because of his varied career.\n\nHe served six years in the Air Force. He managed Pizza Hut franchises in Canada. He was a councilman in Plaquemines Parish, La., and was a machinist who helped build the Saturn booster rockets that launched Apollo astronauts to the moon. He says he owned the \"biggest country-western saloon in upstate New York\" for a few years.\n\nSo the couple was crushed when the house they built together in Waveland was destroyed by Katrina. They rebuilt it, but now, with no idea how much damage Isaac has wreaked, they're wondering if it's time to move again.\n\n\"No,\" Dottie said. \"It's life.\"\n\n\"I'm tired of it,\" Morris said. \"I'd go a little farther north.\"\n\nBecause the floodwaters had not receded by Wednesday night, it was impossible to know how many Waveland homes were flooded by Isaac.\n\nEmergency officials said all 43 people saved by rescue crews on boats in Mississippi came from that area. After touring Waveland, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said the area produced some of the highest storm surges in the state.\n\n\"It was 10 foot below the high point of Katrina, which was 28 feet, so you could see how much water is in that area,\" he said.\n\nMississippi hasn't fully assessed Isaac's damage.\n\nGov. Phil Bryant said the state has been fortunate so far, with no reports of injuries or deaths through Wednesday afternoon. But he worried that people were acting too casual as the weakened storm moved further west. With Isaac's winds keeping the storm surge close to 10 feet throughout the coast, up to 3 inches of rain falling per hour and tornadoes spotted throughout the state, he urged people to stay inside.\n\n\"The surge continues. Unfortunately so does the rain and the wind,\" he said from an emergency operations center in Gulfport. \"People appear to be almost ignoring the tornado warnings. This is a very dangerous situation.\"\n\nSeventy roads were closed near the coast and rescue crews on boats and National Guard trucks had rescued 58 people. Most of those rescues were in Hancock County, which borders Louisiana, where flooding was widespread.\n\nMississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) Director Robert Latham said some houses that are flooded there were built on stilts after Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\"That shows you the significant height of the water,\" Latham said. \"The storm surge may recede, but we've got a lot of rainfall still coming down that's going to keep those water levels pretty high.\"\n\n\"We really don't have a clue on damages yet,\" said MEMA spokesman Jeff Rent. \"The storm is moving so slowly that it's going to be a while before we get out there to assess it. I can tell you've we've had a lot of roads in our coast counties that have closed due to debris and flooding.\"\n\nForecasters expected Isaac to move inland over the next several days, dumping rain on drought-stricken states across the nation's midsection before finally breaking up over the weekend.",

Miller, the chief executive of Gazprom, said in a statement on Wednesday, and had cut the flow of natural gas to Ukraine immediately.\n\n\u201cGazprom will not deliver gas to Ukraine at any price without prepayment,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\n\nOne day earlier, Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state energy company, said it would cease buying Russian gas because of disputes over prices and the breakdown of talks mediated by the European Union to negotiate a new contract.\n\nRussia briefly cut natural gas supplies to Ukraine in June 2014 amid a growing conflict between the Ukrainian Army and pro-Russian separatists in southeastern Ukraine after the ouster of the president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. Disputes over gas prices between Russia and Ukraine had also led to shut-offs in 2006 and 2008.\n\nGazprom, which is controlled by the Russian government, raised prices on gas after Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s ouster. On Monday, the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, announced a third-quarter gas price of $247.18 per thousand cubic meters for Ukraine, close to a $40 discount on Russia\u2019s benchmark price. Previously, Russia had given the Ukrainians a $100 discount on the gas price, partly in exchange for leasing rights to the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Crimea. That discount was canceled after Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014.\n\nAnalysts say that Ukraine has sufficient stores of gas to make it through the summer, when consumption is low. Ukraine has claimed that it can supplement its supplies by purchasing Russian gas exported to other countries, like Slovakia.\n\nIldar Davletshin, an oil and gas analyst at Renaissance Capital, noted that the instability in Ukraine would most likely delay a long-term agreement over gas supplies from Russia.\n\n\u201cPossibly Russia does not want to increase its exposure to Ukraine, the risk of growing loans,\u201d Mr. Davletshin said. \u201cAlso, they can use this as a way to put some pressure on the Ukrainian government.\u201d\n\nUkraine is a transit corridor for Russian gas exports to the European Union, but Mr. Davletshin said the supply cut had \u201cno critical implications short term in terms of consumption or gas flow to Europe.\u201d He added that Ukraine would likely have to strike a deal in the fall in order to replenish stores of natural gas before colder temperatures set in.",

    "text": "Talk about the Wild West.Imagine officials of more than 200 local home-rule units of government in Illinois \u2014 trustees, aldermen, councilors, commissioners, most of them part-timers \u2014 suddenly and urgently attempting to craft and pass a new ordinance to allow their constituents to carry concealed weapons in public.Who is entitled to a permit? What training will it take to get a permit and who will provide and authorize it? Will permit-holders be able to carry their weapons on buses and trains? In taverns? In parks? In hospitals?\n\nAnd so on. More than 200 political brush fires on one of our most divisive, contentious public policy issues breaking out all over the state nearly all at once. To be followed, inevitably, by nearly as many lawsuits filed by those who feel that the new laws continue to violate the Second Amendment's guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms.Is that what we want? Because that's what many observers think we're going to get if the bickering Illinois General Assembly fails to agree on a concealed carry law by the June 9 deadline imposed late last year by a federal court.\n\nA quick review: On Dec. 11, a 2-1 majority of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals examined the implications of two recent U.S. Supreme Court gun-control decisions and ruled that \"the constitutional right of armed self-defense is broader than the right to have a gun in one's home. ... To confine the right to be armed to the home is to divorce the Second Amendment from the right of self-defense described (in 2008 and 2010 by the Supreme Court).\n\nThe court stayed its order tossing out our state's prohibition on concealed carry and gave lawmakers 180 days \"to craft a new gun law that will impose reasonable limitations, consistent with the public safety and the Second Amendment.\"\n\nHow hard could this be, given that the other 49 states have already shown the way? You'd be surprised. Gun control perhaps more than any other issue exposes the divides in Illinois politics \u2014 upstate/downstate; urban/rural/suburban; Democratic and Republican.\n\nThe debate has been lurching along, with competing proposals emerging that are best described as more permissive \u2014 the House version \u2014 and more restrictive the Senate version. A Senate committee rejected the House version Tuesday and few observers think the Senate version has a prayer of passing in the House.\n\nAn emerging school of thought has it that a stalemate will benefit those who favor the Senate proposal, which would allow for different rules in different parts of the state.\n\nAs Senate President John Cullerton put it recently, \"If we don't pass a bill in Springfield, (then) the city of Chicago, county of Cook, 208 home-rule units can pass their own legislation. So, while we should pass a sensible bill ... if we don't it's not the end of the world.\"\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker Michael Madigan said researchers in his chamber determined that about half of our home-rule communities already have their own unlawful-use-of-weapons laws on the books, many of which simply reiterate the existing state ban on concealed carry.\n\nSince the federal court ruling dealt only with the state law, those nearly identical local laws would remain in force after June 9, according to an analysis by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan's office. If no state law is passed by June 9, the question will automatically revert on June 10 to the district courts, which will be tasked with crafting injunctions that incorporate the federal court's ruling.\n\nGun-control advocates should not be optimistic, as the Wild West shootouts in municipal halls and county buildings up and down the state will not go well in most cases. The federal court ruling is strongly worded, and the scores of local political fights over concealed carry will be skewed by the notable and persistent enthusiasm gap that has long advantaged those who favor the expansion of gun rights.\n\nThe strictest of any new patchwork gun laws aren't likely to survive court scrutiny, and the loosest ones seem destined to take hold.\n\nIf the Illinois Senate can get a few modifications on the House bill \u2014 getting rid of the sweeping pre-emption on all local firearms ordinances, for instance \u2014 it should take the deal before it gets outta Dodge at the end of the week.\n\nAn unsatisfying bill will be better than no bill at all.\n\nHow many home-rule units are there in Illinois? House Speaker Michael Madigan has referred to 220, Senate President Cullerton says 208 (see the quote above). The Illinois Municipal League told me 209 and the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois puts the number at 206\n\nRefresher: Highlights of the federal court's concealed-carry decision\n\nLatest news: Compromise may be close on concealed carry bill\n\nSenate Republican leader Christine Radogno of Lemont said she sensed the sides were getting \"closer.\" She cast a \"present\" vote on the bill Cullerton favored to encourage negotiations.The National Rifle Association registered as \"neutral\" on the less restrictive Madigan-backed bill but opposed the more restrictive version sponsored by Sen. Kwame Raoul, D-Chicago.Raoul included a provision that would not allow concealed weapons in any bar, restaurant or establishment where alcoholic beverages are consumed. The House bill allowed concealed carry in some such places, depending on the amount of booze sold.",

    "text": "\u201cThey feel confident that they don\u2019t have to compromise.\u201d\n\n-- An attendee of a White House briefing for liberal activists and union leaders on the state of negotiations with Republicans over looming federal tax increases and spending cuts, talking to Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent.\n\nIs President Obama willing to jump the \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d as many of his supporters are hoping he will?\n\nIt depends on what your definition of \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d is.\n\nThe White House takes a limited view of the current budget and tax impasse, casting it as a short-term conflict over the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that are looming at the end of the year.\n\nDefined that way, the president does seem willing to allow the across-the-board tax increases and spending cuts to kick in at the end of the year if House Republicans refuse to allow tax rates to go up for top earners.\n\nObama is treating the negotiations over tax rates and spending as a continuation of the debt-ceiling fight that created the automatic spending cuts in the first place.\n\nHaving won re-election and with current tax rates set to expire, Obama is looking to do a deal limited in scope to those issues. If Republicans would like to avoid automatic, long-term reductions in defense spending, Obama believes that the money should come from higher rates for top earners.\n\nAnd if Republicans won\u2019t agree, Obama is sending strong signals that he will let the hikes and cuts occur and then resume negotiations amid a deeper crisis.\n\nThis view casts Obama and House Speaker John Boehner as two bomb makers trying to diffuse an explosive device of their own creation. And if Boehner won\u2019t agree to change the wiring, Obama seems content to let the thing blow and then cast the blame on the House GOP.\n\nRepublicans, though, have a broader view of what\u2019s dangling on the cliff. Rather than just making changes to the previous deals on taxes and spending, Republicans would like to see a larger discussion about the long-term drivers of the debt, entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.\n\nObama, though, is looking for a win on current tax rates, which he doubtless hopes will spur a vicious intra-party fight among his adversaries, and then take up entitlement issues once beyond the blast radius of the year-end crisis.\n\nHe wants Republicans to gag on the tax hikes and then negotiate on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security with the pressure of an economically catastrophic batch of hikes and cuts.\n\nRepublicans believe that if they go into the fight over entitlements without the urgency of taxes and cuts driving the discussion, it will be impossible to get Democrats to do anything on the subject of the big three entitlements.\n\nBut there is a lot more dangling on Dec. 31 than just current tax rates and the start of the automatic reductions.\n\nThe short-term fight also includes other matters, like postponing again long-scheduled cuts in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals and avoidance of the imposition of a minimum tax rate. Both side generally want to avoid these, which have functioned as annual mini-cliffs for decades.\n\nThere\u2019s also the legislation to lift the federal government\u2019s borrowing limit, set to breach its current $16.4 trillion limit sometime around February.\n\nTeam Obama would like to see the borrowing hike and the annual delays of the Medicare cuts and minimum tax rolled into one year-end package: rack up some wins on the short-term issues and then deal with entitlements and larger issues on tax reform at a later date.\n\nIn essence, he wants Republicans to give him his way now in exchange for consideration of their issues at a later date. Republicans know this would be a very terrible way to negotiate.\n\nTheir idea of avoiding the fiscal cliff is one more extension of the status quo \u2013 setting a new deadline that would allow negotiators time to hash out a big, multi-trillion-dollar plan early next year.\n\nBoth sides know that an across-the-board tax hike would be bad for the economy and it would also be the strongest sign yet that Washington is unable to deal with even small fiscal concerns, let alone reducing the debt or balancing budgets. Or even passing budgets, for that matter.\n\nWhile Republicans know that they would be punished in the press if they refuse to back a tax hike now, Obama knows that his own party will not accept any deals on rates for top earners.\n\nPlus, Obama means to win the fiscal fight that dominated most of his presidency \u2013 his push for higher rates for top earners. He means to win, and as much he knows it would trigger an economic downturn, he is already heading out on the campaign trail to make sure that the Republicans get the blame.\n\nAnd since the Democratic Senate wouldn\u2019t pass a full extension of current rates, the president knows he would never have to sign the veto that triggered the tax hikes. They would just occur without him doing anything.\n\nRepublicans who are talking about their openness to more taxes are talking about them in the context of a trade-off for entitlement reforms. The president seems ever more determined to make higher taxes a stand-alone issue, even if it means putting the car back in the ditch.\n\nAnd Now, A Word From Charles \u201cThis is a political attack on Republicans. There is no evidence right now that he has any interest from the real fiscal issue because he would have to talk about the spending and entitlements, and he isn't.\u201d -- Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News, and his POWER PLAY column appears Monday-Friday on FoxNews.com.

    "text": "Jane Brody on health and aging.\n\nI don\u2019t need a calendar to know that a new year has begun. I can tell by the deluge of new diet books that arrive in the office mail \u2014 more than two dozen since mid-December. On a whim, I weighed them all: over 25 pounds of mostly bad advice, about as much as many readers hope to lose before they have to shed the concealing garb of winter.\n\nChoices include a low-carb plan that promises a loss of \u201cup to 15 pounds in two weeks\u201d in \u201cThe New Atkins Made Easy,\u201d or the Paleo diet in \u201cCavewomen Don\u2019t Get Fat.\u201d One Dr. Mike Moreno recommends occasional fasting \u201cto power boost your weight loss\u201d in \u201cThe 17 Day Diet Breakthrough Edition.\u201d\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re more interested in unearthing the secrets of the world\u2019s leanest people in \u201cBurn the Fat, Feed the Muscle,\u201d or learning to identify and curb emotional eating as described in \u201cWeight Loss for People Who Feel Too Much\u201d and \u201cOvercoming Binge Eating for Dummies.\u201d How about activating \u201cyour body\u2019s ability to burn fat and lose weight fast\u201d via \u201cThe Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet\u201d?\n\nIt goes on and on.\n\nI know about the new year, too, from comments in the Y locker room: The holiday splurges are over, and the day of reckoning has arrived. Overheard on Jan. 1: \u201cI\u2019m going to work out every day. I\u2019ve got to get rid of these pounds.\u201d\n\nBut neither the plethora of diet books nor annual resolutions are good predictors of permanent weight loss. First, if any of the scores of diet plans published in recent years had resulted in lasting weight loss for the growing legions of hopefuls, there would have been no need for yet another batch, including the ones that inevitably will arrive next December.\n\nSecond, as one middle-aged Y member, who has maintained a 20-pound weight loss for several years, responded to the locker room workout pledge: \u201cExercise by itself won\u2019t do it. To lose weight, you have to eat less.\u201d\n\nShe learned that, she said, at Weight Watchers after nearly wearing out her body by trying to lose weight through exercise alone. Not only does she now eat less, she also eats differently, having replaced many foods and snacks high in sugar and refined starches with more nutritious fare.\n\nAnother Weight Watchers success, a friend in his late 70s who shed 25 pounds, eats the same foods he always did but now eats less of them. He learned to recognize satiety \u2014 a feeling that he\u2019s had enough \u2014 and to rely on that instead of a feeling of being stuffed to signal the end of his meals.\n\nClearly, there is no one pathway to permanent weight loss that works for everyone. The latest guidelines for physicians, who are repeatedly exhorted to help overweight and obese patients lose pounds and keep them off, emphasize that a reduced-calorie diet should be based on individual dietary preferences and combined with \u201ccomprehensive lifestyle interventions\u201d that would best include participation in a professionally led program for six months or longer.\n\nRadical, abrupt dietary changes rarely stick. People soon tire of the restrictions and revert to their old dietary habits. Habits are not acquired overnight, and you should not expect to inculcate new ones overnight, either.\n\nJohn P. Foreyt, director of the Behavioral Medicine Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine, advises would-be dieters to first become aware of their bad eating and exercise habits, and then to figure out ways to slowly change them into healthier new ones.\n\nSmall changes can end up making a big difference. One is to avoid skipping meals. Eat a nutritious breakfast every day and a wholesome snack or meal every few hours. I snack on nuts midmorning and have a digestive biscuit (70 calories) with caf\u00e9 con leche midafternoon. The idea is to avoid becoming ravenous and losing control over your intake at the next meal.\n\nEat slowly \u2014 it takes 20 minutes for your brain to register satiety \u2014 and on smaller plates filled with one-fifth to one-third less food than usual. Fill most of the plate with foods like vegetables and salads that are rich in nutrients rather than calories.\n\nChoose nutrient-dense carbohydrates like beans and whole grains over refined ones. If, however, you think a meal is not a meal without potatoes, rice, bread or (heaven forfend) dessert, by all means include them \u2014 but in controlled amounts.\n\nDrink water or a calorie-free beverage with your meals. If you drink alcohol, limit yourself to one drink a day.\n\nI crave something sweet after a meal, and fruit doesn\u2019t always cut it. My dessert favorites include a graham cracker (65 calories in two squares) and two dark chocolate Bahlsen Afrika biscuits (45 calories).\n\nIf, like me, you have an oral fixation, try chewing sugar-free gum. Or eat a fruit like an apricot or prunes with pits, then suck on the pits for the next hour or so.\n\nMake physical exercise a daily activity. Decide each day what to do rather than whether to do it. The 4,200 members of the National Weight Control Registry (members have lost an average of 67 pounds and kept them off for six years) typically exercise for 60 to 90 minutes a day, often broken up into several smaller sessions; walking is their most popular activity.\n\nRegistry leaders report that those who have successfully maintained their weight loss typically eat a diet low in fat (25 percent of daily calories) and high in carbohydrates, with 56 percent of their calories from carbs like whole grains, beans and vegetables.\n\nPerhaps most telling is that registry members weigh themselves regularly. Many (like me) get on a scale every day. A weekly weigh-in, as recommended by Weight Watchers, is probably best while losing weight. But to maintain weight, a daily check can provide an early warning to cut back a little when you gain a pound or two. Five extra pounds that make pants too tight are a lot harder to shed.\n\nRegistry members readily admit that, contrary to the claims of many diet books, effective weight loss and maintenance are not easy. Most, like me, became successful when they gave up \u201cdieting\u201d and adopted a sensible eating and exercise plan they could stay on comfortably for the rest of their lives.",

    "text": "The North Carolina Museum of Art\n\nTo Give: Despite my many travels, I\u2019m always excited to return home amid the cultural reinvention of the North Carolina Museum of Art\u2019s home city of Raleigh. I would gift an out-of-town friend a package that celebrates its entrepreneurial spirit with a Poole\u2019s cookbook by chef Ashley Christensen, a gift card to the fashionable Raleigh Denim, and a stay at the fabulous Umstead Hotel and Spa in nearby Cary, N.C.\n\nTo Get: I need a tech inventor to step up for this one. I would like to have a left-brain stimulator, perhaps as goggles or a headset, that could be worn at art museums or exhibitions. It would open up hidden meaning, fantasy, harmony of the illogical, and fascinating personal revelations. To see the world as an irrational, but beautiful, place is a miraculous thing.\n\nMark Hudson Executive director Tudor Place Historic House and Garden\n\nTo Get: I am hoping to receive the hottest ticket in town \u2014 not \u201cHamilton,\u201d but the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Since its opening in September, the museum has been standing-room-only, expressing to me how vital it is to tell the story of the African American experience in a thoughtful, compelling and inspiring way. Like the thousands who have visited in the museum\u2019s first 10 weeks, I seek to have the museum\u2019s exhibitions instill a greater understanding of how all of our lives are interwoven, and how the human spirit can transform adversity into triumph. As a museum director, this experience will serve as my daily affirmation of the power of museums as our griots, bringing people together around our shared heritage. But if \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets come my way, I will certainly take them as well!\n\nTo Give: Likewise, I have the joy of giving the gift of history this holiday season. By sharing the stories of the past, we help people understand how our lives are shaped by history and provide real connections to those who have preceded us. It is a joyful experience to introduce people to new ideas from the past. This year, I am doing so by giving copies of the new book, \u201cTudor Place: America\u2019s Story Lives Here\u201d to my family and friends. I hope I have not ruined any Christmas morning surprises by saying so.\n\nSmithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History\n\nTo Give: I\u2019ve always been a sucker for beautiful fossils, (so) I like to give ammonites. They are the remains of animals that went extinct 66 million years ago. They are like sculptures from the past; they have this gorgeous symmetry and come in various sizes. Look at them and you see a world there that is kind of endless. They\u2019re like little tweets from the past, telling you about worlds that are gone.\n\n[Ammonites can be purchased, but Johnson prefers to find his own. Casual collectors searching on federal land are legally allowed to keep those they find, he said.]\n\nThey are relatively common, but hard enough to find that they are prized as well. I think it\u2019s important for people to have fossils in their houses, to have a little rock that used to be a living thing 150 million years. That\u2019s fun.\n\nTo Get: Most museum curators are object people. We live in a stuff world. As a museum director, I have the responsibility for a collection of 145 million objects. I know what happens when you have the nation\u2019s largest whale collection. Because I oversee the nation\u2019s collection, I have stopped making my own collection. I really treasure people, so my ideal gift is time with my close friends.\n\nfounder, conductor and artistic director\n\nTo Give: Brown would like to give his father, who is himself a pianist and conductor, a CD of Mahler songs recorded by the German baritone Christian Gerhaher. \u201cDas Lied von der Erde,\u201d Mahler\u2019s symphonic song cycle, was \u201cthe last piece I played in [my father\u2019s] orchestra before I went to college,\u201d Brown says. \u201cI have strong memories of it, which were brought back at [Gerhaher\u2019s] Vocal Arts recital\u201d earlier this month. He adds that his gift, personal though it is, has wider appeal. \u201cThough my father loves this rep, it would be good for anyone, even if they think they don\u2019t know, love or understand German very well \u2014 Gerhaher\u2019s diction will likely change their minds!\u201d\n\nTo Get: Brown\u2019s own personal wish list focuses on the neglected operatic repertoire he is spending his career unearthing and recording \u2014 especially, this coming year, two operas on the same subject called \u201cLeonore,\u201d one by Pierre Gaveaux and one by Ludwig van Beethoven that was the first version of what became better known as \u201cFidelio.\u201d Brown\u2019s company is performing both versions in Washington and New York in 2017, starting with the Gaveaux in February; his wish, he says, \u201cwould be for someone to find Gaveaux\u2019s second \u2018Leonore\u2019 aria \u2014 it\u2019s in the libretto but not Gaveaux\u2019s score.\u201d Failing that, Brown has a simpler request to help him prepare for his \u201cLeonore\u201d staging rehearsals, which will be held in January \u2014 in Montreal. \u201cI\u2019d like to receive a Kanuk coat,\u201d he says, referring to the warm garments made by the Canadian manufacturer \u2014 \u201csome pretty fancy but effective winter wear!\u201d\n\nartistic director and Former ballerina\n\nTo Give: My husband, Victor Barbee [associate artistic director of Washington Ballet], and I both find a lot of comfort at Arlington National Cemetery. Both my dad and Victor\u2019s dad are buried there, right around the corner from each other. It\u2019s such a historic and meditative place. The Changing of the Guard ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns is so moving \u2014 there\u2019s that divinity-in-dance theme, in the way they perform all those movements with such sobriety and respect. It\u2019s devotional, and very, very beautiful. So I\u2019d like to give our two children books about the history, ceremonies and design of the final resting place of their grandfathers, such as Rick Atkinson\u2019s \u201cWhere Valor Rests: Arlington National Cemetery\u201d and Robert M. Poole\u2019s \u201cOn Hallowed Ground: The Story of Arlington National Cemetery.\u201d\n\nTo Get: I\u2019m putting my office together here at the Washington Ballet, and at Capitol Consignment in Bethesda, my mom found a set of matching plush chairs \u2014 a local find that I\u2019m seriously contemplating. They\u2019re swivel chairs, in aqua blue, and a bit kitschy; probably from the 1950s or so. I want an eclectic feel, and in an office where I have mostly vintage black furniture, that pop of blue is kind of fun.",

So, Griffin, shop owner Alex Fuller and Fuller's wife got started collecting books.\n\nThe Fuller Cut believes in empowering children \u2013 and since the barbershop is in a predominantly black neighborhood, they mostly stock books that positively portray African American characters.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is get kids reading more.

It\u2019s not just for us, but just to spread the word that reading is very important,\" he told Mashable.\n\n\"And especially in our barbershop, because we're mostly an African American-based barbershop, even though we cut everybody\u2019s hair, we just wanted to have a chance to present that positive image and see that there\u2019s more out there, and with the books that they read, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to enlighten a bit.\u201d\n\nHere are some more adorable photos of The Fuller Cut's customers reading.",

    "text": "This post is in partnership with the History News Network, the website that puts the news into historical perspective. The article below was originally published at HNN.\n\nAt 8am on July 3, 1815, a modest yellow carriage trundled into the port of Rochefort on the French Atlantic coast. It turned into the courtyard of the Marine Prefecture, and a small, stout man in a green overcoat climbed out. It was Napoleon Bonaparte, exhausted after four days on the road from Paris. Eleven days before, he had abdicated for the second time, following his final defeat at Waterloo. He spent his last fortnight in France in the port, pondering how best to save his career, and possibly his life.\n\nNapoleon\u2019s two weeks at Rochefort are generally forgotten, sandwiched as they are between the last two great events of his life \u2013 Waterloo and his departure for St Helena. The received opinion is that one was the inevitable consequence of the other. In fact, this is not the case. After the collapse of his last bid for power in France, there were several courses open to Napoleon, and the most logical one was escape to the USA. His intention in making for Rochefort in the first place was to take ship there across the Atlantic, and he very nearly did. Had he reached America, his own history, and conceivably that of the world, might have turned out very differently.\n\nWhat made flight to the USA such an attractive option for Napoleon? First of all, it was one of the few places left in the world where he could live as a free man. All the European powers had declared him an outlaw. If they captured him, his fate would be very uncertain. He might be allowed to depart to a neutral country, or be placed instead under some form of house arrest; at worst, he might be executed. The USA, on the other hand, had never been his enemy; on the contrary, it had recently been at war with his own greatest opponent, Britain. On a deeper, ideological, level, it made sense as Napoleon\u2019s destination. It was a new country, born of a revolution that had helped inspire the French Revolution of which Napoleon himself was the heir. The symbolism of the greatest adversary of Europe\u2019s old order seeking refuge in the New World would have been unmissable.\n\nThe USA also offered Napoleon new opportunities as well as safety from danger. On its southern border lay the vast territories of Central and South America, currently in the throes of revolution against Spain, and a tempting field of action for an unemployed military genius. Significantly, Napoleon spent much of his last days in Paris before leaving for Rochefort reading the explorer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt\u2019s Voyage to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent, with its detailed descriptions of Mexico, Venezuela and Peru. Napoleon spoke of travelling there simply as a private citizen pursuing scientific research, but his listeners suspected otherwise; the banker Jacques Laffitte, whom he asked to arrange the journey, urged him to make himself Emperor of Mexico.\n\nThese speculations, however, lost Napoleon valuable time. The British government had already established a naval blockade of the French Atlantic ports, and when Napoleon arrived in Rochefort, he found the 74-gun HMS Bellerophon stationed outside the harbour. This made his position more difficult, but by no means hopeless. The French provisional government that had succeeded him had promised to request passports from the British for him and his suite to enable an open departure. If these were refused, he could still make a clandestine escape, hidden on a boat that could slip past the British ships.\n\nOn 4th July, appropriately, Napoleon convened a naval council in Rochefort to decide how best to reach the USA. It concluded that the blockade could not be broken by force, but could be eluded by stealth. Yet instead of making a bold decision, as he would have done just a few years before, Napoleon dithered for six days. Why was this? Probably because he dreaded the humiliation of being captured. He had a point. One of the escape plans involved hiding him in a large brandy-cask; discovery in this inglorious position would have held him up to ridicule. So Napoleon hung on in the increasingly illusory hope of passports and a dignified departure, while all the time the net closed around him.\n\nThis state of limbo ended on July 9, when a letter arrived from the provisional government ordering Napoleon to leave France within 24 hours. Napoleon was now forced to take action. With no word of passports from Paris, he sent a deputation to the Bellerophon hoping that they had been delivered directly there. The ship\u2019s commander, Captain Maitland, had no passports, and made it clear that if Napoleon gave himself up, he would be taken directly to England.\n\nThe alternatives were now stark: unconditional surrender or a secret escape. At the eleventh hour, Napoleon opted for flight. A scheme was devised: on the night of July 13-14 he and a few companions would board a lugger that would sail close to the coast, beyond the reach of the Bellerophon, to a merchant ship anchored off La Rochelle, which would then take him to America. Meanwhile, Napoleon\u2019s elder brother Joseph, the ex-King of Spain, who had arrived a few days before in Rochefort and who resembled him closely, would impersonate him to throw pursuers off the scent.\n\nThen, at midnight on July 13, just as he was about to set off, Napoleon changed his mind. Why he did so will always remain mysterious. He may have had scruples about leaving his entourage behind to an uncertain fate, or his fear of capture may have resurfaced. He may simply have been exhausted and unable to go any further. Whatever the cause, he called off the plan. At 10am on July 15 he surrendered instead to Maitland, hoping he would be granted a place of retirement in England. He was not; three months later, he was on St Helena.\n\nNapoleon\u2019s attempt to reach the USA is one of the great \u2018what ifs\u2019 of history. The secret escape he abandoned on July 13-14 was entirely feasible; his brother Joseph embarked clandestinely at a nearby port ten days later, got to America with no difficulty, and lived comfortably in New Jersey for fifteen years. Had Napoleon followed Joseph\u2019s example, he too might have opted for a tranquil retirement \u2013 or not. In an early essay in counterfactual history, published in 1931 and entitled \u201cIf Napoleon had escaped to America,\u201d the eminent British historian HAL Fisher depicted Napoleon disembarking in New York, then going on to liberate South America before drowning at sea on a final expedition to conquer India. This may seem fanciful, but with Napoleon the fantastic had a habit of becoming reality.\n\nMunro Price is Professor of Modern European History at Bradford University. His books include \u201cThe Perilous Crown: France between Revolutions\u201d; \u201cThe Fall of the French Monarchy\u201d; and \u201cPreserving The Monarchy: The Comte de Vergennes, 1774-1787.\u201d His latest book is \u201cNapoleon: The End of Glory.\u201d",

Cramer has seen plenty of speculation from investors that suggests that all it needs is an activist to turn it around. Is that really the answer?\n\nCurrently, there is no strong leadership at Twitter, and the interim CEO is trying to do everything all at once. He is ridiculously trying to chauffeur his other company, Square, through the IPO process while trying to find a new CEO for Twitter.\n\n\"Given that absurd situation, I think Twitter could be an obvious target for activism,\" Cramer said.\n\nWhile the logical acquirers of Twitter, such as Google and Yahoo, could still make a move on the company, Cramer doesn't think that will happen without an invitation to make a bid. That invite is something that activism could easily provide.\n\nSo, it might make perfect sense for an activist to step in on Twitter, Cramer doesn't think that will happen because it's not a win-win situation. And that's not something Twitter can provide right now.\n\nRead More Cramer: Why activists wouldn't dare touch Twitter\n\nCramer also noticed Radius Health on a tear lately. This is a development stage biotech that has been on fire because of some strong data last week. Radius develops drugs for osteoporosis and other endocrine-mediated disorders.\n\nAnd while the stock more than tripled in value in 2014, it was crushed with an industry-wide selloff this year. However, it looks like Radius is back in the game after it announced that its main osteoporosis drug showed in trial that it works better than the current standard of care, which is a $1.2 billion drug.\n\nCan Radius fly even higher? To find out, Cramer spoke with its CEO Robert Ward.\n\n\"All of us when we saw this latest round of data took a step back and said wow this is really impressive,\" Ward said.\n\nIn the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks:\n\nOpko Health: \"Opko made an acquisition, Bio-Reference Labs, and everyone is freaking out saying it's no good.

    "text": "Andrew H. Madoff, who reported to authorities that his father and longtime Wall Street colleague, Bernard L. Madoff, had masterminded perhaps the largest Ponzi scheme in history, a multi-billion-dollar crime that Andrew described as a \u201cfather-son betrayal of biblical proportions,\u201d died Sept. 3 at a hospital in New York City. He was 48.\n\nHis lawyer, Martin Flumenbaum, said in a statement that the cause was mantle cell lymphoma. Mr. Madoff was diagnosed in 2003 with lymphoma and suffered a relapse a decade later.\n\nMr. Madoff was the only surviving child of \u201cBernie\u201d Madoff, a once-revered financier who is now serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison for felonies including securities fraud and money laundering, and the former Ruth Alpern.\n\nTheir elder son, Mark Madoff, hanged himself on Dec. 11, 2010, exactly two years after Bernard Madoff\u2019s arrest. Mark and Andrew had turned their father in to officials after a tearful confession in which he revealed that his business was \u201call just one big lie.\u201d\n\nLike Mark, Andrew Madoff spent nearly his entire career at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, a family-run powerhouse headquartered in Manhattan\u2019s Lipstick building. Both sons rose to top executive ranks but steadfastly denied involvement in the scheme that their father conducted \u2014 with an unresolved degree of assistance \u2014 alongside the legitimate trading business.\n\nBernard Madoff\u2019s clients included filmmaker Steven Spielberg, Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, retirees and other private investors, and banks, universities and charities.\n\nBernard Madoff took their money and, for years, reported returns that were gainful, reliable and fake. The scheme collapsed amid the financial crisis of 2008, when his clients began requesting the withdrawal of funds that he could not provide. By the end, he had taken an estimated $20 billion in principal investments.\n\nAndrew Madoff publicly repudiated his father after the revelations. Despite his efforts to distance himself from Bernard\u2019s actions, he became entangled in their consequences.\n\nAndrew Madoff was not criminally charged but was the target of civil lawsuits by Irving H. Picard, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the liquidation of the Madoff firm and the compensation of victims. In July 2014, amending earlier claims, Picard filed documents seeking the recovery of $153 million that Andrew and Mark Madoff had allegedly received through improper loans and other means.\n\nThe suit charged that the brothers had known of their father\u2019s fraud and that they had deleted or altered records during an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A lawyer for Andrew and his late brother\u2019s estate described the allegations as \u201cunfounded.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that when people have heard my story,\u201d Andrew Madoff told the New York Times in 2011, \u201cthey will judge me a little bit less harshly.\u201d\n\nAndrew had gone to work for his father in the late 1980s, shortly after graduating from college. He was \u201ccerebral\u201d and \u201ctech-savvy,\u201daccording to Vanity Fair, while Mark Madoff was more \u201cgregarious.\u201d Together the brothers helped oversee the firm\u2019s trading enterprise.\n\nBernie Madoff, it has been widely reported, ran his secretive and fraudulent hedge fund in a secluded office on another floor. He maintained that the fraud began in 1992, but other accounts placed its start date earlier.\n\nAs the U.S. economy crumbled in 2008, Bernard Madoff appeared to be under increasing stress. On Dec. 10, he asked his sons to accompany him to his Manhattan apartment, where he revealed that the business was a fraud and that he had no money.\n\n\u201cHe just started sobbing,\u201d Andrew Madoff told journalist Morley Safer of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2011. \u201cI was shocked. . . . I felt like my head exploded.\u201d\n\nAndrew said that his brother \u201cstormed out\u201d and that he then followed. They called upon a lawyer and, within hours, reported their father to authorities. The next morning, Bernard Madoff was arrested at his Manhattan home. Andrew refused to co-sign for the bail bond.\n\nAs the extent of their father\u2019s fraud was revealed \u2014 $65 billion in reported paper wealth \u2014 public outrage mounted, including at his associates. As Bernard Madoff\u2019s sons, Mark and Andrew remained the subjects of particular suspicion.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind, these were completely separate businesses,\u201d Andrew Madoff told Safer, referring to the division between the real and fraudulent operations at the investment firm. \u201cWe were executing hundreds of thousands of transactions a day. And that kept all of us incredibly busy. And it just didn\u2019t occur to me that he could be involved in any kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nAndrew Madoff further contended that his father used the work of the company\u2019s actual traders to maintain the aura of expertise that helped attract and maintain clients for the scheme. \u201cIt was one of the hardest things to come to grips with,\u201d he told Safer, \u201cthat feeling that I had been used almost as a . . . human shield by him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable,\u201d he continued. \u201cNo father should do that to their sons.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, a judge in England dismissed a case against Mark and Andrew Madoff, ruling that they neither \u201cknew of, or suspected, the fraud\u201d and that \u201ctheir honesty and integrity has been vindicated.\u201d\n\nDiana B. Henriques, a reporter who covered the Madoff case for the New York Times, noted in her 2011 book about the story, \u201cThe Wizard of Lies,\u201d that if the sons were guilty, they might have fled \u2014 and that they had not.\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning of this whole episode,\u201d Andrew Madoff told Safer, \u201cI\u2019ve been eager, I would say almost desperate, to speak out publicly and tell people that I\u2019m absolutely not involved.\u201d\n\nAndrew Howard Madoff was born April 8, 1966, and grew up in the Long Island community of Roslyn. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton business school in 1988. By the mid-1990s, he was running the Nasdaq desk at his father\u2019s securities firm.\n\n\u201cThey were a very hardworking family,\u201d one trader told Erin Arvedlund, a financial journalist and the author of the 2009 book \u201cToo Good to Be True: The Rise and Fall of Bernie Madoff.\u201d \u201cAndrew didn\u2019t take a vacation for about four years after he started.\u201d\n\nAt times, he sought independence from his father. He invested in businesses including Urban Angler, a fly shop in Manhattan; Abel Automatics, a California-based producer of fishing tools; and Madoff Energy, an energy-exploration venture.\n\nAfter Bernard\u2019s confession, the Madoff family fell apart. Andrew was separated from his first wife, the former Deborah West, before she filed for divorce on the day of her father-in-law\u2019s arrest. They had two daughters, Anne and Emily.\n\nAndrew said that for two years he rarely spoke to his mother, whom he blamed for appearing to stand by Bernard. He said that they restored contact after Mark\u2019s suicide.\n\nMr. Madoff met Catherine Hooper, a onetime cover girl for Fish & Fly magazine, through the Urban Angler shop, where she also was an investor. With Hooper, he operated Black Umbrella, a provider of emergency preparedness services that she had founded. They reportedly were engaged.\n\nA complete list of survivors could not immediately be confirmed.\n\nUnlike other members of the family, Andrew Madoff did not move to change his name.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who I am,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name is Madoff, and I\u2019ll live with that for the rest of my life.\u201d",

It is the second Classic for both these teams with the Capitals having won at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, 3-1 in 2011, while the Blackhawks dropped a high-scoring 6-4 decision in 2009 against the Detroit Red Wings at Chicago's Wrigley Field. The win must have been blowing out that day.\n\nOn mobile? See tweet here\n\nHow popular are these outdoor matches? Popular enough to be broadcast in 160 countries led by national broadcasts on CBC, NBC and TVA in North America. Since 1975 five of the six most-watched regular season games in the NHL have been Winter Classics.\n\nEach team comes into the game playing well. Chicago is 7-2-1 in their last 10 and posted a 10-2-1 mark for the month of December. They topped Nashville, 5-4 in a shootout in their last outing Monday.\n\nThe Capitals are 6-1-3 in their last 10, including a 4-3 overtime loss to the Islanders on Monday.\n\nOn mobile? View tweet here\n\nLots to look forward to in this one. It promises to be the second warmest NHL Winter Classic with temperatures in the low to mid 40's Farenheit, around 5-7 Celsius. Only the 2011 Winter Classic which reached 51 F, 10.5 C, was warmer.\n\nThe biggest question mark is will the sun affect the start time of the game.

Tuesday, they won 3-1 at San Jose with Radim Vrbata supplying the goal that put it out of reach.\n\nCanucks' penalty-killers did a great job in December, killing off 34 of 36 penalties, including shutting down the potent Sharks.\n\nThe Kings are 0-for-2-for-Canada on a road trip, losing to both Calgary and Edmonton. That's five straight road losses for L.A. as they have only four road wins the entire season. Only Edmonton has fewer road wins.\n\nL.A. forced Tuesday's game in Edmonton to a shootout before losing 3-2. James Quick was beaten by David Perron to decide that one.\n\nQuick, however, is 4-1 vs. Vancouver in his last five starts, including a 5-1 win Nov. 8.",

In the last few days, as they came under attack, liberal bloggers have mounted campaigns to persuade Mr. Edwards to keep them on. [Update: Read John Broder\u2019s overview of the controversy, online now and in tomorrow\u2019s print edition.]\n\nThe tone and the sentiment of some of Amanda Marcotte\u2019s and Melissa McEwen\u2019s posts personally offended me. It\u2019s not how I talk to people, and it\u2019s not how I expect the people who work for me to talk to people. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but that kind of intolerant language will not be permitted from anyone on my campaign, whether it\u2019s intended as satire, humor, or anything else.\n\nBut I also believe in giving everyone a fair shake. I\u2019ve talked to Amanda and Melissa; they have both assured me that it was never their intention to malign anyone\u2019s faith, and I take them at their word. We\u2019re beginning a great debate about the future of our country, and we can\u2019t let it be hijacked.

    "text": "Updated Dec 31, 2012 8:56 AM ET\n\nThe transfer window opens on New Year's Day, allowing Barclays Premier League sides one last chance to tinker with their squads for the rest of the 2012-13 season.\n\n10 reasons why clubs dream of striking rich during transfer season.\n\nHere, the potential arrivals and departures at each of the 20 clubs in the top flight are assessed.\n\nManager Arsene Wenger is looking to strengthen across the board to breathe fresh life into Arsenal's push for a top four finish. A striker tops Wenger's shopping list, with David Villa a possible target.\n\nMarouane Chamakh, Andrey Arshavin, Andre Santos, Johan Djourou, Sebastien Squillaci.\n\nAston Villa manager Paul Lambert spent \u00a323million during the summer, placed his trust in youth and fielded the youngest ever Premier League side this season with an average age of less than 24. Manchester City's 20-year-old striker John Guidetti is a possible loan target while Dnipro's \u00a32million-rated midfielder Derek Boateng is also on Lambert's radar.\n\nInterim manager Rafael Benitez has all but confirmed Chelsea are trying to sign a new striker but it remains to be seen whether they will spend big on the likes of Radamel Falcao or look for a cut-price alternative, such as Demba Ba, David Villa or Alvaro Negredo. A new midfielder could also arrive.\n\nDaniel Sturridge, Florent Malouda, Yossi Benayoun.\n\nFinancial constraints mean David Moyes does not expect to be busy in the window but he would ideally like to add some more firepower if he can and has been looking at Paris St Germain striker Kevin Gameiro.\n\nThe departures of Mousa Dembele and Clint Dempsey late in the summer window have left Fulham light, meaning a central midfielder and centre-back are vital additions.\n\nPajtim Kasami, Brede Hangeland, David Stockdale, Csaba Somogyi and Mickael Tavares.\n\nManager Brendan Rodgers has admitted he does not have much to spend in January and a deal for Chelsea forward Daniel Sturridge, which is virtually done, will take up the vast chunk of his budget. Blackpool winger Tom Ince is the other signing the club are hopeful of wrapping up early on while Rodgers continues to be linked with Birmingham's Jack Butland despite saying he would not be signing a goalkeeper in January.\n\nJoe Cole, Stewart Downing, Jordan Henderson, Sebastian Coates.\n\nRoberto Mancini has repeatedly played down speculation he could dip into the market but it will not go away and there is a feeling fresh blood could add impetus to City's title challenge, although some high earners might have to be moved on first.\n\nMario Balotelli, Edin Dzeko, Kolo Toure, Joleon Lescott.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson says he is happy with his squad and January is not a time when he does a lot of business. But don't discount a new signing, even if the actual player does not arrive until the summer.\n\nAlan Pardew knows he needs at least one, if not two or three additions to a squad ravaged by injuries during the opening half of the campaign with Marseille striker Loic Remy, Lille full-back Mathieu Debuchy and FC Twente defender Douglas among his major targets, although much will depend on whether or not Demba Ba remains on the books at the end of January.\n\nDemba Ba, Xisco, Nile Ranger.\n\nNorwich could look to add another striker to their squad as they have managed only 20 goals so far in the league. A move for a goalkeeper is a possibility with England international John Ruddy sidelined following a groin operation.\n\nElliott Ward, Marc Tierney, Simon Lappin, Steve Morison.\n\nWhere do we start? QPR's miserable season is due in no small part to their completely unbalanced squad. Nicolas Anelka is being targeted to fill the large void in attack, while central defence is another area requiring improvements.\n\nJose Bosingwa, Esteban Granero, Hogan Ephraim, Rob Hulse, Jay Bothroyd.\n\nThe realisation at Reading that they failed to strengthen sufficiently during the summer may have come too late. Manager Brian McDermott is looking for two to three players with top-flight experience. Expect Andrey Arshavin to be one of them.\n\nSaints' defence may have improved recently but a centre-back is still a high priority. A new goalkeeper could be a wily addition, while more attacking options would not go amiss with survival in mind.\n\nDanny Fox, Tadanari Lee, Danny Butterfield, Steve de Ridder, Sam Hoskins, Ryan Dickson and Jonathan Forte.\n\nBoss Tony Pulis has made it clear he has no intention of letting any of his key players - such as skipper Ryan Shawcross or goalkeeper Asmir Begovic - leave in January, while indicating he will be looking to \"bring one or two in\".\n\nWilson Palacios, Cameron Jerome, Rory Delap.\n\nMartin O'Neill has made no secret of his desire to strengthen further in January. Striking a permanent deal for on-loan Tottenham full-back Danny Rose could be a focus, and he has also been linked with a move for Genoa defender Andreas Granqvist, while extra physicality in central midfield is something he feels he needs to add.\n\nTitus Bramble, Matthew Kilgallon, Fraizer Campbell, Ji Dong-won.\n\nSwansea manager Michael Laudrup is keen to bring in a striker to allow top scorer Michu to return to his favoured attacking midfielder role. Celta Vigo's Iago Aspas and Sporting Braga's Ederzito Lopes are thought to be at the top of the Dane's wishlist.\n\nDanny Graham, Luke Moore, Mark Gower, Leroy Lita, Jazz Richards, Alan Tate.\n\nManager Andre Villas-Boas says he will not be active in the transfer market, but he only has two recognised strikers and could therefore make a move for Shakhtar Donetsk forward Willian, Athletic Bilbao's Fernando Llorente or Loic Remy of Marseille.\n\nCarlo Cudicini, Heurelho Gomes, David Bentley, Jermaine Jenas, Danny Rose, Tom Huddlestone.\n\nBaggies boss Steve Clarke has constantly made it clear he is happy with the squad at his disposal for the remainder of the season after climbing into the top six of the Barclays Premier League and any additions are likely to be only loanees.\n\nGet the latest rumors as the biggest clubs try to bolster their rosters.\n\nManager Sam Allardyce has already been linked with big-name players such as David Beckham and Nicolas Anelka but knows the club's wage structure could scupper such deals. A loan move for an attacking player could go ahead following Yossi Benayoun's return to parent club Chelsea.\n\nThe January transfer window is a welcome arrival for Wigan boss Roberto Martinez, who has been contending with an injury crisis. Midfielder Roger Espinoza's transfer from Sporting Kansas City has already been completed while a loan deal for Manchester United striker Angelo Henriquez is almost a done deal. The Latics have also been linked with former Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou, now at Lille, and Manchester City midfielder Abdisalam Ibrahim.",

Self-coached, he trains about 55 miles from his home in a remote village. He prepared for New York with Wilson Kipsang, who set the official world record, 2:03:23, in Berlin in September, and Dennis Kimetto, who set the course record in Chicago in October.\n\nThe eldest of 11 children, Mutai ran 2:03:02 in Boston in 2011, but the time was not recognized as a world record because of the configuration of the course and a tailwind.\n\nOn Sunday, he reasserted himself as the man to beat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a glory\u00e2\u0080\u009d to win, said Mutai, who called Kimetto and Kipsang his colleagues, not his rivals. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m more famous now in Kenya.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarathons are filled with plenty of subplots, and this men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s race included a chase for $500,000.\n\nEntering Sunday, Kebede led in the World Marathon Majors standings and stood to win that jackpot if he finished ahead of Stephen Kiprotich, who was in third place.\n\nBut Kiprotich, a Ugandan who won the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics and this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world championships, a rare double, was never far behind in what was a tactical early race.\n\nFor the first half, Kebede and Kiprotich jostled for position in a pack of runners. As they crossed the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan, a group of nine sprinted ahead and set the stage for a battle up First Avenue.\n\nMutai was among them, occasionally surging ahead and breaking to the side. Kebede and Kiprotich hung tight in the pack, as no runner seemed to want to push the pace alone.\n\nAs the pack turned around in the Bronx and ran down Fifth Avenue, the field thinned further, and Mutai and Biwott pulled ahead with a vengeance. April and Kebede gave chase, but they faded around Mile 21.\n\nAfter the race, Kebede said he had a problem with a calf muscle. No doubt eager to claim the $500,000 prize, though, he stormed back to finish firmly in second place. He twirled his cap in celebration as he neared the finish line and crossed it 52 seconds behind Mutai. Kiprotich faded, finishing 12th.\n\nRyan Vail, who trains in Oregon and was supposed to have run in New York last year, was the top American man, finishing 13th in 2:13:23. Meb Keflezighi, who led for parts of the race, finished 20th.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can feel the energy here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vail said of the crowds.",

Defense Secretary Robert Gates, attempting a bold reshaping of the military-industrial complex to meet the changing nature of war, pleaded with the lawmakers to rise above the powerful contractors that fund their campaigns and influence their elections. \"The responsibility of this department first and foremost is to fight and win the nation's wars,\" Gates reminded them. \"I know that some will take issue with individual decisions. I would ask, however, that you look beyond specific programs and instead at the full range of what we are trying to do.\"\n\nNot likely, Mr. Secretary. Lawmakers are perfectly happy to reform military procurement, as long as the cuts are not made in any of their back yards. The result will inevitably be that the Pentagon is forced to fund many programs it doesn't want while shortchanging others it urgently needs.\n\nYesterday brought two of these NIMBY hearings to the Capitol complex. First, the House Appropriations defense subcommittee huddled with the secretary of the Army, Pete Geren, and the Army chief of staff, Gen. George Casey. Chairman Jack Murtha (D-Pa.), who has a solid reputation for giving the Pentagon things it doesn't need, was once more concerned that the war fighters didn't ask for more. \"You only put $2 billion into the budget,\" he complained about one project. \"I assume you'll ask for more money?\"",

    "text": "INA, Japan\u2014 Toyota Motor Corp. TM -1.98 % \u2019s production methods have been studied the world over, inspiring dozens of books about management and manufacturing.\n\nSo where does Toyota go when it needs management advice? To this mountain town, where a little company called Ina Food Industry Co. makes a living turning seaweed into a gelatin-like substance called agar.\n\nA squishy staple of Japan\u2019s cuisine for four centuries that can be found as a vegetarian substitute for gelatin in the U.S., agar can be pressed into noodles or mixed with beans and sugar to make a sweet confection. For non-Japanese, it takes some getting used to, and so does the management philosophy of Ina Food\u2019s chief executive-guru, who is followed by many of Japan\u2019s most powerful leaders despite his anonymity abroad.\n\nThe agar man, Hiroshi Tsukakoshi, 77 years old, preaches wariness of American management methods, which he says are warped by short-term thinking. He says companies should exist to make their workers happy, and says employees should clean the office toilets to foster a sense of responsibility.\n\nToyota executives and other Japanese economic and business leaders, such as Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda, have been trekking to Ina Food\u2019s headquarters to glean insights on a record of consistency that even mighty Toyota can\u2019t match: At one point, the company recorded 48 consecutive years of profit growth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the size of the company really matters when it comes to learning about corporate management,\u201d says Toyota boss Akio Toyoda. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much from Mr. Tsukakoshi and his philosophy that steady growth is essential for any company.\u201d\n\nMr. Toyoda\u2019s reverence for the agar maker helps explain the stickiness of traditional business values in Japan, where long-term success and social cohesion are often favored over short-term profitability.\n\nShareholder returns in Japan have trailed levels in the U.S. and other Western markets. Foreign investors, who hold a record level of Japanese shares, are pushing companies to return more profits to investors. They have an ally in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wants companies to adopt international norms.\n\nMr. Tsukakoshi offers a riposte, in a book titled \u201cTree-Ring Management\u201d\u2014so-called because a tree steadily adds one ring a year, rather than expanding and contracting erratically. \u201cTrees keep growing even when the weather is bad,\u201d Mr. Tsukakoshi writes. \u201cCompanies should be like that, too. You have to keep growing little by little, even if the pace is slow.\u201d\n\nToyota executives don\u2019t have to clean their own bathrooms, but Mr. Toyoda requires managers to read \u201cTree-Ring Management.\u201d\n\nThough the car maker is raking in record profits, Mr. Toyoda says he wants to attract long-term investors rather than those who are focused on short-term gains. In July, the company issued a new kind of shares that lock holders into ownership for at least five years. The plan drew opposition from some foreign investors, who collectively hold around a 30% stake in Toyota.\n\nWith $140 million in annual sales, privately held Ina Food is only a tiny fraction the size of Toyota, whose revenue tops $200 billion. But it makes roughly 80% of the approximately 2,300 tons of agar and related products that circulate annually in Japan, according to Mr. Tsukakoshi, who says he owes his own longevity to a daily intake of the stuff.\n\nIna Food\u2019s 24-acre headquarters here is a monument to Mr. Tsukakoshi\u2019s steady-as-it-goes philosophy. The complex houses an agar research and development center, an agar exhibition, an agar factory, two agar shops and two agar restaurants.\n\nOn a sunny afternoon in July, tourists were relaxing in the Kanten Papa Garden\u2014named after the company\u2019s best-known brand of kanten, as agar is known in Japanese. Hydrangeas, cared for by Ina Food employees every morning, were blooming, and a monument with a metal plate displayed the corporate motto: \u201cLet\u2019s make a good company.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou spend a large part of your life working,\u201d Mr. Tsukakoshi said in an interview. \u201cIsn\u2019t there something wrong if companies are producing unhappy people?\u201d\n\nTo maintain harmony among Ina Food\u2019s 500 or so employees, he said, the company will stick to its seniority-based lifetime employment system. Some other Japanese companies\u2014including Toyota, with 344,000 workers globally\u2014have begun experimenting with ways to reward merit, rather than experience, though rung-by-rung ladder-climbing remains the norm.\n\nMr. Tsukakoshi\u2019s aversion to rapid growth was reinforced by the Great Agar Bubble of 2005. After a television show highlighted the health benefits of agar, which is low in calories and rich in fiber, Ina Food had to operate its factories day and night to keep up with demand. Annual revenue jumped 40%.\n\nSome CEOs might have pocketed their bonuses and rejoiced, but not Mr. Tsukakoshi, who fretted about what would happen next. Sure enough, in 2006, sales plunged.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most important is not to pursue short-term greed and efficiency,\u201d Mr. Tsukakoshi said.\n\nOther companies may talk about social responsibility, but Ina Food offers free agar at the annual Kanten Papa festival in Ina, served as tokoroten, a clear, cold noodle dish dipped in sauce, or as anmitsu, a dessert with agar-based jelly, sweet red bean sauce and fruits. There\u2019s a Kanten Papa children\u2019s music competition and a Kanten Papa children\u2019s drawing contest. Toyota has a similar contest.\n\nMr. Toyoda, who is 59, first met the Ina Food chief about five years ago, when Mr. Tsukakoshi gave a speech on long-term growth at a Toyota-related event. His words struck a chord with Mr. Toyoda, who was struggling to turn around the car maker from huge losses that followed a period of rapid expansion.\n\nThe two have continued to meet since then. Mr. Toyoda, who says he regularly eats agar, has begun to borrow phrases from Mr. Tsukakoshi\u2019s book in his own speeches.\n\n\u201cWe were like a tree whose rings grew too rapidly at one point, and whose trunk became weak and prone to breaking,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said at an earnings announcement last year. \u201cTo grow sustainably means to build a ring around the tree trunk each year.\u201d\n\nWrite to Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com",

    "text": "In what will be one of the most closely watched unionization elections in the South in decades, Volkswagen announced on Monday that the 1,600 workers at its assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., will vote next week on whether to join the United Automobile Workers.\n\nThe union has voiced unusual optimism about winning because Volkswagen, unlike many United States companies, is not opposing the unionization drive and because U.A.W. organizers say the majority of workers have already signed cards backing a union.\n\nIn announcing the secret-ballot election, which will be held Feb. 12 through Feb. 14, Volkswagen said the U.A.W., if voted in, would work to set up a works council \u2014 a common industry practice in Germany in which managers work with representatives of white- and blue-collar workers to foster collaboration and increase productivity.\n\n\u201cVolkswagen Group of America and the U.A.W. have agreed to this common path for the election,\u201d said Frank Fischer, chairman and chief executive of Volkswagen Chattanooga. \u201cVolkswagen is committed to neutrality and calls upon all third parties to honor the principle of neutrality.\u201d\n\nMany Tennessee lawmakers, including Gov. Bill Haslam and Senator Bob Corker, have voiced concern about the U.A.W.\u2019s drive, warning that the unionization of the plant would make it less competitive and hurt Chattanooga\u2019s and Tennessee\u2019s business climate. But U.A.W. officials and many pro-union workers argue that having a union will make the plant more efficient and productive by increasing labor-management collaboration.\n\n\u201cVolkswagen is known globally for its system of cooperation with unions and works councils,\u201d said Bob King, the union\u2019s president. \u201cThe U.A.W. seeks to partner with Volkswagen Group of America and a works council to set a new standard in the U.S. for innovative labor-management relations that benefits the company, the entire work force, shareholders and the community.\u201d\n\nThe U.A.W. and many labor relations experts say it would be illegal to have a works council at an American company without first having a union voted in, because without one the works council might be considered an improper employer-dominated employee group.\n\nWorks councils traditionally represent employees on a wide range of internal matters at a plant, Volkswagen said, while their union represents the employees on matters relating to terms and conditions like pay, benefits and length of workweek. VW said the detailed distribution of responsibilities between union and works council would be negotiated if the U.A.W. wins next week\u2019s vote.\n\nWilliam L. Canak, a labor relations expert at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, said he expected a surge in anti-U.A.W. activity in Chattanooga over the next week.\n\n\u201cThis effort will inflame many lawmakers and the Chamber of Commerce and other groups that oppose unions and collective bargaining,\u201d Professor Canak said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a strong oppositional response. But if the U.A.W. wins here, it would encourage workers hoping to unionize Nissan in Mississippi, Mercedes-Benz in Alabama and BMW in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nThe U.A.W. had initially hoped that Volkswagen would grant union recognition based on what it said was a majority of pro-union cards signed by the plant\u2019s workers. But Volkswagen faced intense pressure from Senator Corker and others who opposed granting recognition through a so-called card check, asserting that a secret-ballot election would be fairer.\n\nMike Burton, a quality assurance worker who has set up an anti-union website, no2uaw.com, said the woes of Detroit\u2019s automakers and the closing of the plant that Volkswagen had in Pennsylvania pointed to underlying problems with having the U.A.W. at the VW plant in Chattanooga. \u201cThe U.A.W. wouldn\u2019t be the best partner for our company,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Burton questioned the U.A.W.\u2019s optimism, saying that in a two-week period he collected 600 anti-U.A.W. signatures on a petition. Mr. Burton, backed by several outside anti-union groups, protested that Volkswagen was giving the U.A.W. the names and addresses of all of the plant\u2019s workers, but would not give him the names and addresses.\n\nJustin King, another assembly line worker, supports the union. \u201cI feel VW would benefit from having a union,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would give workers a voice in decisions. I think when just a few managers make decisions for thousands of people without input from those people, they don\u2019t always make the best decisions.\u201d\n\nRon Harr, president of the Chattanooga Chamber of Commerce, voiced concern about a union victory. \u201cWe believe the U.A.W. organizing at Volkswagen will make it more difficult for us from an economic development point of view as a community,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the city\u2019s mayor, Andy Berke, did not seem to worry.\n\n\u201cChattanooga has unique assets that allow us to grow economically,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same things that brought VW here \u2014 quality of life, a productive work force, wages that compare favorably to the rest of the country \u2014 those will still exist regardless of what happens with unionization.\u201d",

    "text": "Correction appended Feb. 2, 2016.\n\nAs more than 100 million people around the U.S. and the world gather around their TVs on Feb. 7 for Super Bowl 50, many are tuning in for the ads as much as for the game. And what people are looking for in these much-anticipated and highly coveted commercial slots are mini-movies.\n\nThis year, Ford\u2019s vice president of global marketing said the company will not run a Super Bowl ad because it does not need to boost name recognition. Yet to be a winner in the Super Bowl of Advertising, marketers must develop more than awareness. No matter how large the audience, paying upwards of $5 million for 30 seconds doesn\u2019t make sense unless the ads pay for themselves in other ways, such as online buzz, media coverage and memorability\u2014three things that the power of a good story can deliver.\n\nIf advertisers want to step up their game in the Super Bowl, they would be better served by looking beyond the latest fad, camera trick and celebrity. Instead, they should refer back to the master of storytelling: William Shakespeare.\n\nMy research colleague Michael Coolsen of Shippensburg University and I asked ourselves: what makes a Super Bowl ad super in terms of likability or favorability in Super Bowl Ad ratings polls like USA Today Ad Meter? After analyzing two years\u2019 worth of Super Bowl ads, we found that beyond any other characteristics or technique such as sex appeal, animals, humor or celebrity, telling a full story made the difference between finishing at the top of the polls and landing at the bottom. And this likability or favorability of a commercial can be tied to word-of-mouth buzz, purchase intent, recall and other factors that marketers expect ads to deliver.\n\nHow can a Super Bowl marketer deliver a star performance? Our research revealed that the basis of the top Super Bowl ads was having or following a five-act story structure\u2014the one that Shakespeare used in his popular plays. Our study coded TV ads for following a five-part story based on 19th-century German novelist Gustav Freytag\u2019s pyramid. He noticed common patterns in plots of stories and diagramed them.\n\nThe top spots in our Super Bowl ad analysis had all five acts of Freytag\u2019s Pyramid:\n\nCan an advertiser accomplish all this in a minute or less? Surprisingly our results revealed that a full five-act story could be told as a mini movie.\n\nIf you look back at the Super Bowl ad polls, you will see the top spots have full stories. These are the commercials that are talked about and remembered. Other commercials may get initial attention for being controversial for using sex appeal or celebrity, but then fade away finishing near the bottom of the Super Bowl Ad polls and loosing out on valuable buzz and recall.\n\nFor example, the first place in last year\u2019s 2015 USA Today\u2019s Ad Meter was Budweiser\u2019s \u201cLost Dog\u201d\u2014a commercial with a full five-act story. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the marketer is using a cute puppy, but 60 seconds of a puppy playing with a Budweiser bottle would not have been a hit.\n\nHow is \u201cLost Dog\u201d a mini-movie? Act 1 introduces the farmer, the Clydesdales and a puppy on a farm. Act 2 features the puppy sneaking into the trailer and getting lost. Act 3 shows the puppy making it back home at night only to be threatened by a growling wolf. What will happen? The Clydesdales break out of their stalls and run up the hill to save their puppy friend, leading into Act 4, when the farmer awakes at sunrise to spot the puppy and the Clydesdales running up the farm drive. Act 5 shows the farmer welcoming the puppy home and sitting down with a Budweiser.\n\nIn contrast, T-Mobile\u2019s Kim Kardashian \u201cSave the Data\u201d commercial delivered a single joke based on her celebrity and sex appeal and finished 59th out of 61 spots, just beating out Jublia\u2019s animated toenail fungus spot. \u201cSave the Data\u201d had more than 17 million views, while \u201cLost Dog\u201d had more than 40 million views.\n\nAnother good comparison between an ad that won Ad Meter and one that did not is Always\u2019 \u201cLike A Girl\u201d commercial, which finished second on USA Today\u2019s poll, and GoDaddy\u2019s \u201cWorking\u201d ad, which finished 55th.\n\n\u201cLike A Girl,\u201d a 60-second version of a longer viral video hit that took off the previous fall, also follows a five-step storyline: Act 1 sets the scene as an audition, asking each actor and actress to run, throw and fight like a girl. Act 2 happens as the viewer realizes these characterizations are wrong. Act 3 comes when the actors or actresses realize what they are doing is wrong. Act 4 shows young girls asked the same questions and responding with positive actions. Act 5 is a call to get more people to help change the meaning of the phrase \u201clike a girl.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cWorking\u201d is one long camera shot of a business owner working hard during the Super Bowl while everyone else is at Super Bowl parties. It is a joke with an extended punch line that only has one act\u2014nothing happens to move the story forward.

(Kate Porter/CBC)\n\nThe city currently brings in about $12 million annually in fines from provincial offences, including $3.9 million last year from red-light cameras. Five more cameras will be added this year.\n\nAlso on Jan.1, the fine for the late-payment of provincial tickets, including red-light tickets, went up from $20 to $40.\n\nStephanson doesn't expect the city to receive much more revenue from that, though. The funds will likely go toward offsetting costs of running Provincial Offences Act courts, including costs for justices of the peace, which also went up Jan. 1.",

    "text": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\n\u201cThe love of money is the root of all evils.\u201d The words of St Paul may be a rhetorical exaggeration \u2013 surely lust, pride and gluttony create their fair share of problems \u2013 but the troubles at FIFA show the remarkable damage that the combination of abundant money and weak institutions can cause in today\u2019s affluent societies.\n\nFIFA was totally unprepared for wealth. For the first seven decades of its existence, it was much more of a global club for soccer enthusiasts than a business. As long as the monetary stakes were low, lovers of the beautiful game were the right people to coordinate and promote the sport.\n\nRevenue was just starting to pour in by 1974, when Joao Havelange became FIFA president. The Brazilian may well have been more interested in sport than in money, but the millions of dollars\u2019 worth of fees and bribes he accepted show how far the lure of lucre pulled him from what used to be called good sportsmanship.\n\nIn the subsequent decades, football has become a substantial global business, worth $35 billion in 2013 according to consultants A.T. Kearney. Sponsors and broadcasters pay billions of dollars to be associated with the sport, and players and coaches receive millions for their efforts.\n\nThe people connected with FIFA are key cogs in this cash-spewing machine, but they can take no credit for the main sources of the money. World GDP has more than doubled in the last three decades after adjusting for inflation, by U.S. government calculations. Enough of the new wealth has gone to soccer to allow, for example, a 16-fold real increase in average pay for English top-tier players, as calculated by sportingintelligence.com\n\nIdeally, these employees would recognise that their contributions are modest and technical, and would refuse anything more than appropriately restrained compensation. Dream on. Such restraint requires either a strong institutional tradition of integrity, backed by actively enforced rules, or staff with exceptional moral fortitude. FIFA had neither.\n\nThe appeal of money is hardly limited to professional sports. As St Paul pointed out two millennia ago, the love of money can distract, distort and destroy. Passion, whether pecuniary or romantic, is often more powerful than law, custom or commonsense. And the monetary temptations have probably increased along with global affluence.\n\nConsider drug crime. Ross Ulbricht was just sentenced to life in prison for organising Silk Road, a more efficient way to do illegal business. He seems to have been motivated by libertarian ideology, not greed, but he is the exception. For most growers and dealers, the hope of making a fortune drives them to damage users\u2019 lives while risking prison and death.\n\nBut it is not only potential criminal gains which lead to bad behaviour. The moral drama of the perfectly legal sport of pushing up executive compensation is quite similar to the deadly crimes of Latin American drug cartels and the legal and illegal excesses at FIFA. Corporate bosses and financial traders play pay-leapfrog with each other, aided by complacent boards of directors and supine shareholders. Compensation consultants provide spurious economic justification for what any rational observer would call greed.\n\nThe increasing distance between pay for the business elite and for the rest of the population is unjust, since corporate chiefs are merely senior members of large bureaucracies, not sports stars. The pay gap is probably also bad for the economy, because the desire for higher pay leads bosses to think more about their bank accounts than the good of customers, workers or the community. A moralist would add that the monetary craving is bad for the soul of anyone who is already well supplied with comforts and luxuries.\n\nWhat can be done to counter the dangerous appeal of riches? At FIFA, the replacement of Sepp Blatter, the longstanding president who announced his resignation on June 2, could start a moral and regulatory renewal. The new person will be supported by the increasing global intolerance of tax evasion, bribes and kickbacks. For FIFA officials, the fear of fines, prison and public shame may soon outweigh the appeal of cash.\n\nIt is likely to be harder to restrain the greed of drug dealers and corporate executives. Neither shame nor law have much effect on either group. The former are content to be criminals and can often pay for immunity from prosecution. The latter generally see no evil in their desire for ever larger rewards, and the consultants ensure that their packages are not only legal but respectable.\n\nCampaigners against excessive pay should take note of St Paul\u2019s precise words. He did not criticise money, but the love of it. Institutions will only be strengthened when the ardour for gain is restrained by some stronger force. Laws are important, but the battle must ultimately be fought in the turbulent fields of love, people\u2019s hearts and minds.",
    "summary": "The soccer federation\u2019s corruption shows how much harm abundant money can do to weak institutions. The problem goes well beyond sport. Modern affluence spreads lucre\u2019s poison to everything from drug crime to the perfectly legal but socially destructive spiral of executive pay."

    "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters.com) -- Getting product on Wal-Mart's shelves has long been the top goal for consumer product-focused businesses, even if it felt like running a marathon to get there. Yet some say, it's become a little easier as Wal-Mart becomes more accessible.\n\nAccording to the company's own data, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. buys from nearly 61,000 U.S. suppliers, spending some $200 billion on merchandise in 2006 alone.\n\nWal-Mart has a proprietary Web-based system called Retail Link, where suppliers can access critical information on orders they have in process and see how well their products are performing in the retailer's stores.\n\nThere are also sites that offer insight on the company's buying philosophies, such as Check Out , a blog created by some of Wal-Mart's own buyers to discuss in-store trends, as well as their likes and dislikes of products in categories such as electronic gadgets and games. The company also has programs that support supplier diversity, as well a broad commitment to sustainability initiatives unveiled in 2005.\n\nConsultants such as Warady can also make the selling process easier, helping vendors put their best foot forward during that all-important half-hour presentation to buyers at Wal-Mart's Bentonville, Arkansas office.\n\nThere are other partners available, such as fulfillment houses to manage shipping and logistics and ease the burden of Wal-Mart's demands for tight turn-around and strict packaging specifications.\n\nGetting in still requires a track record, tons of preparation and the proven ability to deliver. Wal-Mart will not coddle smaller companies, entrepreneurs say, and one can easily lose a chance at an opening if management is unprepared or misses a deadline.\n\nWal-Mart didn't respond to a request for comment, but we talked to three smaller manufacturers about their experiences getting in the door and keeping their products on the shelves.\n\nCompany: Peak Enterprises, Sarasota, Florida\n\nProduct: Tung Brush and Tung Gel, oral-care products aimed at the hip, young-adult consumer.\n\nThe story: Tom Oechslin began selling his tongue-cleaning brushes in 1999. Positioned primarily as a clinical product sold to dentists and hygienists, he wanted a shot at the retail market and worked to secure shelf space with drugstore chains such as Rite Aid.\n\nIn 2001, he began pitching the brushes to Wal-Mart but was rejected for several years. Finally, in 2005, after working with a consultant to rebrand the product away from the clinical market toward a younger, retail buyer, the Tung Brush was given a trial in about 800 Wal-Mart stores.\n\nThere were some difficult roadblocks. While the buyer liked the product, the packaging was too wide to fit in the allotted shelf space; due to merchandise planning deadlines, Oechslin had only 48 hours to come up with a new prototype. He also had difficulties meeting initial production deadlines, as configuring manufacturing for the revised packaging required a special part from Germany.\n\nWal-Mart typically reviews product every six months, he says. At one point, the buyer told Oeschlin his numbers weren't living up to expectations, and he was prepared to get the boot. Instead, several months later, he received an email that distribution was going to be expanded.\n\nAdvice: \"When you go into Wal-Mart, you have to have all your ducks in a row,\" Oeschslin says. \"That means raising capital, finding the right manufacturer. Have the map in place, the whole program in place. It's a tremendous amount of preparation across the board.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n\nToday: Tung products are sold in some 3,500 Wal-Mart stores.\n\nCompany: ECOSmart Technologies, Atlanta, Georgia\n\nThe story: Former lawyer Steven Bessette founded ECOSmart in 1992. Initially the non-toxic pesticides were sold primarily though commercial channels such as professional exterminators and the agricultural industry. After making its commitment to sustainability, Wal-Mart called in Bessette in 2006 to talk about his product line.\n\nWithin two weeks of that initial meeting, he found himself in a room with a buyer. In 2007, three products designed for consumer use were tested in 80 stores throughout seven cities during a 10-week period.\n\nAdvice: Bessette says 15 years of credibility with the commercial and agricultural industries worked to his advantage. He was fulfilling a niche that no other large manufacturer had taken.\n\n\" think it really gave the buyer some confidence that we knew what we were talking about,\" he says. \"ECOSmart is the only product on the shelf that has a safety claim. If we didn't have that story to tell, how would they be able to tell the difference between that product and other conventional products on the shelf?\"\n\nToday: This year, ECOSmart products have been slated for distribution in more than 600 Wal-Mart stores throughout the United States. In order to meet increased demand, Bessette's team is partnering with a fulfillment house to handle logistics, a move he expects will save some 3 to 5 percentage points on shipping costs.\n\nCompany: Hyper Products, Wayzata, Minnesota.\n\nProduct: Pet toys and treats\n\nThe story: Ward Myers started Hyper Products in 2003. His background in the pet industry gave him the insight to get a patent on a slingshot device called the Hyper Dog. The product allowed pet owners to play fetch with large dogs without having to touch a slimy tennis ball. Soon after, he had secured shelf space in PETCO, as well as regional farm-and-feed chains.\n\nIn 2005, Myers decided to pitch the Wal-Mart account; industry connections helped him locate the buyer. Wal-Mart showed interest but had reservations about the product's clam-shell style packaging; it took up too much room and couldn't easily be stacked on shelves.\n\nMyers came back with a prototype package - a box adorned with four-color photographs; he was able to secure a commitment to get the product in several thousand Wal-Mart stores.\n\nAdvice: Don't pursue Wal-Mart straight out of gate, he says. Instead, reach for low-hanging fruit such as regional retailers that will help you learn the ins and outs of production and shipping deadlines.\n\n\"Really, if it's a smaller, newer company, do business with some smaller and regional chains,\" he says.\n\nOnce you do get in the door, give yourself wiggle room on pricing. \"I kind of went in there a bit higher,\" he says. \"I knew they would try to beat me up on price.\"\n\nToday: Hyper Products' business has grown along with Wal-Mart; the company now manufactures some 80 pet products, including Woodys, Doggie Driver and Hyper Retriever.\n\nDeborah Cohen covers small business for Reuters.com.

    "text": "Dave Dinkins (l.) lost to Rudy Giuliani in the 1993 mayoral race.\n\nHer name is Leslye Evans-Mills and she sat in a folding chair in the lobby of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts on Tuesday afternoon, down a long hall from where people had come to vote on this Primary Day.\n\nShe comes out of Harlem, Hamilton Heights, where her family has lived since 1939, and she was working as a door clerk at this polling place on this day in her city because she said she wanted to be involved in the process in any way she could.\n\nAnd in the early afternoon, after she told a young man in a G.I. Joe T-shirt and a wheelchair that he had come to the right place and pointed him down the hall, she made as much sense about this day and the upcoming election for mayor as anybody in town.\n\n\u201cWhen are people going to understand how much the landscape of this city might be about to change?\u201d Evans-Mills asked.\n\nShe knows what everybody who follows this political season knows now; that the city\u2019s voters are about to be given the most dramatic choice between two candidates since it was David Dinkins against Rudy Giuliani 20 years ago.\n\nA top city Democratic operative I know referenced that election on Tuesday night, talking about what it will be like if it is Bill de Blasio, who runs so far to the left you sometimes worry he will end up on the wrong side of the Hudson, running against an old Giuliani lieutenant like Joe Lhota.\n\nRELATED: BILL DE BLASIO LEADS BUT BILL THOMPSON COULD FORCE RUNOFF\n\n\u201cJoe needs to show he can run a real campaign but if he can put it together, it really is going to be the most exciting race and clash of visions for the direction of the city since \u201993,\u201d the guy said.\n\nAll along, the whole thing has seemed small because of the people running, even with a small forward like de Blasio towering over the other Democrats on the stage, to the point where one spectacular ad with a teenage kid in it \u2014 de Blasio\u2019s son \u2014 has so clearly helped turn things around in his favor.\n\nIt does not change how big this election is, how much does change if de Blasio is the next mayor, and not just because he has set himself apart from the field because of a vision for New York that is so vastly different from Mike Bloomberg\u2019s.\n\nOh, sure. The subtext of de Blasio\u2019s tale of two cities is really this \u2014 his New York City and Bloomberg\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIf people haven\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d Evans-Mills said at LaGuardia High, \u201cthey sure better start paying attention now. There\u2019s either going to be the New York we\u2019ve had lately, or the New York that these Democrats say they\u2019ve got to change it back into.\u201d\n\n\u201cBill de Blasio has run the best campaign with the clearest and most relatable message,\u201d is how the Democrat I spoke to put it. \u201cOthers were reactive with no rationale to vote for them. This was less about Bloomberg and more about (de Blasio) being someone with a clear, positive vision to change the city for the middle class and minority voters.\u201d\n\nRELATED: NYC MAYORAL HOPEFUL LHOTA WINS GOP PRIMARY\n\nBut then the guy added this: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to translate that to the general (election), though.\u201d\n\nOnce, when it was Giuliani and Dinkins, Giuliani beat an incumbent mayor by coming up as the candidate who would bang as many heads as necessary to clean up squeegee guys and Times Square and everything else. And won with that.\n\nThen came Bloomberg to run the city this well and for this long, running it like one of his businesses, the last truly independent mayor the city will ever see because nobody who came knocking on his door had anything he wanted. Along the way, he and Ray Kelly, a great police commissioner despite what you hear from Democrats these days, kept the city as safe in a post-Sept. 11 world as it could be. Now comes de Blasio thinking it is his time, the hot Democrat in a city where Democrats have the numbers, to say he is going to change everything back to the way it was when his friend Dinkins was mayor. And a Giuliani guy, Lhota, trying to stop him.\n\nMaybe people haven\u2019t been paying enough attention across the summer. They better pay attention in the fall. Sometimes you get a great election like this even without great candidates, when there is really only one issue, before jobs or the economy or crime or any of that:\n\nWhat kind of city do you want?",

Do not do Sudoku. Pay attention. There is lots of pretty and lots of rich in the NYC setting of most of the show.\n\nIn the prologue, we see a woman (Bridget) hiding from a man in ski mask with wrench\u2014in what looks to me like an art gallery showroom. While Patsy Cline sings \u201cI Fall to Pieces,\u201d she runs and he chases her, shouts \u201cYou have the wrong girl\u201d as he chokes her!\n\nNine days earlier, in Wyoming, she says \u201cmy name is Bridget, and I\u2019m an addict.\u201d She tells her story to the group.\n\nShe drives to a motel. Meets a man (who we will learn is F.B.I) who tells her just to get up on a stand and tell the judge what she saw. And she says if someone (didn\u2019t catch name) wants her dead, she\u2019s dead.\n\nIn the motel, she watches news coverage on the trial, and then the ball game, and back to the trial about the killing of Shalene Briggs in a strip club. She looks out the window and someone is out there watching.\n\nIn the morning the F.B.I. guy comes to get her and finds a man tied up in the shower.\n\nTwo days later, in East Hampton, Bridget, hair in an elegant bun, sits at a bar, a policeman comes in so she puts on dark glasses. He calls her to say she forgot her wallet.\n\nExcept it wsn\u2019t Bridget. She comes out of the bar and sees Bridget and says she was wondering how she\u2019d look after six years. They hug. So, they must be twins.\n\nShe takes Bridget to her elegant house. With a huge Warhol-esque black and white photo of Siobhan in the front. \u201cthis seems just like my house, except, not at all,\u201d Bridget says. Andrew, who must be her husband, is in London. They\u2019ve been married almost 5 years. Andrew doesn\u2019t know about her, Siobhan says. That she has a sister.\n\nBridget apologizes. Making amends is \u201cstep number nine, I did my research,\u201d says the other one. Bridget says she thinks about Sean every day. Who\u2019s that? Her sister says she\u2019s already forgiven.\n\nIn Rock Springs, Wyoming, Bridget\u2019s sponsor admits to F.B.I. guy that his relationship with her was close. He answers \u201cdo you love her?\u2019 with \u201cnone of your business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout her testimony, Ottawa\u2019s a free man,\u201d says the cop. He killed his own brother.\n\nAre you still dancing? Siobhan asks her sister, in a motorboat on the ocean. It\u2019s very glamorous.\n\nYou mean stripping? Nah. But I still work for tips. Siobhan, I don\u2019t want to be the sister you have to pretend doesn\u2019t exist, she says.\n\nBridget wakes up and doesn\u2019t see siobahn. There\u2019s an empty pill bottle on the floor. With a diamond ring in it. Siobhan! Siobhan! She shouts. Where is her sister??\n\nShe tries the CB but it seems dead.\n\nBridget jumps into the sea. Retrieves her sister\u2019s purse. Siobhan is nowhere to be found.\n\nBridget, hair done up like her sister, is in her sister\u2019s swanky Manhattan apartment. She kisses the husband who seems startled, \u201cAren\u2019t you friendly?\u201d he says. And he seems surprised that she\u2019s not upset that he doesn\u2019t want to go the ballet. \u201cThat was easy,\u201d he says.\n\nShe calls her sponsor. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve done.\u201d She tells him Siobhan killed herself and she doesn\u2019t know why. I am really digging the alt version of Chicago\u2019s \u201c25 or 6 to 4\u201d here.\n\n\u201cThey all think I\u2019m Siobhan,\u201d she says.\n\nSomebody menacing is staring up.\n\nWow, her sister has a nice apartment. I really want her closet.\n\nOoh and there\u2019s a gun in with the scarves.\n\nAnd of course hubby wont suspect if he is unaware Siobhan even has a twin!\n\nMorning and someone says \u201cyou were supposed to meet me in the loft half an hour ago!\u201d Andrew berates her for missing her trainer if it was because he said she was too skinny.\n\nShe brings her friend who I guess is the decorator of the gallery a latte. Gemma says \u201cYou look absolutely anorexic, you must tell me your secret!\u201d\n\nApparently they are moving the gallery again. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty,\u201d she says of the penthouse. Gemma notices how unexcited she seems.\n\nBridget offers to go out with her but she has a charity fundraiser. That night, someone sings opera. It\u2019s all very stiff, but the menacing guy is there. Andrew likes her red dress.\n\nI guess they\u2019re at a museum\u2014natural history\u2014because there are elephants with tusks. And just before the commercial a guy grabs her and begins making out. She says what the hell are you doing? And he complains the she just stared at him from the balcony like she was a crazy person. He insists she meet him at the hotel at noon. \u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous, Siobhan,\u201d he says.\n\nIt is tough work taking over someone\u2019s life who is lying.\n\nBack home, she asks her husband to unhook her. He does, and just walks away. I like her husband. It\u2019s Ioan Gruffudd, Horatio Hornblower! And he is still adorable. Why is she fooling around with someone when she\u2019s got him?\n\nWhy can\u2019t we just be nice to each other? She wonders when he rebuffs her.\n\nHe says who are you. You\u2019re just so different. You\u2019re relaxed and agreeable. He loves it. But he just doesn\u2019t believe it. Awww.\n\nOh Horatio. Come to mama. I would not cheat on you if you were mine.\n\nBridget looks at a picture in her sister\u2019s jewelry box and repeats the prayer that mistakes aren\u2019t tragedies, but please higher power, help her to learn from them.\n\nShe goes to a meeting somewhere in NY. She says I just got her back, now she\u2019s gone. I guess she\u2019s told the whole group about her imposture. And has she never watched \u201cLaw & Order SVU\u201d? She is so busted.\n\nShe goes home and finds Juliet in bed with a guy, wearing her scarf. I\u2019m not sure who these people are. Siobhan\u2019s daughter?\n\nJuliet says the only reason daddy sent her to boarding school was because of you. Stepdaughter, then. Juliet picks up the phone, yeah whatever, some guy\u2019s coming up to see you. That does make me laugh. It\u2019s the policeman from Wisconsin.\n\nMy mother observes that she is enjoying the fashion and the d\u00e9cor, but wonders why anybody would want her sister\u2019s awful life. Although the closets are like the Piper Lime wall on Project Runway.\n\nWow, far cry from Wyoming, you ever been? Says the cop. Victor Machado, F.B.I. He wants to talk to her about her sister. Bridget\u2019s a fugitive, he says,, she assaulted a police officer and stole his weapon. She was supposed to testify but didn\u2019t. and the man is free and they want to make sure he goes back to prison. He asks Mrs. Martin who he doesn\u2019t know is Bridget to say something.\n\nBack in Wyoming, somebody menacing in a car watches Malcolm come out of a building.\n\nBridget is in an art gallery? It\u2019s confusing. Gemma sees her and says Siobhan? Gemma jokes about who her husband could be having an affair with. \u201cwife\u2019s best friend?\u2019 then she laughs \u201cI\u2019m joking.\u201d\n\nWe see Siobhan with Gemma\u2019s husband. \u201cGemma\u2019s on to us,\u201d she says to Henry.\n\nAndrew yells at Juliet and says \u201cyou could have gone to jail.\u201d She threatens to go to Mom\u2019s and when her dad says it\u2019s not an option Juliet replies \u201cjust throw it in my face that she doesn\u2019t want me either.\u201d He says it\u2019s not what he meant.\n\nThe phone rings and Dr. Martin calls and says she missed her appointment. Her bloodwork came back positive. She\u2019s four weeks along. Siobhan\u2019s husband hears her. In the mirror Bridget says Siobhan what did you do?\n\nWhy would she kill herself if she was pregnant?\n\nIf I were married to Horatio Hornblower and rich and pregnant you would not find me leaping off a boat.\n\nI\u2019m beginning to think Siobhan was murdered. I mean, if she was hard enough to cheat with her best friend\u2019s husband, what would make her want to die? And why was her ring in the pill box?\n\nAnd Bridget is at a party with her friend and her friend\u2019s husband who says \u201cSo that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t been drinking!\u201d and congratulate them. How is she going to fake this? Will she just get pregnant?\n\nYou know that\u2019s my baby, says Henry. He wants her to leave him. Make a choice, him or me. I actually respect him for that. It probably was his baby.\n\nBut Bridget chooses her (that is, Siobhan\u2019s) husband, who was on the phone taking a hard line with someone or other.\n\nBridget changes the subject to Juliet. Who got kicked out of boarding school. For drugs. Bridget tries to say she cant stay there\u2014the addict\u2019s fear \u201cnot with the baby coming,\u201d she punts. But he says come on shiv, you know she has nowhere else to go.\n\nGemma leaves an anguished message on Siobhan\u2019s phone, that she knows who her husband was cheating with. But she must not, because if she did, that message would be sounding different.\n\nAnd now we seem to be at the prologue.\n\nThe guy with the ski mask is there.\n\nAnd so is the Patsy Cline song. \u201cYou have the wrong girl!\u201d she kicks him, nice kick, and some beams fall down. They are stunned and Bridget finds the gun (she found it there earlier) and shoots him saying \u201cI\u2019m not Bridget.\u201d But we know she is.\n\nIn his pocket is a picture of Siobhan. Dang. He was not even coming for her.\n\nIn Paris, Siobhan is alive! She picks up the phone. Someone says Siobhan, we have a problem.\n\nWho is trying to kill whom for what?",

    "text": "While the hot-blooded Berlusconi was for many years a master of forming political alliances, Monti is known for his achievements as a \"Eurocrat,\" at the heart of Europe's institutions.\n\nDubbed Super Mario for his work in international finance, he served as a leading European Commission member for a decade -- including as commissioner for its financial services, market and taxation committee between 1995 and 1999 and as head of its competition committee from 1999 to 2004.\n\nIn the latter role, Monti gained prominence for his part in blocking a merger between U.S. firms Honeywell International and General Electric, thought to be a move that highlighted Europe's newfound regulatory clout.\n\nHe also tangled with U.S. computing giant Microsoft, ruling in 2004 that it had broken EU competition law by having \"abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe.\" Microsoft was hit with a huge fine and ordered to share key information with its rivals.\n\nWhile such moves made headlines, Monti's interactions in business are still a stark contrast to that of Berlusconi.\n\nBesides being active in politics, the outgoing prime minister is also a business personality as the owner of media and financial companies, as well as the legendary football club A.C. Milan.\n\nBut beyond advisory roles with investment firm Goldman Sachs and Coca-Cola, Monti's resume suggests he's as much a creature of academics and policy-making as business.\n\nBorn in 1943 in the town of Varese in northern Italy's Lombardy region, Monti earned an economics and business degree from Milan's Bocconi University. He then did his post-graduate studies at Yale University, before returning to Europe.\n\nIn 2005, shortly after leaving the European Commission, according to a bio on that international organization's website, Monti launched Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank focused on economic issues.\n\nThe next few years saw Monti remain busy in international affairs. That includes being appointed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy to a panel to look at promoting French economic growth, as well as helping broker a 2008 electricity-sharing agreement between France and Spain.\n\nAll the while, he has appeared to remain closely linked to his alma mater, Bocconi. Holding the position rector from 1989 to 1994, the university notes that Monti is president of the school.",

    "text": "President Obama spoke from the White House about Syria beginning just after 9 p.m. ET. Stay here for real-time reaction on the president\u2019s address.\n\nnew content is available. click to update.\n\nAs President Obama repeats that his goal for military strikes \u2014 \u201cdeterring\u201d the use of chemical weapons \u2014 he makes no mention of punishment for Assad having used them. That seems to avoid the \u201cconsequences\u201d for the Aug. 21 strike that he and other officials initially said was part of their justification for the proposed attack.\n\nIf the Russian proposal goes ahead and the strike is canceled in exchange for international monitoring and destruction of Syria\u2019s chemicals, \u201cconsequences\u201d would apparently go away.\n\nAs the president wrapped up his remarks, CBS News anchor Scott Pelley summed it up thusly for viewers: \u201cLike the presidential seal, President Obama had an olive branch in one hand and arrows in the other.\u201d\n\nOne of the first lawmakers to react to President Obama\u2019s Syria speech was Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Menendez said that while he has doubts about the possibility of a diplomatic solution to the situation, it would be wrong to shut the door on the possibility. His full statement:\n\n\u201cThe diplomatic door has opened ever so slightly, and while I have doubts about this 11th hour offer, it would be wrong to slam the door shut without due consideration. A negotiated solution to a crisis is always preferable and if this possibility is legitimate, I\u2019ll give it serious thought. At the same time, the credible use of military force is necessary to keep on the table.\n\n\u201cWe arrived at this moment as a direct result of action taken last week by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when we passed a bipartisan Authorization for Use of Military Force and made clear our intention to act in the national security interest if the Assad regime refuses to abide by international norms against the use of chemical weapons. I am now working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider this diplomatic initiative within the context of the committee\u2019s resolution. Should diplomacy fail, an authorization of force will send an unequivocal message to the Assad regime and other international actors that the use of chemical weapons will be met with a military response to prevent their use and proliferation.\u201d\n\nWhat was billed as a major address wound up clocking in at just a hair over 15 minutes.\n\nBefore the speech, rumor had it that it would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 10-15 minutes \u2014 likely shorter than it might have been before the diplomatic progress of the last few days.\n\nObama used his brief time to respond to broadly held concerns about the mission.\n\nA White House spokesman offered the rationale for that:\n\nPresident Obama painted a picture of a very high-stakes situation in Syria with a far-reaching impact.\n\n\u201cOur ideals and principles as well as our national security are at stake in Syria,\u201d Obama declared near the end of his speech.\n\nThroughout his address, the president time and again sought to make the case to the American people that an overseas situation matters at home. We will find out in the coming days if it shifts public opinion, which heretofore has been decidedly against military action.\n\nPresident Obama took a moment to tell members of both parties why they should support military action in Syria.\n\n\u201cTo my friends on the right, I ask you to reconcile America\u2019s failure to act \u2026 when a cause is so plainly just,\u201d Obama said, noting the GOP\u2019s emphasis on military strength.\n\nAs for the left, Obama noted the humanitarian nightmare that exists in Syria, saying it should appeal to bleeding hearts.\n\nPresident Obama said it is \u201ctoo early\u201d to judge whether the Russian plan for Syria to give up control of its chemical weapons will work. But, he said, he is asking congressional leaders to postpone a vote on military action while he looks into it.\n\nThe question is the timetable \u2014 how long will he be looking into it? And when will he judge that Syria will or will not abide by an agreement?\n\nKeep an eye on how much Obama focuses on punishing the Syrian regime versus preventing it from using chemical weapons again.\n\nThe current debate over Russia\u2019s proposal for Syria to turn over its chemical weapons solves the latter issue but not the former.\n\nIf Obama focuses on the latter, it suggests that he may not be as likely to strike Syria if the Russian proposal is successful.\n\nWhile Obama emphasized the importance of sending a message when it comes to Syria and chemical weapons, he also emphasized \u201dthe purpose of this strike would be to deter Assad from using chemical weapons and to degrade\u201d his capabilities.\n\nPresident Obama pitched his case that the alleged chemical attack in Syria is not just an isolated incident that affects the region, but is also a danger to the security of the United States.\n\nThe attack, Obama said, is not just a violation of international law, but \u201cit\u2019s danger to our security.\u201d\n\nPart of Obama\u2019s challenge in shifting public opinion is convincing Americans why the situation in Syria matters to them. And his remarks reflect he understands that challenge.",

    "text": "Here are the highlights from President Obama's speech on immigration, in which he outlined his executive action to shield 4 million illegal immigrants from deportation. (Ashleigh Joplin/The Washington Post)\n\nOn the day after President Obama\u2019s historic announcement of a plan to protect millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, hundreds of Latino activists and families gathered in front of the White House Friday afternoon to express their gratitude \u2014 and also vow to press Congress to finish the job.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the president is going to change the lives of 5 million people forever,\u201d said Gustavo Torres, executive director of CASA de Maryland and Virginia, the major regional advocacy group for illegal immigrants, shortly before the rally. \u201cToday is a day for all of us to celebrate and thank him for delivering on his promise. We are all very touched and moved by what he has done.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Torres said Friday will be the \u201clast day of celebration,\u201d because the immigrant community needs to turn its attentions immediately to Congress and the unfinished business of comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n\u201cWe need to get ready to continue the fight,\u201d said Torres, whose organization is one of five groups sponsoring the rally in Lafayette Square. \u201cWe have made history, but we cannot wait, because millions of people have still not gotten the help they need. We need to start pushing the Republican Party really hard to pass a bill.\u201d\n\nSome immigrants at the rally, which was attended by about 200 to 300 people, expressed mixed emotions about Obama\u2019s announcement. They said they were grateful for his efforts but disappointed that the president had stopped short of legalizing several million other people, including many adults with no children and others whose children were legalized under his 2012 order.\n\nKevin Escobar, a 17-year-old who cross the border eight months ago to be reunited with his mother in the District, said young people like him would also like to get some relief.\n\n\u201cI am happy for the people who will benefit from this, and will get their papers, but there are many others who are here in search of safety and a better future,\u201d said Escobar, who said he left his native El Salvador to escape from the violent killing of young children.\n\n\u201cYou are at risk of dying just because you are young,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no other choice, but to come here.\u201d\n\nHis mother, who has been in the United States for 11 years, won\u2019t qualify under Obama\u2019s plan, he said. \u201cShe has worked hard and has paid her taxes but she is not covered because I wasn\u2019t born here.\u201d\n\nAlejandra Sanchez, 42, a woman from Arizona with two legalized children, fasted outside the White House for more than a week to call attention to the plight of \u201cdreamer moms\u201d like her. On Friday, she said she felt admiration for Obama but also \u201ca little disillusioned.\u201d\n\nShe held up a poster that was printed with a message thanking the president, but she had written on it in Spanish, \u201cWhy did you leave out 6 million.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s action is expected to benefit about 4 million of the nation\u2019s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.\n\nTens of thousands of illegal immigrants in the Washington region, mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, are expected to benefit from Obama\u2019s action, either because they are parents of U.S.-born children or because they arrived in the country as children.\n\nCASA officials have predicted that up to 100,000 people in the area will obtain a three-year reprieve from deportation next year after applying to immigration officials. Under Obama\u2019s plan, they will need to provide proof of a clean police record and their years of residency in the United States, as well as pay several hundred dollars in fees. Immigration offices are expected to begin receiving applications in six months.\n\nA few feet away from the rally, a protester in military fatigues shouted through a bullhorn, \u201cYou are all illegal\u201d and \u201cObama is the number one coyote,\u201d using a word for guides who smuggle migrants into the U.S. The man refused to identify himself to a reporter.\n\nObama was not in the White House on Friday. He was in Las Vegas to attend a rally supporting his initiative.\n\nIn a statement early Friday, CASA said the White House rally would be attended by several Latino families who will either benefit from Obama\u2019s action or are not being covered by it and risk deportation for at least one family member.\n\nAmong the beneficiaries scheduled to come to the rally are Peter and Marlene Uribe, a couple from Maryland who immigrated in 1997 from Chile with a daughter, now 17, who won deferred deportation under Obama\u2019s 2012 action, and a younger daughter who was born in the United States, enabling the couple to quality for Obama\u2019s new order.\n\nAnother immigrant CASA said hopes to be covered by his action is Catia Paz, who came from El Salvador in 2003, graduated from high school, worked continuously and bought a home in Maryland. Her husband has legal status, and their two daughters were born in the United States, but she faces a deportation order that will take effect in May unless she is able to successfully apply for Obama\u2019s plan.\n\nFrancisco Diaz, 40, an activist from Florida who spent much of the past several weeks with protesters in Lafayette Square, came to the rally early and said he planned to return to Miami Saturday to start preparing immigrants there to apply for deferred deportation under Obama\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to miss out on this chance,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will need to start gathering documents, and we also want to tell them to watch out for lawyers and notaries who will try to cheat them.\u201d\n\nPamela Constable covers issues related to immigration policy, immigrant communities and international figures and issues that crop up in our local and regional midst.",

He has supported her for years, including paying to produce a slick video tribute chronicling her tenure at the State Department as she was set to depart in early 2013.\n\nBut even as he bemoaned the loss of a sense of safety, Mr. Saban said that he believes Mrs. Clinton will ultimately benefit politically as a result of the attacks.\n\n\u201cI do think it will help because she\u2019s the only one with the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and the most qualified to deal with this,\u201d Mr. Saban said.",

    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Forget Fort Knox or the Federal Reserve. Texas has decided to start keeping its gold holdings within in its own borders. But what makes sense politically in such a sovereignty-loving place is creating a logistical conundrum.\n\nTexas is the only state that owns an actual stockpile of gold, according to public sector and financial industry experts \u2014 not just gold futures or investment positions, but approximately 5,600 gold bars worth around $650 million. The holdings, stored at a New York bank, for some harken back to century-old fears about the security of currency not backed by shiny bullion.\n\nThe Legislature\u2019s decision this summer to bring its gold cache home was hailed by many conservatives, and even some on the far left, who are suspicious of national government.\n\n\u201cThere will always be the exact same amount of gold in there as the amount that was put in,\u201d no matter what happens to the financial system, said Republican state Rep. Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, a former tea party organizer from the Dallas suburbs who authored the gold bill.\n\nBut for the Texas comptroller\u2019s office, which has to implement the policy, the catch is that the new Texas Bullion Depository exists in name but not reality.\n\nThe law doesn\u2019t say where the depository would be or how it should be built or secured. No funding was provided for those purposes or for leasing space elsewhere. Further complicating matters is a provision allowing ordinary people to check their own gold or silver bullion into the facility.\n\n\u201cWe are honestly at the phase where the questions we are answering are creating more questions that we have to answer,\u201d said Chris Bryan, a comptroller\u2019s office spokesman.\n\nCharged with figuring everything out is a four-member task force within the comptroller\u2019s office, which recently dispatched an official to a precious metals conference to study up.\n\nOne immediate concern is the possible cost. When Fort Knox was completed in 1936 it cost $560,000 \u2014 or roughly $9.2 million in today\u2019s dollars. When Capriglione first introduced his bill in 2013 it had an estimated cost of $23 million.\n\nBut Capriglione now thinks private companies would bid to create a depository in exchange for charging storage and service fees.\n\nThe plan has kicked up chatter outside of Texas that it\u2019s a step toward secession, an idea raised now and then on the state\u2019s farthest political fringe.\n\n\u201cJust moving it would be pretty expensive and, unless Texas is anticipating withdrawing from the union, which I suspect is some peoples\u2019 want, I don\u2019t see what advantage it is\u2026,\u201d said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics who has written about gold and monetary policy. \u201cWhat are you getting for what you\u2019re paying for?\u201d\n\nBut Capriglione says he\u2019s just convinced that gold is safer, especially close at hand.\n\nAfter the bill sailed through the Legislature, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed it and tweeted: \u201cCalifornia may be the golden state, but Texans deserve to keep their gold in-state!\u201d\n\nTexas\u2019 state-owned gold is held by the University of Texas Investment Management Company, the nation\u2019s second largest academic endowment behind Harvard. It began gradually amassing gold futures in 2009 as a hedge against currency weakness in the recession. It eventually transitioned to physical bullion, and by 2011 had $1 billion worth.\n\nThe price of gold has since mostly slumped amid a soaring stock market. Today, the fund\u2019s gold bars represent about 2.5 percent of its $25.4 billion in holdings, said Chief Executive Officer Bruce Zimmerman.\n\nAsked about the new depository, Zimmerman said, \u201cWe don\u2019t do politics. We\u2019re just investors.\u201d\n\nThe Fed declined comment on the new Texas depository, as did HSBC bank, which currently stores the gold bars in an underground vault in Manhattan.\n\nStacked together, the state\u2019s gold occupies about 20 square feet. It\u2019s unclear whether repatriating it could be done with an electronic transfer or would require a fleet of planes or armored cars.\n\nOne possible effect of the new depository might be more attention to the idea of returning to the gold standard, long a cause of former Texas Rep. Ron Paul. The Federal Reserve was founded more than a century ago so that the value of the U.S. dollar no longer had to be anchored to gold, and Richard Nixon formally scrapped the gold standard in 1971.\n\n\u201cI think Texas is once again showing they\u2019re ahead of the curve,\u201d said James Rickards, author of the 2014 book \u201cThe Death of Money: The Coming Collapse of the International Monetary System.\u201d \u201dThey\u2019re not waiting for the disaster, but preparing for it.\u201d",

    "text": "\"This is the opening salvo,\" said David W. Barno, a retired Army lieutenant general and former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nIn a bid to save money, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates announced Thursday that the Marine Corps would shed between 15,000 and 20,000 members and the Army 27,000 soldiers starting in 2015, the first time either service has faced reductions in troop strength since the mid-1990s.\n\nThe cuts are timed to coincide with what is expected to be a large-scale withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, where the Kabul government has pledged to take lead responsibility for its security by the end of 2014.\n\nMeantime, U.S. forces are slated to withdraw completely from Iraq by the end of this year.\n\nIf those schedules hold and no new wars erupt, analysts predicted the military will confront calls from Congress to roll back troop levels even further, perhaps to levels not seen since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\n\"That pressure is going to be inevitable,\" said Barno, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a national security think tank with close ties to the Obama administration.\n\nThere are currently about 202,000 Marines on active duty, up from 175,000 in 2007. The Army has about 569,000 soldiers on active duty, including a temporary increase of 22,000 that is already scheduled to lapse in 2013.\n\nThe permanent rollbacks will be complete by 2016 and will save $6 billion over two years. Gates said the cuts were prompted by the country's \"dire fiscal situation.\" But he noted that the Army and Marines will still be larger - by 40,000 soldiers and 7,000 to 12,000 Marines - than when he took over as defense secretary in December 2006.\n\nSenior military officials said they supported the troop cuts, but warned against going any deeper.\n\n\"Any significant additional budget cuts can almost only be met - keeping us whole, not hollowing us out - can only be met through substantial reductions in force structure, and that's against the national security requirements that we see in the world we're living in,\" Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Thursday.\n\nThe Bush administration and Congress agreed to bolster the Marines and Army in 2007 as part of the troop surge in the Iraq war. Although large numbers of troops have since withdrawn from Iraq, many others have deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Obama administration's surge there.",

Would I quit my job? I don\u2019t know that yet. I don\u2019t know how to best contribute.\u201d\n\nThe conversation about whether to stay or go is repeating itself at countless dinner tables, in urgent telephone calls and in posts on Facebook, particularly among highly educated and younger Egyptians who may have the most to lose by leaving the United States, but also the most to gain.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us are not seriously considering moving there,\u201d said Nadine Wahab, 34, a public relations executive in Washington and a leader of the Egyptian Association for Change, which helped organize protests throughout the United States during the last several weeks. \u201cEveryone is asking, What can I do? What would I be going back to? Where am I going to make the most impact?\u201d\n\nThere are roughly 300,000 Egyptians living in the United States, according to the most recent census data, with the largest concentrations in Southern California and New York, and a smaller but close-knit cluster in the Washington area.\n\nHana Elhattab left Egypt five years ago to start college at the University of Maryland. Her parents had moved to the area three years earlier and Ms. Elhattab figured she was saying goodbye to Egypt for good.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to move back ever,\u201d she recalled telling people. \u201cBut the moment Mubarak was going to be gone, I knew I was going back.\u201d\n\nSince graduating last year, Ms. Elhattab has worked as a policy analyst for a Middle East research group in Washington. When the protests began last month in Cairo, Ms. Elhattab immediately began translating Twitter posts from Arabic to share with an English-speaking audience.\n\n\u201cEverything I have done since I got here has been about creating a career here,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I have to start that over and figure out what is going to be relevant and helpful there. I need to do something that is a real job. I don\u2019t want to go and just be another liability there.\u201d\n\nFirst, Ms. Elhattab plans to look for a job in international development in the United States and to go to graduate school, which means it could be two or three years before she returns to Egypt. \u201cIf I could go tomorrow, I would,\u201d she said.\n\nThe same kind of anxious impatience is tugging at Rania Behiri, 31, who left Egypt with her family when she a toddler. She traveled back often, though, and last year married Rami Serry, an Egyptian racecar driver she met through the Internet.\n\nMs. Behiri was reluctant to move her two sons from a previous marriage to Egypt from West Covina, Calif., and Mr. Serry refused to leave Cairo, so the two resigned themselves to a long-distance marriage.\n\nBut last week Ms. Behiri quickly changed her mind, and she is preparing to move next month with her sons, 9 and 12. When she arrives in Egypt, she plans to work for a professional development company her father-in-law runs. A group of Egyptian-born businessmen are working on a fund-raiser in the next several weeks to help her.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t have trust, they don\u2019t have faith and they have been just so oppressed and messed up by the laws that they need to learn how to think for themselves,\u201d Ms. Behiri said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be invaluable. This whole thing showed that people truly can make a difference \u2014 so now I feel like, of course, I want to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nMs. Behiri is one of countless Egyptian immigrants speaking in such grand terms these days, driven by what they saw happen in their birthplace. Many of the Egyptians here say they hope to educate people back home before elections and will press for the right to vote as well.\n\nA week after Mubarak's fall, crowds gather to celebrate.\n\nAfter years of oppression, Ms. Behiri said, many Egyptians might be deceived by unscrupulous or power-hungry politicians. Friends her age, she said, could be so focused on improving Egypt\u2019s economy that they are willing to overlook religious demands by public officials.\n\nIt is not uncommon for exiles to return to their native country to help with rebuilding efforts after a revolution. Less than a decade ago, millions of Afghan refugees were repatriated after the United States-led coalition ousted the Taliban government, and many of them found a place in government, including Hamid Karzai, who is now president.\n\nMany Egyptians come to the United States on student visas, planning to earn graduate degrees and to look for a job in academia. For years, many of them scrambled to find jobs outside Egypt. They worried that working as a professor there would not provide enough money to support a family. More worrisome, they said, was the prospect of limited academic freedom.\n\nNora Muharram and her husband, Said Fares, assumed that they would try to find a way to remain in the United States once he finished his doctorate in Islamic studies at the U.C.L.A. this spring.\n\n\u201cWe never looked forward to going back,\u201d Ms. Muharram said. \u201cThe environment would not allow him to publish the kinds of papers he wanted to do or give my children the kind of education I wanted for them. Now all of that has changed, and we are very, very optimistic.\u201d\n\nMs. Muharram said she was confident that with her background as an electrical engineer, she would be able to find a job.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to want a better life, to change things, to do something,\u201d she said, her voice rising in excitement. \u201cThe picture is still not clear, but at least now I am hearing the hope from everyone.\u201d",

    "text": "In May 2000, around half of Walkerton\u2019s 5,000 residents fell severely ill and seven people died when cow manure washed into a well. The extent of the water pollution in the small Canadian town was concealed from the public, people drank from their taps and the result was ruined lives.\n\nFor academic microbiologist Joan Rose, who has observed water pollution outbreaks around the world, it was the worst that she had ever experienced.\n\n\u201cIt affected me the most. Walkerton is a small small farming community. The people there were very gracious. Two pathogens came in to their water supply. They did not know children would die, or would suffer kidney failure and be on on dialysis for the rest of their lives. I saw what it did to people. I saw the pain.\u201d\n\nWalkerton was one of Canada\u2019s worst-ever pollution incidents but there are hundreds of similar incidents every year around the world, albeit mostly less serious, says Prof Rose, who is laboratory director in water research at Michigan State University.\n\nMost come from people drinking water contaminated with sewage, she says. \u201cIn the US there are 12-18m cases of human water-borne diseases a year. In developing countries it is possible that one in three hospital cases may be due to contamination of water. We do not know exactly how bad it is but 1.5 billion people do not have access to adequate sewage treatment.\u201d\n\nRose, who this week was presented with the world\u2019s most prestigious prize for water at a conference in Stockholm, is alternately depressed and optimistic at progress to clean the world\u2019s water supplies and make water fit to drink.\n\n\u201cWe have started to decrease mortality for waterborne diseases but the big problem now is morbidity [disease-related]. People are getting more sick. We are now more polluted than we have ever been\u201d.\n\nThe statistics are dismal. This week the UN Environment Programme reported that \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of people face health risks like cholera and typhoid from pathogens in water. Water pollution in Asia, Africa and Latin America is worsening, said the report, with pathogen pollution now in more than half of all rivers stretches on the three continents.\n\n\u201cThere are 7 billion people and most of their waste is going into water. The water quality of lakes, rivers and coastal shorelines around the world is degrading at an alarming rate. There has been a great acceleration since the 1950s of human and animal populations, water withdrawals, pesticide and fertiliser use. But at the same time there has been a deceleration, or shrinkage, in wetlands,\u201d says Rose.\n\n\u201cWe are changing our lands. Land is the source of contamination, but climate is the driver [of contamination]. We know that the intensity of rainfall, storms and droughts is changing. More than 50% of community waterborne illness events in the US each year are associated with extreme rain.\u201d\n\nWhen it rains heavily or floods, pathogens like Leptospira, hepatitis, norovirus and cryptosporidium are all significant, she says. \u201cThere is a direct link between water pollution, certain food-borne disease outbreaks and warmer oceans. Temperature, precipitation, humidity and flooding are all factors in contamination of water and food systems by pathogens. Many developing nations suffer terribly from illnesses caused by lack of sewage treatment facilities which are exasperated by climate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, sewage contains well over 100 different viruses. Newly emerging viruses such as Cycloviruses, which are causing neurological problems in children in Asia, are also emerging in sewage and are spreading.\n\n\u201cPollution is spreading to every part of the world. Everywhere is now under huge new attack from viruses and pathogens,\u201d she says.\n\nRose has led research into how new pathogens and viruses are being spread around the world by hitching rides in the ballast water which ships take on to stabilise them on long journeys. They are picking up viruses in one ocean or sea and bringing them to others, she says\n\n\u201cWe are infecting the food chain, and the whole system. I am thinking what are we missing about the bio-health of the planet. What do we know about what is happening in the wild? Frogs are dying, starfish are dying. We focus so much on humans we don\u2019t know about much else. Every part of the world is now under huge new attack from viruses and pathogens.\u201d\n\nThe answer, she says, must be massive investment in water infrastructure. \u201cBut in the US alone, it\u2019s estimated that what is needed is $70 per person per day for 10 years. In developing countries its far more.\u201d\n\nBut it has to be worth it, she says. \u201cAccess to clean water is a central stabilising force in societies and lack of access destabilises societies. As a microbiologist, I believe that the provision of safe drinking water is the basic building block of a healthy and successful society.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to progress when you are fighting cholera, or when there is an epidemic of child malnutrition as in India due to exposure to untreated water contaminated with fecal waste.\u201d\n\nThe better news, she says, is that scientists can now monitor pathogens better and track their sources. \u201cWhat took three weeks to diagnose now takes 24 hours. There is more public support, more money, more political will to clean up water. We have more knowledge and more willingness to pay.\n\n\u201cThe key is education, specifically development of a global water curriculum to prepare the next generation of problem solvers. The need is enormous.\u201d",

    "text": "Ending a 14-month search, the Barnes Foundation announced yesterday that it had appointed a prominent Philadelphia arts figure as its executive director.\n\nRyan Donnell for The New York Times\n\nDerek Gillman was named the director of the Barnes Foundation.\n\nHe is Derek Gillman, 53, president and chief executive of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, a prestigious art school and museum known for its collection of 19th- and 20th-century American paintings. Trustees at the Barnes cited Mr. Gillman\u0092s experience with complex museum expansion projects, a familiarity crucial to the Barnes as it charts the move of its fabled collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art from suburban Merion to a new building in downtown Philadelphia.\n\n\u0093We had to look hard for someone who combined several things,\u0094 said Neil L. Rudenstine, a member of the Barnes board and of the search committee for a new director. \u0093Derek has an imaginative, probing mind and educational experience. He also knows how to build buildings and to fund-raise.\u0094\n\nMr. Gillman plans to take over in October, succeeding Kimberly Camp, who announced her resignation in June 2005 after serving as executive director for seven years.\n\nMr. Rudenstine said it was only \u0093happenstantial\u0094 that Mr. Gillman led a Philadelphia institution. He said that the Barnes\u0092s search was international in scope, with more than 130 candidates expressing interest. \u0093We started out with no geographical ideas,\u0094 Mr. Rudenstine said.\n\nStill, having worked at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts since 1999, Mr. Gillman has had a chance to witness the Barnes\u0092s problems at close range. Arguing that it was on the brink of a bankruptcy filing, the foundation won court approval in December 2004 to defy the charter and bylaws of the museum\u0092s mercurial founder, Albert C. Barnes, which specified that no picture could be lent, sold or even moved from the walls of the neo-Classical galleries that he had built for the collection in the mid-1920\u0092s.\n\nThe move, which has been opposed by some neighbors, students and many arts professionals, is being backed by three local foundations \u0097 the Pew Charitable Trusts and the Lenfest and Annenberg foundations \u0097 which collectively have helped to raise more than $150 million to support the project. In March the Pennsylvania state government provided a $25 million grant for the move to a site on Benjamin Franklin Parkway.\n\n\u0093This is not a low-profile institution, nor is it a low-profile challenge,\u0094 Mr. Gillman said in a telephone interview on Sunday. \u0093But it\u0092s an incredibly important one.\u0094 He said that while familiarity with the Philadelphia arts community might not have been a priority for the board, it helped him \u0093understand the lay of the landscape.\u0094\n\nAmong his priorities, he said, would be molding the idiosyncratic Barnes into a more professional institution, planning for a new building to house the vast collection and examining the foundation\u0092s educational programs. \u0093But not necessarily in that order,\u0092\u0092 he said.\n\nA resident of Merion, he is quick to say that he does not share the views of some of his neighbors who have formed a passionate group called Friends of the Barnes to fight the move on the grounds that the collection is being torn away from its intended setting.\n\n\u0093I see signs on people\u0092s lawns to save the Barnes,\u0094 Mr. Gillman said, \u0093but not everyone in Merion agrees.\u0094\n\nMr. Gillman, who is British-born, came to the Pennsylvania academy as executive director and provost in 1999. Two years later he became its president and chief executive. He has led a five-year, $50 million expansion in which all of its academic departments were consolidated into one campus.\n\nHe also pursued a sell-off of its European paintings at the academy to raise money for the acquisition of more American art.\n\nWhen pressed, he said he had not thought about selling any works in the vast Barnes collection, which includes 181 Renoirs, 69 C\u00e9zannes, 46 Picassos and 59 Matisses, in addition to the African, American and decorative arts.\n\nNor has he contemplated what architect he might favor for the Barnes\u0092s new building, he said. \u0093I\u0092ve worked with a range of architects, from local ones to international superstars,\u0094 he said. \u0093All were good, but very different.\u0094\n\nMr. Gillman began his career in 1981 as a curator at the British Museum in London and later served as director of the Sainsbury Center for Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia, where he was involved in an expansion by Sir Norman Foster. In 1995 he was named deputy director of the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, when it was in the midst of a renovation and expansion.\n\nMr. Gillman said he strongly supported the move from Merion to Philadelphia. The Barnes is \u0093an international treasure which millions of people will be able to see,\u0094 he said.\n\nMr. Gillman said that he did intend to honor the educational ideas set forth by Dr. Barnes and by the philosopher John Dewey, who promoted art and education for all people and was appointed the foundation\u0092s first director of education in 1923. \u0093I want to go back in time and study that vision,\u0094 Mr. Gillman said, \u0093and then figure out how to extend and enrich the programs.\u0094\n\nImpressionist and post-Impressionist art is not Mr. Gillman\u0092s area of expertise. He studied Chinese art at Oxford University, although over the years he has worked with collections ranging from Asian, African and Renaissance art on through art of the 20th century and, more recently, American art in particular. He said he intended to hire a chief curator to oversee the Barnes collection but did not envision a big increase in the foundation\u0092s staff.\n\nAsked if he expected the Barnes eventually to become part of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a rumor that has been circulating in the museum community for years, he gave a firm \u0093no.\u0094\n\n\u0093The Barnes is moving to become fully self-sustaining,\u0094 he said. \u0093That\u0092s the whole purpose. It will be the master of its own fate.\u0094",

Newly named Nandi made her public debut on Sept. 19, and she is happily fitting in with the rest of her herd, including her dad, Mabu, and siblings Punga and Sundzu. The calf is allowed access to the public-facing side of the elephant exhibit daily from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.\n\nThe newest resident at Hershey, Penn.'s ZooAmerica has a slightly different background story than most zoo babies. Rainier, a mountain lion kitten, was found abandoned and malnourished on a porch near Spokane, Wash. After the Department of Fish and Wildlife made unsuccessful attempts to reunite the kitten with his mother, he was taken into veterinary care and transferred to ZooAmerica. Though he weighed less than five pounds upon arrival, he was named for the tallest mountain peak in Washington State in hopes that he'll grow big and strong.\n\nOn Aug. 23, mother Dhati and father Madhu welcomed a baby Indian pygmy gosling into the world at Palm Beach Zoo. While most of the species' hatchlings born in zoos over the past few decades didn't make it to adulthood, zookeepers are optimistic about this little one who loves to swim and paddle. Visitors can spot the gosling in the Beuttenmuller Asian Aviary.\n\nArchibald the red panda cub was born in June, and unfortunately, as the runt of the litter, he was rejected by his mother. Mill Mountain Zoo staff stepped in to hand-rear him, bottle feeding the little guy, and taking him home at night. Now they are setting up a panda nursery for him and another orphaned red panda cub that will be arriving soon so he can learn to socialize with his own species. Archie will only remain in Roanake until he is 9 months old, and then he will be placed in another zoo via the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' (AZA) Species Survival Plan. While he probably won't be on public display at the Mill Mountain Zoo, his sister has made her debut in the panda den and has been spending a few hours a day in full view.\n\nKya, a Chinese muntjac fawn, was born on Sept. 19 at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, N.Y. Muntjacs are the oldest known deer, with fossilized remains from 15-35 million years ago recorded. Native to the forests of southeastern China and Taiwan, they feed on low-growing vegetation, fruit and nuts and are predominantly solitary by nature. Muntjacs stand no more than 20 inches tall and can weigh up to 30 pounds, and they're often referred to as \"barking deer\" for the sharp, bark-like call they produce. Kya and the other muntjacs can be found at the Rosamund Gifford Zoo's Wildlife Trails across from white-lipped deer and adjacent to the red pandas. Kya is on exhibit with her mother, father and brother, Fang, who was born in 2013.\n\nThe zoo is also welcoming an adorable baby snow leopard, Asa. This is a very special addition considering there are less than 7,000 snow leopards left in the wild and only about 144 in zoos across the nation. Head on over to watch a hand feeding.\n\nBorn on Sept. 5 to first-time mom Grace and dad Travis at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, giraffe calf Jabari was named after the Swahili word for brave and strong. Since giraffes give birth standing up, newborns get an abrupt introduction to the world by dropping up to 6 feet to the ground. Jabari weighed in at about 140 pounds and was 6 feet tall when he was born. He joined half sibling Adia, who is 3 months old, in the African Savanna exhibit where they can both be seen now. The Zoo participates in the Masai giraffe Species Survival Plan of the AZA, working to successfully breed this species that is native to Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nRELATED: More baby zoo animals",

    "text": "Much of the oil measure approved Tuesday focuses on the relationship between the new council and Iraq\u2019s regions and provinces. The Kurdistan Regional Government, which consists of three provinces, has a system already in place for entering into contracts for oil field exploration and development and did not want a new system to upend its authority. Retaining some regional control over oil contracting is also vitally important to Iraq\u2019s Shiites, who plan to form a region in the south similar to Kurdistan.\n\nThe oil measure allows contracts to be reviewed by the new oil council, but sets limits on the council\u2019s latitude to reject contracts. The law also permits foreign participation in oil field development. Agreement on this law was first reached in February, but then the measure was sent to the Shura Council, a body which reviews laws to ensure that they are compatible with Iraq\u2019s constitution and with existing oil laws. The Kurdistan Regional Government said it had yet to review the final text and would withhold its endorsement until its experts had read it.\n\nPrime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki described the measure as \u201cthe most important legislation\u201d to reach Parliament and laid out a schedule for moving ahead on other measures intended to improve relations between Iraq\u2019s Shiite majority and Sunni Arabs.\n\nThe framework law, however, is only one part of the oil package. The second crucial element, the law establishing guidelines for dividing Iraq\u2019s oil revenue, has yet to be approved by the cabinet, but Mr. Maliki and his aides said they hoped that there would be progress on that soon.\n\nThe American Embassy welcomed the momentum, although it fell short of the larger package of oil legislation on which the United States Congress has demanded movement.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step in this Iraqi process,\u201d said Philip Reeker, spokesman for Ryan Crocker, the United States ambassador.\n\nAlthough the cabinet\u2019s approval is significant, only 24 of 37 cabinet members were present because the Sunni Arab ministers are boycotting cabinet meetings, as are the six ministers who represent the faction that supports the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr.\n\nRepresentatives of the Sunni bloc said they were not opposed to the law, but that there were a number of aspects of it that they wanted to discuss.\n\n\u201cWe are astonished at the government\u2019s rush to submit the law to Parliament,\u201d said Salim Abdullah, a member of the Sunni bloc, Tawafiq. \u201cWe will not be an obstacle in the road of the law but we have some comments and reservations,\u201d he said.\n\nComplicating matters is the fact that members of the Sunni bloc are boycotting Parliament and cabinet meetings to protest an arrest warrant against the culture minister and to insist on the reinstatement of the speaker, Mahmoud al-Mashadani, a Sunni Arab, who had been asked to step aside by a majority in Parliament.\n\nIf their boycott continues, it is likely that discussion and passage of the oil framework law will be protracted.\n\nThe car bomb on Tuesday evening exploded at the gate of a busy market in Shaab that has been attacked several times. The place has streets lined with flimsy wooden and plastic market stands where people can buy cheap fruits and vegetables, groceries and household goods.\n\nMarket stalls, stores and cars were set on fire, witnesses said. People screamed as they burned and local residents rushed to throw earth on flaming bodies to smother the fires.\n\nNajim al-Kaabi, a day worker in the market, was in a nearby Shiite mosque, or husseiniya, when the bomb exploded. \u201cWe saw fire everywhere, in the shops that sell birds,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw a lot of bodies, human flesh all over the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw the police loading the burnt bodies into the trucks and I recognized one of my neighbors; he owned a small shop, he burned to death in it. It was horrible, I cannot forget it,\u201d Mr. Kaabi said.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Amil neighborhood, once a mixed area, Sunni Arabs were fighting for survival. The Shiite militia linked to Mr. Sadr has been systematically taking ground, terrorizing and killing local Sunni Arabs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Interior Ministry commandos, who are believed to be predominantly Shiite, stopped a car with four guards for the Sunni Arab planning minister, Ali Baban. Mahdi militiamen indicated that they wanted to take the guards and the commandos allowed them to, according to two witnesses.\n\nSunni Arab neighbors were outraged. They marched to the gates of the local United States base on Tuesday to ask the Americans to interfere because the checkpoint is near the base. \u201cWe are going to stay here until they do something about this,\u201d said Abu Hassan, a neighborhood resident who was camped out in front of the American base.\n\nThe United States military had not verified this account as of late Tuesday, but it is well established that the area is at the heart of a sectarian battle on the west side of Baghdad.\n\nEighteen dead bodies were found around Baghdad on Tuesday, according to an Interior Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAn article on Wednesday about efforts by the Iraqi cabinet to complete work on an oil law misstated the formal name of the government in the Kurdish region, which has a system in place for entering into contracts for oil field exploration and development. It is the Kurdistan Regional Government, not the Kurdish Regional Government.",

    "text": "She will get to New Hampshire, whose political significance is well-known, late in the week. But this is not, she has insisted, a political campaign. Still, the trip has renewed speculation that she could be heading in that direction, though no one but Palin and her husband, Todd, may know the real answer.\n\nThose who have campaign experience say her un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox approach is a non-starter. Three senior Republican strategists dismissed the idea that the tour Palin and her family are on could be a prototype for a campaign. One called it \u201can ill-conceived\u201d venture, and another said that although it gives Palin publicity without real scrutiny, it would not work for a candidate.\n\nPalin wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. No one enjoys tweaking the politico-media establishment more than the former Alaska governor, who believes she has been scorned and ridiculed by that establishment throughout her political career. In that context, running for president would be the ultimate antiestablishment act by the nation\u2019s most unpredictable politician.\n\nOf course, no one knows whether the bus tour is designed to lead to a candidacy or is just another way for Palin to capitalize on her celebrity. She has played that card repeatedly, and with considerable success, to enhance her personal brand, if not her political standing.\n\nShe manages to keep speculation about a 2012 presidential run alive through the most slender of hints. She has indicated that a future tour may take her to Iowa. Don\u2019t be surprised if South Carolina pops up on her map at some point in coming weeks. Those stops alone would feed the story line that she might just possibly be thinking about considering whether to get serious about exploring a candidacy.\n\nIf nothing else, she has mastered the art of playing the media. She spent the holiday weekend in a game of cat-and-mouse with reporters, refusing to issue a schedule of her stops at historic sights. She spoke to reporters in Gettysburg on Monday night. She then ducked the media there Tuesday morning. She says she wants reporters to have to work a little to figure things out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I owe anything to the mainstream media,\u201d she told Greta Van Susteren of Fox News. \u201cI think it would be a mistake for me to become some kind of conventional politician.\u201d\n\nThe next stops on Palin\u2019s tour include the Statue of Liberty, any number of places in Boston and then New Hampshire \u2014 but just when and where and where else is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nBut on a weekend when other real or likely Republican candidates were campaigning, she still drew the most attention. Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty was in Iowa on Monday and Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.) was in New Hampshire. Palin overshadowed both, at least in media coverage. On Thursday, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney will formally announce his campaign. That will draw a crowd. Until then, Palin is taking up everyone\u2019s space.",

' \" That's what apparently sparked the FDA's April 13 warning letter, according to the various media accounts.\n\nAs for the details, Delta commented to Bloomberg News about the story on Tuesday, saying the jet in question had been cleaned and was \"returned to service within days\" of the incident, according to the news service.\n\nCNN says the contaminated areas were found in \"the ceiling panels of the plane's middle crossover galley, or directly over places where food and drinks are stored, according to the (FDA) letter.\"\n\nDelta spokeswoman Ashley Black tells Bloomberg the airline took the rodent case \"very seriously,\" adding the carrier fixed the problem by temporarily parking the jet and \"humanely catching the animal.\"\n\nShe declined to say what type of aircraft the incident occurred on, but did say that it was a plane used on international flights.\n\n\"We believe this was an isolated incident and we cooperated with the FDA immediately to resolve it earlier this year,\" Black tells Bloomberg. \"The health and safety of Delta's customers and employees are Delta's top priority.\"\n\nStill, CNN says the FDA's warning letter \"asks Delta to outline the specific steps it has taken to correct the violations, including an explanation of how it plans to prevent them from happening again.\" The airline has until April 28 to respond.\n\n\"We believe a recurrence is likely without adequate preventive measures in place,\" John Gridley, director of the FDA's Atlanta District Office, wrote in the letter to Delta, according to CNN.\n\nHowever, Chad Artimovich, president of pest-control company Atlanta Wildlife Solutions LLC, tells Bloomberg that food issues may not be the biggest fear.\n\n\"The real concern is if a rat started chewing on wires,\" he said, alluding to safety ramifications.\n\nPosted Apr 20 2011 3:46PM",

    "text": "For as long as many of us can remember, high-tech industries have flourished in the suburban office parks that are so ubiquitous in Silicon Valley, North Carolina's Research Triangle and other \"nerdistans.\" But in recent years, high-tech has been taking a decidedly urban turn.\n\nSilicon Valley remains the world's pre-eminent center of high-tech industry, of course. But even in the Valley, denser, more mixed-use and walkable places, like downtown Palo Alto, are becoming the preferred locations for start-ups and smaller firms. And many other start-ups\u2014Pinterest, Zynga, Yelp, Square and Salesforce.com, to name just a notable few\u2014are taking up residence in downtown San Francisco.\n\nNew York City's Silicon Alley is now home to more than 500 new start-up companies like Kickstarter and Tumblr. Here, Tumblr-founder David Karp at company headquarters in New York earlier this year.\n\nNew York City's Silicon Alley\u2014after a false start during the tech bubble of the late 1990s\u2014is now home to more than 500 new start-up companies like Kickstarter and Tumblr, not to mention the gigantic Google satellite in the old Port Authority Building on Eighth Avenue between 15th and 16th streets.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, London's once- derelict Shoreditch district\u2014now known as Tech City or Silicon Roundabout\u2014has been transformed into a thriving high-tech district housing 3,200 tech firms and 48,000 jobs, according to a recent report from the Centre for London.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Silicon Beach, a roughly three-mile strip between Santa Monica and Venice, has become a notable start-up hub, because its walkability and urban-like amenities make it the place where young techies prefer to live, work and play, according to L.A.-based venture capitalist Mark Suster.\n\nSeattle's South Lake Union District development, pioneered by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, is transforming a once moribund manufacturing area into a major center for new technology, with Amazon's new headquarters at its hub, as well as a number of biotechnology research centers.\n\nOut in the Nevada desert, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh is looking to remake downtown Las Vegas as a creative center, moving the company's headquarters to the old city hall and luring start-ups from California. \"When you're in a city,\" Mr. Hsieh told Fortune magazine, \"the bar or the restaurant becomes an extended conference room.\" Since the neighborhood lacked them, \"the idea went from 'let's build a campus' to 'let's build a city.' \"\n\n\"I love the idea of an urban corporate campus with all the energy and variety that provides,\" Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey tweeted last February, after opening his company's new headquarters in a formerly derelict Art Deco building in San Francisco's Mid-Market neighborhood.\n\nVenture capital icon Paul Graham notes that, for all its advantages and power, Silicon Valley has a great weakness. The high-tech \"paradise\" created in the 1950s and 1960s \"is now one giant parking lot,\" he writes. \"San Francisco and Berkeley are great, but they're 40 miles away. Silicon Valley proper is soul-crushing suburban sprawl. It has fabulous weather, which makes it significantly better than the soul-crushing sprawl of most other American cities. But a competitor that managed to avoid sprawl would have real leverage.\"\n\nStill, escaping sprawl is only part of the explanation. There are also the distinct lifestyle advantages of setting up shop in the hurly-burly of real urban districts. Compared with previous generations, today's younger techies are less interested in owning cars and big houses. They prefer to live in central locations, where they can rent an apartment and use transit or walk or bike to work, and where there are plenty of nearby options for socializing during nonwork hours.\n\n\"It's not that young people wanted to live in Mountain View in the past,\" Mr. Suster blogged. \"In fact, so many did not that companies like Google & Yahoo had free buses with Wi-Fi from San Francisco to their Palo Alto and Sunnyvale headquarters.\"\n\nOr, as one high-tech entrepreneur told the authors of the Centre for London report: \"We moved here out of pressure from the [software] developers to move somewhere better. And by better, I think they mean somewhere which has lots of bars and lots of places you can eat.\"\n\nBut it goes well beyond the young and trendy. With all their cultural and intellectual amenities, urban centers are also the preferred locales for many leading scientists and engineers. Microsoft opened its new research lab in New York City last May because the top scientists it wanted to bring on board preferred to stay in the city.\n\nAn even bigger part of the story is rooted in the changing nature of technology itself. A generation or so ago, the fastest-growing high-tech companies were more like factories. They developed proprietary software systems, designed and manufactured chips, built computers and created the infrastructure that made the Internet possible. Whether it was Microsoft or Apple, they deployed big engineering teams\u2014and they needed big suburban campuses to house them.\n\nThe changing nature of technology\u2014cloud-based applications in particular\u2014enable new start-ups to succeed more quickly, with smaller teams and much smaller footprints.\n\nThe speed of technology has also accelerated. The companies that succeed are the ones that stay in the closest contact with their end-users and first adopters, as MIT's Eric Von Hippel has shown. When a company is located in a city, many of those end-users can be found right on its doorstep.\n\nAt the same time, high-tech products and industries are more multidisciplinary than they used to be. Success often requires excellence in more than one field of technology and in other lines of business. East London's tech scene is led not by tech firms per se but by \"digital creative\" companies that combine computer technology with music, art and narrative\u2014and musicians, artists and writers cluster in cities.\n\nSoftware for social media and apps requires intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces that seamlessly convey information. Design is central to successful new hardware products as well, the most obvious examples being Apple's iPads and iPhones. Design talent is overwhelmingly concentrated in big cities, with their leading design schools and multiple industries that draw upon such skills.\n\nOther areas of high-tech are premised less on breakthrough innovations and more on the application of technology to massive new markets in retailing, advertising, media, financial services, education, publishing, communications, fashion and music. Big cities like New York and London are where those industries\u2014and the talent that powers them\u2014are most concentrated.\n\nCities are central to innovation and new technology. They act as giant petri dishes, where creative types and entrepreneurs rub up against each other, combining and recombining to spark new ideas, new inventions, new businesses and new industries.\n\nA version of this article appeared September 1, 2012, on page C3 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: The Joys of Urban Tech.",

    "text": "Most people who choose bottled water over tap do so because they prefer the taste, and they pick their brands on the basis of taste and budget. However, different springs may bring different health benefits \u2013 though admittedly these are likely to be small.\n\n\"Generally, mineral water is no better for you than tap water, but if you have a low dietary intake of certain minerals, drinking a water with high levels would be helpful,\" says GP Amanda Kirby, a member of the Expert Group on Hydration. \"However, waters with high mineral levels tend to have a strong taste which some people do not like, and the important thing is that people should be encouraged to drink.\"\n\nBabies and small children, whose kidneys are not fully developed, should only be given still bottled waters with a low mineral content, which should be boiled for drinking by infants of six months and under.\n\nSparkling water gained a bad reputation a few years back when it was said to increase cellulite, and leach minerals \u2013 especially calcium \u2013 from the bones. Neither rumour turned out to be true. \"Some people with digestive problems find fizzy water helpful, but others say it makes them feel bloated,\" says Jo Jacobius of the Natural Mineral Water Information Service.\n\n\"When carbonated drinks are consumed, the carbon dioxide gas is released and can act to fill the stomach, which in turn sends signals to the brain indicating that the stomach is full. For this reason, some professional slimmers, including jockeys, find sparkling water of help in their diet plan.\" If you are trying to keep yourself hydrated \u2013 in a hot climate or during a plane journey \u2013 stick to still water, which is easier to drink in large quantities.\n\nThose who prefer tap water have no choice about their beverage, but may like to know what is in it. The high mineral hard water areas tend to be in the South and East of England, while Wales, the South-West, the North and North-West have soft water. This may affect more than the taste, the state of your kettle and how much soap you need to make a lather.\n\nAccording to the researchers from Geographical Survey of Finland, men who have had a heart attack are less likely to have another if they live in a hard water area. Researchers studied measurements of calcium, magnesium, fluoride, iron, copper, zinc, nitrate and aluminium. Fluoride levels appeared to be very protective, but iron and copper had the opposite effect.\n\nAccording to nutritionist Fiona Hunter, \"waters with a high calcium content do contribute to calcium intake, which can be important for people who do not eat dairy products\".\n\nThis could be significant in a soft-water area with little calcium in the tap water. In such areas, drinking two litres of tap water a day might give you just 30mg of calcium (the recommended daily allowance is 800mg): by contrast, the same consumption in a hard-water area could give you 240mg. High- calcium mineral waters include Badoit (190mg per litre), Perrier (150mg), Ashe Park (122mg) and Vittel (91mg).\n\nThis mineral is also important for bones and teeth, as well as heart and cellular health. Researchers at Wageningen Agricultural University in the Netherlands found that magnesium was more readily absorbed through water than from foods. Tap-water magnesium levels are generally low. The highest bottled-water magnesium levels are found in Badoit (85mg), Abbey Well (36mg) and Vittel (20mg).\n\nThose on low-sodium diets should read mineral-water labels carefully. Badoit (150mg) and Abbey Well (45mg) have relatively high sodium levels, while those with low levels include Spa Reine (3mg), Evian (5mg) and Brecon Carreg and Highland Spring (both 6mg).\n\nAccording to research at the Free University of Berlin, mineral water low in salt but rich in sodium bicarbonate helped lower blood pressure in older people. Of the very low-salt waters, Evian and Highland Spring have the highest bicarbonate levels.",

It would have made them understand what happens to those who stand in the Mafia\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nThere was no independent verification of the mob killer\u2019s story, although there was reportedly an open investigation 24 years after the supposed plot.\n\nAvola became a cooperating witness and will be out of prison in 2019 in return for his information.\n\nThere was no response Friday from Gov.

As she turned the machine on, she thought something had malfunctioned.\n\n\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t listening right or something,\u201d Ives, a nurse in London, told ABCNews.com. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe his [heart] rate could be that fast.\u201d\n\nIves\u2019 son had a heart rate of about 300 beats per minute, nearly double the normal 160.\n\nAfter doctors were alerted to the baby\u2019s elevated heart rate, Ives delivered her son, Edward Ives, five weeks early via emergency cesarean at the University College London Hospital.\n\nEdward Ives was born with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and was given a five percent chance of survival. SVT is caused by improper electrical impulses in the heart that leads to an irregular rapid heartbeat heart, which then can lead to heart failure or affect internal organs. When the heart beats too quickly, it can\u2019t fill up properly and then distribute blood to vital organs correctly.\n\n\u201cI just thought he was going to die,\u201d said Ives.\n\nA few hours after Edward was born, his heart started to race again. Doctors attempted to reset his heart rate by shocking his heart and giving him different medications, but when that failed they were left without many options except one they had never tried for SVT: They would lower Edward\u2019s body temperature to protect his vital organs and slow his heart rate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d gone through all the usual maneuvers that usually work in babies, giving drugs \u2026 trying to shock the heart, the baby and get [a healthy heart rate back],\u201d said Dr. Nicola Robertson, who works in the neonatal unit at the University College London Hospital.\n\nOver a period of hours the doctors used a cold gel blanket to lower Edward\u2019s body temperature to approximately 91 degrees, which both protected his organs and slowed the electrical circuit in his heart. Unfortunately, over the next day, as Edward was warmed up, his heart began to race again. So the team again cooled his body temperature, three days after they had initially lowered it.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the worst nights,\u201d recalled Ives. \u201dI asked one of the nurses if he was going to die and she said he might.\u201d\n\nIves was sent out of the room when the doctors again attempted to slow his heart rate down by not only cooling but administering medication. Eventually they came to tell her that his heart rate had slowed, although he would again need to be warmed up to see if his heart rate was stable.\n\n\u201cIt was really strange highs and lows because he was doing extremely poorly,\u201d said Ives. \u201cBut, oh, thank God! It worked.\u201d\n\nDoctors then began the slow process of warming Edward, this time going at a slower rate as they carefully raised his temperature only half a degree every 12 hours. This time his heart rate remained stable.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 10 days after giving birth that Claire Ives was able to hold her son. A month later she and her husband, Phillip Ives, were able to bring Edward home to join his two older siblings.\n\nNow a healthy six-month old, Edward has an excellent prognosis and is unlikely to need further hospitalizations for SVT although he is being closely monitored to see if the irregular heartbeat returns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s made me appreciate all the small things about my children,\u201d said Claire Ives, who is planning to run a half-marathon to raise awareness about neonatal SVT. \u201dIt\u2019s the best thing ever to bring him home.\u201d",

Analysts said the imports data could lead to further policy easing from the Chinese government in coming months.\n\nThose hopes boosted U.S. shares, while data showing Germany saw imports and exports hit record highs in value terms in July underpinned gains in European stocks. Germany's benchmark DAX share index was last up nearly 2 percent.\n\nA late bounce in Chinese stocks, which pushed the Shanghai Composite Index up 2.9 percent after earlier declines, also also supported European shares.\n\n\"With volatility having receded somewhat during the past few days it appears that investors have been reassessing the potential negative fallout from the slowdown in China,\" said Markus Huber, a senior analyst at Peregrine & Black.\n\nBrent crude rose on data showing the euro zone's economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, with gross domestic product up 1.5 percent year-on-year versus a previous reading of 1.2 percent.\n\nBrent prices were also helped by data showing China crude oil imports rose 5.6 percent in August from a year earlier.\n\nBrent crude was last up $1.01, or 2.12 percent, at $48.64 a barrel. U.S. crude, meanwhile, was down 68 cents, or 1.48 percent, at $45.37 per barrel.\n\nMSCI's all-country world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was last up 4.62 points or 1.2 percent, at 389.27.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was last up 241.25 points, or 1.5 percent, to 16,343.63.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 76.20 points, or 1.63 percent, at 4,760.12.\n\nEurope's FTSEurofirst 300 index of top regional shares was up 1.23 percent, at 1,416.55.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields rose ahead of the U.S. Treasury's scheduled sale of $24 billion in three-year notes later on Tuesday. Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 15/32 in price to yield 2.18 percent, from a yield of 2.13 percent late Friday.\n\nThe renewed risk appetite led the dollar to gain against the safe-haven yen, but the greenback still inched lower against the euro. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.26 percent .\n\n\"The market is trading more risk-on across the board,\" said BNP Paribas FX strategist Sam Lynton-Brown in London.\n\nGold firmed but remained close to 2-1/2 week lows as uncertainty over the timing of the U.S interest rate hike persisted.

    "text": "The rubber trade collapsed, and fortunes here and downriver in the Brazilian city of Manaus vanished. Some Jewish immigrants perished young, succumbing to diseases like cholera. A few stayed, marrying local women and raising families. Others returned home, leaving behind descendants who clung to a belief that they were Jews.\n\n\u201cIt was astounding to discover that in Iquitos there existed this group of people who were desperate to reconnect to their roots and re-establish ties to the broader Jewish world,\u201d said Lorry Salcedo Mitrani, the director of a new documentary, \u201cThe Fire Within,\u201d about the Jews of the Peruvian Amazon.\n\nScholars compare the Jews here with groups like the Hispanic crypto-Jews of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, the Lemba of southern Africa or the Bene Israel of India, who in varying ways have sought to reclaim a Jewish identity that had seemingly been weakened through time.\n\n\u201cWe were isolated for so many decades, living on the jungle\u2019s edge in a Catholic society without rabbis or a synagogue, in which all we had were some vague notions of what it meant to be Jewish,\u201d Mr. Re\u00e1tegui Levy said.\n\n\u201cBut when I was a child, my mother told me something that forever burned into my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cShe told me, \u2018You are a Jew, and you are never to forget that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIquitos lies four degrees south of the Equator, reachable only by boat or plane. Isolation, intermarriage and assimilation nearly wiped out the vestiges of Judaism here. Storefronts chiseled with Jewish surnames like Foinquinos and Cohen, and a cemetery ravaged by vandals, served as some of the few reminders of the community that once thrived here.\n\nBut by the end of the 1990s, some of these descendants, including Mr. Re\u00e1tegui Levy, were brought together by V\u00edctor Edery, a patriarchal figure who organized religious ceremonies in his own home, keeping a few customs alive even if it was done by blending Jewish and Christian beliefs.\n\nStill, the existence of the Jews of Iquitos posed some philosophical challenges to some Jews elsewhere. Since nearly all the Jews who originally settled here were men, their descendants could not attest to having Jewish mothers, ruling them out as being Jewish according to strict interpretations of Jewish law.\n\nMoreover, the Jewish community of about 3,000 people in Lima, the capital, largely preferred to ignore the Jews of Iquitos, some scholars say, in part because of the thorny issues that the Jews here posed about race and origins. This is, after all, a country where a small light-skinned elite still wields considerable economic and political power \u2014 and Lima\u2019s Jews are often seen as an elite within that elite.\n\n\u201cThe notion of a Jew who looks like an Indian and lives in a poor house in a small city in the middle of the jungle is, at best, an exotic footnote to the official history of Peru\u2019s Jewry as Lima sees it,\u201d said Ariel Segal, a Venezuelan-born Israeli historian whose arrival here in the 1990s to study the community also helped serve as a catalyst for the Iquitos Jews to organize.\n\nBy the start of this decade, the Jews here were gathering to observe Shabbat each Friday and during the High Holy Days at the home of the patriarch, Mr. Edery. After he died, they met on Pr\u00f3spero Street at the home of Jorge Abramovitz, 60, whose father, a Polish Jew, moved here long after the collapse of the rubber boom.\n\nWhile they lacked a rabbi, they conducted services in Hebrew they learned from cassette tapes. They cleaned their cemetery and began burying their dead there again. They persisted in their campaign to be recognized as Jews and to be allowed to emigrate to Israel.\n\nFinally, they persuaded Guillermo Bronstein, the chief rabbi of Lima\u2019s largest Ashkenazi synagogue, to oversee two large conversions, easing the way for hundreds to move to Israel. The exodus included nearly the entire Levy clan, descended from Joseph Levy, an adventurer who put down stakes here in the 19th century.\n\nMr. Re\u00e1tegui Levy, the oil field inspector, moved in 2005 with his wife and six children to Ramla, a dusty city southeast of Tel Aviv. But despite dreaming for decades of such a move, he said he had trouble adjusting to Israeli life.\n\nHe said he missed his house with cacao and passion fruit trees, and the status of being a manager at PetroPer\u00fa. He murmured something, just audible over the din of this city\u2019s thousands of motorcycle rickshaws, about losing the spark of love with his wife.\n\nSo, unlike nearly all the Iquite\u00f1os who moved to Israel, Mr. Re\u00e1tegui Levy moved back, alone.\n\nHe still attends Shabbat at Mr. Abramovitz\u2019s home each week, along with 40 or so other regulars who dream of formally converting and moving to Israel. While their numbers have dwindled, he encourages them and regales them with tales of fertile land in the Golan Heights and the bravery of his eldest son, Uri, who is in the Israeli Army.\n\nBut something keeps Mr. Re\u00e1tegui Levy here in Iquitos, the same decaying jungle city that attracted his great-grandfather from Tangier so many decades ago. \u201cMy family, my heart and soul, all that I hold dear are in Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I am back here for a reason.\u201d\n\nThe Iquitos Journal article on Monday, about the Jews of Iquitos, Peru, a decaying Amazon jungle city that thrived as a 19th century trading post before the decline of the rubber business, referred incorrectly to the location of Manaus, Brazil, another Amazon jungle city that suffered when the rubber business weakened. It is downriver from Iquitos, not upriver.",

You\u2019re in good company.\n\nShortly after the royal wedding Twitter handles were created for the princess\u2019 royal sister Pippa\u2019s fantastic backside. There was @Pippasbackside and @pippasass, the latter of which gained more than 3,000 followers. It also spawned its own tribute website.\n\nKim Kardashian\u2019s ample asset has long had its own Twitter handles. @KimsAss has more than 7,000 Twitter followers and tweets about its troubles getting into an itty bitty bikini bottom and the perils of Kardashian eating too many carbs.\n\nIf you think 7,000 followers is on the feeble side, think about this: There have only been five tweets from the account.\n\nRihanna\u2019s legs have their own Twitter too (@Rihannaslegs) and in a disturbing turn, so do R&B singer Keri Hilson\u2019s feet (@KeriHilson_feet).\n\nLady body parts seem to do much better than their male counterparts. A Twitter devoted to Bradley Cooper\u2019s mustache, @CoopersMustache only has 449 followers. The Twitter handle @Jay_Lenos_Chin, whose tagline is \u201cLooking for other celebrity body parts to interview\u201d has only 29 followers.\n\nFor a brief period prior to his run for the Republican presidential nomination Texas governor Rick Perry\u2019s hair got its own Twitter account at the handle @govPerryshair which provided a daily update on the politician\u2019s perfectly groomed coif as well as comparisons to other political follicles. Still the Texan governor\u2019s hair never reached 1,000 followers.\n\nAnd despite the intense fervor over teen pop star Justin Bieber on the Internet, particularly on Twitter (there are more than 5,000 fan handles for Bieber on the site), Bieber\u2019s famous hairstyle @Bieber_hair has less than 1,000 followers.\n\nThe male celebrity body part with the most Twitter followers just might be 50 Cent\u2019s teeth (@50CentsTeeth) with 3,920 followers.\n\nOn twitter's bloggy cousing Tumblr, however, no celebrity body part is as popular as Ryan Gosling's abs. There are more than thirty Tumblr accounts dedicated to the \u201cCrazy, Stupid, Love\u201d star's perfectly cut abdomen, among them \u201cFeminist Ryan Gosling\u201d which pair typically topless pictures of the actor with feminist theory flashcards and \u201cBiostatistics Ryan Gosling\u201d which does the same with esoteric stat language.\n\nOf course, who wouldn\u2019t be interested in Chebvychev\u2019s inequality when it comes attached to Gosling's pecs.",

Under enormous pressure, the political cracks were widening and the next few days were likely to be crucial. The Communist Party Central Committee scheduled an emergency meeting for today, a general strike was planned for Tuesday, Warsaw Pact military maneuvers inside and adjoining Poland were extended indefinitely and shoppers went on a panic-buying binge. Nationwide food rationing will begin on Wednesday.\n\n''This time we have one leg hanging over the precipice,'' admitted Lech Walesa. Millions of his Solidarity union followers staged a disciplined, four-hour ''warning'' strike Friday, the largest organized protest since Poland became Communist 36 years ago.\n\nUnion leaders met with Government officials after the protest Friday for three hours, sat down for another three hours yesterday and then adjourned until tomorrow. No breakthrough was achieved though Solidarity sources said the Government was rewriting a report on the incident that provoked the crisis - the March 19 beating of union activists in Bydgoszcz - to reflect union views.\n\n''It is not an impasse,'' said Solidarity's second-in-command, Andrzej Gwiazda. ''I think that Solidarity is also ready for compromise and is aware of the importance of the situation,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the chief Government negotiator.\n\nLeaders on both sides met with Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski. The Vatican published a letter from Pope John Paul II to the Polish primate stressing the ''common opinion of nations who love peace'' that the Poles had an ''undeniable right to resolve their problems by themselves.''\n\nHopes for compromise were swiftly dimmed, however, by Moscow. The official Tass press agency, in a statement read over Soviet television last night, declared flatly that Solidarity -which has insisted that Government officials implicated in the Bydgoszcz beatings be fired - was making ''unacceptable'' political demands. It repeated accusations that Polish dissidents had taken control of Solidarity and were using the union for political ends.\n\nThe categorical statement could be read as a justification for Soviet intervention. It seemed timed to strengthen hard-liners before today's crucial meeting of the Polish party Central Committee. Earlier, Tass condemned Solidarity's ''anti-Socialist, antipeople'' policies, adding that Polish dissidents had created ''chaos and anarchy.'' The East German news agency, more virulently, said Solidarity was printing threats to kill party leaders.\n\nIf the general strike takes place, Western diplomats in Warsaw said the Government may declare a state of emergency and use the army to keep services running, risking civil conflict.\n\nPresident Reagan said the situation was ''very serious, very tense.'' Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. said hard-liners were regaining control, in a ''very dangerous, very bad'' split in the Polish party. If the Russians invade, detente would crumble; so would prospects for further credits, trade and arms control talks, Washington and its European allies warned.\n\nBut in Warsaw, union leader Walesa told his followers: ''Nobody will make us work from the barrel of a gun.''",

    "text": "Philip B. Corbett is the associate masthead editor for standards.\n\nAs overseer of The Times\u2019s newsroom style manual, I heard from a number of people after this opening passage appeared in a recent Metro article:\n\n\u201cAre we anarchist?\u201d Senia Hardwick asked. \u201cTechnically, yes.\u201d Mx. Hardwick, 27, who prefers not to be assigned a gender \u2014 and also insists on the gender-neutral Mx. in place of Ms. or Mr. \u2014 is a staff member at Bluestockings, a bookshop and activist center at 172 Allen Street on the Lower East Side. Mx. Hardwick was explaining that the ethos of Bluestockings, which is run by a collective of volunteers, is difficult to classify. But if you must: \u201cAnarchist is O.K.\u201d\n\nPeople inside and outside the newsroom wondered if \u201cMx.\u201d \u2014 an unfamiliar term to many \u2014 had suddenly taken its place alongside \u201cMr.\u201d and \u201cMs.\u201d in our stylebook\u2019s entry on courtesy titles.\n\nThe short answer is no. Or not yet. Or perhaps, ask me again in a while. Things are changing fast in this area.\n\n\u201cMx.,\u201d pronounced \u201cmix,\u201d is a coinage preferred by some transgender people who do not identify as either male or female and so do not want to use \u201cMr.\u201d or \u201cMs.\u201d\n\nLike \u201cMs.\u201d \u2014 and unlike the far older and more traditional \u201cMr.\u201d and \u201cMrs.\u201d \u2014 \u201cMx.\u201d isn\u2019t an abbreviation of an existing English word, though the echo of the word \u201cmix\u201d seems rather elegant in the context.\n\nOur guidelines on transgender references have long advised Times writers to use the names, pronouns and courtesy titles preferred by the subject. But these guidelines are based on the assumption that people would identify as either male or female, which makes it easy: Caitlyn Jenner, Ms. Jenner, she. What happens when people don\u2019t identify as either male or female? This is still a relatively rare situation in news articles, but it seems to be arising more often.\n\nUsage is unsettled and evolving. \u201cMx.\u201d has gained some acceptance, but it remains unfamiliar to many readers. (Of course, most news organizations don\u2019t use courtesy titles, which allows them to avoid that issue.)\n\nEven more daunting is the problem of pronouns. Some people advocate \u201cthey\u201d as a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to a single individual, while others have suggested invented alternatives like \u201cze\u201d or \u201cxe.\u201d\n\nIn this as in other areas of language and usage, The Times is not looking to lead the way, set the rules or break new ground. Our hope is to reflect accepted, standard usage among educated readers.\n\nAt a time when usage is unsettled or shifting, that puts us in an awkward holding pattern. A number of outside media writers have asked me some version of \u201cWhat is The Times\u2019s policy/rule/decision on Mx., or on nongendered pronouns?\u201d The answer, for now, is that we don\u2019t have a rule.\n\nOur style guideline, assuming we eventually adopt one, will try to reflect the language that our readers and society at large are already using \u2014 not to dictate what The Times thinks people should do.\n\nIn the meantime, though, Times editors and writers want to know what to do about this person, in this article, right now. We\u2019ve handled the small number of examples so far case by case. There are two main goals: to be respectful to those we write about, and to be clear to our readers and avoid distracting them from the main point of an article.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s easy enough to avoid a second reference altogether, so no courtesy title or pronoun is needed. In some cases it\u2019s feasible to use someone\u2019s full name more than once \u2014 or, in the case of a younger person, to use the given name for subsequent references. Sometimes it may be less distracting to use the surname alone, as we routinely do in magazine articles, sports coverage and elsewhere.\n\nOn the few occasions when we\u2019ve used \u201cMx.,\u201d we have always explained its usage. We have avoided nontraditional pronouns, which are likely to be even more confusing or distracting \u2014 though writing an article without pronouns is a big challenge, and not practical in all cases.\n\nConsistency is an important goal in style guidelines. It\u2019s helpful to readers and is crucial to writers and editors who can\u2019t reinvent the wheel on deadline. But in a fast-changing area like this, I think we can live with some inconsistency for the time being. We should decide what works best in each case \u2014 keeping in mind our responsibilities to readers and to those we write about \u2014 while language conventions evolve to keep up.",

    "text": "Editor's note: David Rothkopf writes regularly for CNN.com. He is CEO and editor-at-large of the FP Group, publishers of Foreign Policy magazine, and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n(CNN) -- Any great speech about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process should leave everyone feeling a bit uncomfortable. Given that all involved have contributed to the troubled situation on the ground, all must challenge themselves to create the changes that are necessary.\n\nBy this measure and virtually any other fair metric, President Barack Obama's address to Israeli students Thursday was a great speech. Boldly, pointedly and deftly, he provided a virtuoso display of political leadership and international statesmanship.\n\nIt stands as a companion piece to his great speech in Egypt early in his first term about America and the Arab world. And his great speech in the Czech Republic about nuclear disarmament. And his great Nobel Prize acceptance speech. And his many other great addresses. And like each of those resonant, masterful moments, the measure of the remarks will be in the follow-up, in the change they actually produce.\n\n5 things to know about Obama's first presidential visit to Israel\n\nIt is, after all, easier to be a speechmaker than a peacemaker. And in the wake of Obama's energizing address, he must now face greatly raised hopes that he will follow up on his words more successfully than he has the Cairo or Prague remarks. As Brookings Institution analyst and longtime U.S. diplomat Martin Indyk noted on CNN afterward, the president has now \"raised expectations sky-high that he himself is going to work to make peace possible.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that happens, but for a moment it is worth considering why the speech was so effective and important. Let's start by counting the people the president made uncomfortable.\n\nWe must begin with Obama's host for this visit to Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Surely, Netanyahu must have been pleased with the repeated and persuasive statements from Obama since his arrival in Israel that he and the United States remain committed to a special relationship with Israel and to helping ensure Israeli survival. This was precisely the kind of affirmation that the Israelis hoped for from this trip, salve to the wounds -- many Netanyahu brought on himself -- acquired in the run-up to last fall's presidential elections.\n\nBut of all the slights and bumps of the past months, the president's remarks -- in a sly but unmistakable way -- delivered the toughest blow to date to Netanyahu despite their powerful pro-Israeli rhetoric and images. Because Obama sent a message to Netanyahu that if need be he would go over his head to the Israeli people.\n\nObama, Netanyahu agree on preventing nuclear-armed Iran\n\nTo receive this message, Obama picked a young audience that he knew represented a different portion of Israel's vibrant polity, and he had them cheering and applauding, not just at the expressions of friendship, but at tough remarks about how unconstructive Netanyahu's settlement policies have been and how vital it is to establish a safe, prospering state for the Palestinians.\n\nBy the end, despite efforts to put an enthusiastic face on the event, Netanyahu must have been grateful there have been no Israeli politicians offering an alternative vision as clear as Obama's. Had there been, Netanyahu might have been working Thursday's speech as a commentator on Fox News.\n\nIndeed, Obama's remarks about how all must share the aspirations of Palestinian children must have resonated particularly well with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. But because this was a good and thus fair speech on the issue of peace, the president likely also made Abbas a bit uneasy with the forcefulness of his commitment to Israel's existence as a Jewish state, a commitment that cuts directly to an issue on which even the most constructive members of the Palestinian leadership have been reluctant to show flexibility.\n\nAbbas, however, was certainly nowhere nearly as directly affronted as the Hamas leaders in Gaza, whom the president unceremoniously slammed for their rocket attacks and for their inattentiveness to the needs of the Palestinian people entrusted into their care. Further, of course, in calling out the terrorist nature of Hezbollah, the president sent yet another message concerning his willingness to confront that organization's sponsors in Tehran.\n\nIn fact, it has seemed frequently throughout this trip that it has been more about standing together with Israel on Iran, toughening the approach to Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria and working to support Jordan than it has been about the Israelis and the Palestinians.\n\nJohn King: Walking through Ramallah and Gaza, political differences become real\n\nBut even on this last point, the speech again succeeded in making another group uncomfortable. Because in the end, it was the most potent speech an American president has ever given in Israel about the peace process, the most personal statement of commitment to it. And therefore it must have made very uncomfortable the small group of American diplomats and national security specialists who are going to have to follow through and try to live up to its promise with their actions.\n\nIn the end, Obama must make himself central to this process, actively and continuously, or the hopes it has raised will once again be cruelly deflated.\n\nOn the other hand, were he to follow through on this and help advance peace through the establishment of an independent Palestinian state that agreed to the secure existence of Israel, he would also be doing much to live up to the promise of his other earlier addresses. Like those calling for better relations with the Islamic world in Cairo and advancing the cause of peace in Prague and in Oslo.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.",

    "text": "Zach Britton has thrown 14 scoreless innings, nine of them in major league games, this spring.\n\nWhen the Orioles are discussed as an improved team this season, the talk typically turns to pitchers Chris Tillman, 25, Brian Matusz, 24, Brad Bergesen, 25, and Jake Arrieta, 25. All of them threw at least 170 innings last season, putting them on track for the possibility of a breakout season with no workload restrictions. They are only just now entering their prime years.\n\nLeft unspoken, though, is that the potential ace of this emerging staff has yet to make his major league debut. Lefthander Zach Britton, 23, quietly has become the talk of camp -- especially among the scouts who have watched him pitch.\n\n\"He's probably the best arm they have,\" said one scout. \"The way he's throwing the ball there's no way they have five starters better than him. He's been one of the best arms I've seen this spring. He really should make the team, but there's no way they're going to do that because of the Super Two thing.\"\n\nBy keeping Britton in the minors until about the last week of May, the Orioles can not only forestall free agency by a year but also hold Britton to three arbitration-eligible years instead of four. Baltimore used a similarly timed callup for catcher Matt Wieters in what is a common practice around baseball. (Wieters, the Nationals' Stephen Strasburg, the Marlins' Mike Stanton, the Indians' Carlos Santana, the Pirates' Andrew McCutchen, the White Sox' Gordon Beckham and the Braves' Tommy Hanson are just a few of the players who, coincidentally or not, were called up between May 29 and June 11 the past two years.)\n\nBritton is a rare bird, indeed, around baseball: Go ahead and try to name other lefthanded starters who throw 94 mph at the knees with movement. After David Price, what other power lefties are out there?\n\nBritton has thrown 14 scoreless innings this spring (five of them in a minor league game). Major league hitters have a hard time lifting his pitches, let alone squaring them up. He has allowed just one extra base hit, a double, and obtained 18 of his 27 outs on the ground against major leaguers. The lefty looks like a true success story of the development plan president Andy MacPhail emphasized when he was hired in 2007. (Britton was drafted in 2006.) Britton has been allowed to make more than 100 starts and throw more than 500 innings in the minors, standards that used to be commonplace before good arms were rushed into bullpen jobs in the big leagues.\n\nThis is turning out to be a difficult spring for Milwaukee, with catcher Jonathan Lucroy (finger) and righthanded pitchers Zack Greinke (basketball injury; rib), Mark Rogers (shoulder) and now Shaun Marcum (shoulder) all requiring medical attention. The Brewers must hope that the stiffness that knocked Marcum from his start Thursday is not a major issue, but something typical of the traditional mid-March \"dead arm\" period that pitchers face.\n\nWhen I spoke with Marcum earlier this spring he told me he used to throw as hard as 94 mph, but lost velocity by relying on his cutter. He said he wanted to at least get back into the low 90s by ramping up his long toss program this spring.\n\nWhen healthy, Marcum, 29, is one of the most rare pitchers in baseball: a young righthanded starter who is a successful without velocity. Marcum (87.1 mph) had the ninth lowest average fastball velocity last year among qualified starters, according to Fangraphs.com.\n\nIn fact, among the list of the 17 starters with an average fastball velocity no better than 89 mph, only two of them were righthanded and younger than 31: Marcum and Doug Fister, who was 6-14 for Seattle.\n\nMarcum put up a 13-8 season for Toronto, posting a 3.64 ERA over 195 1/3 innings -- a stupendous season in the AL East. Over the past two years, only four other AL East pitchers managed an ERA that low while pitching that many innings: David Price, Roy Halladay, CC Sabathia and Jon Lester. And Marcum did it without anything close to the velocity of those star pitchers.\n\nHouston first baseman Brett Wallace turns 25 this season, and for a guy who was with four organizations in 12 months when he debuted with the Astros last year, he finally appears to have some security. Now all he has to do is hit the way scouts and each of his organizations expected.\n\nLast week a Houston source said, \"Everything tells you he should hit. He was Pac-10 player of the year [at Arizona State] twice -- on the same team as Ike Davis. He was involved in trades for Matt Holliday, Roy Halladay and Roy Oswalt. So come on, there has to be something there, right? The problem for us is, we haven't seen it yet. We just haven't seen it.\"\n\nThat was right before Wallace unloaded four hits, including a grand slam, against Baltimore last week. A career .308 hitter in the minors, Wallace hit .222 with almost no power in 51 games for the Astros last season. But this spring he is hitting at a .350 clip and taking ownership of the first-base job.",

They must take personal responsibility.\n\n\"Huge damage has been done because millions of people have lost their faith in VW. We are surely going to have a lot of people suing for damages,\" Lies, also economy minister of the northwestern German state of Lower Saxony, told the BBC.\n\nSeveral countries, including Germany itself, have launched probes into the scandal and German prosecutors have also launched an inquiry against the 68-year-old Winterkorn.\n\nVW's finance chief Hans-Dieter Poetsch, who has been tipped to take over as supervisory board chief, could also find himself in the firing line, given his close relationship with Winterkorn and his key role on VW's executive board.\n\nLegal probes are under way not only in Germany, but also elsewhere, to find out who knew what and when.\n\nThe suspect diesel engines went on sale in 2009.\n\n\"That means that the pollution-cheating software must have been under discussion within the company as early as 2007 and 2008,\" the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung wrote.\n\nWinterkorn took the driving seat in VW in 2007. His predecessor, Bernd Pischetsrieder, and the former head of the Volkswagen brand issued statements via their lawyers on Tuesday evening denying they knew anything about the manipulation.\n\nVolkswagen, the world's biggest car-maker by sales, has admitted that up to 11 million diesel cars worldwide are fitted with devices that can switch on pollution controls when they detect the car is undergoing testing.\n\nThey then switch off the controls when the car is on the road, allowing it to spew out harmful levels of emissions.\n\nThe German government has given VW until October 7 to explain how it will resolve the scandal.\n\nThe Federal Transport Authority KBA threatened to withdraw road approval for VW models in Germany if the car-maker did not come up with the recall plan by then.\n\nOn Tuesday, the car-maker said owners of the affected cars would be notified \"in the next weeks and months\", adding that \"all the brands concerned are going to create internet pages where clients will be able to follow developments\".\n\nThe British arm of Volkswagen said on Wednesday it would recall and fix nearly 1.2 million vehicles affected by the emissions cheating scandal.\n\nLawsuits, including class-action litigation, are also being filed in the US.\n\nVW has already said it will set aside 6.5 billion euros in provisions in the third quarter, but analysts suggest one to three billion euros more could be needed.\n\nOn top of that, VW also faces onerous regulatory fines, including up to $US18 billion ($A25.75 billion) in the US, and the fallout on customer purchases cannot yet be estimated.\n\nVolkswagen owners in South Korea are following their US counterparts in suing the company.\n\nSeoul-based Barun Law said it had filed two complaints with the court on Wednesday morning, claiming the owners were defrauded when they purchased their vehicles.\n\nDo you have any news photos or videos?",

    "text": "The sound of one person clapping shatters the silence in the rehearsal space.\n\n\"Thank you,\" says Presley, her looks so reminiscent of her father's that if she added \"very much,\" you'd swear the ghost of Elvis had entered the building. \"No one's heard this music live yet, other than a couple of 3-year-olds.\"\n\nActually, the argument could be made that no one has truly heard the King of Rock 'n' Roll's daughter before. Until now.\n\nPresley punched out two pop albums in 2003 and 2005, but Storm & Grace, out Tuesday, marks the singer's first genuine musical statement, with its mix of rootsy riffs and confessional lyrics.\n\n\"In the past, I was terrified. I'd be nervous and worried about comparisons\" to her pioneering father, says Presley, 44, a petite woman who is almost swallowed up by a midsize gray leather couch.\n\n\"On this record, I was starting from zero,\" she says. \"But I soon realized I was going to be OK. I found a proper bed for my voice and songwriting to lie in.\"\n\nThe man who helped her assemble that sonic furniture was producer T Bone Burnett, who has been on a tear helping storied artists such as Robert Plant and Gregg Allman reinvent themselves. Burnett insists that the demos he received from Presley's new manager, American Idol creator Simon Fuller, had the goods.\n\n\"I heard her telling the truth, not jiving,\" Burnett says. \"Regardless of what crazy roads she's been down, who she is is right there in those songs.\"\n\nThose roads got particularly rutted in the past four years.\n\nBeyond the shocking death of ex-husband Michael Jackson\u2014 whom she won't comment on, other than to say, \"I talked to Oprah about all that\" \u2014 Presley says she was emotionally and fiscally robbed by her closest confidants.\n\n\"I was slowly starting to self-destruct, and I didn't know where that was coming from,\" Presley says without a trace of self-pity. \"I started to uncover the main person who was really close to me for years, and then it was a domino effect. I was devastated.\"\n\nShe won't name names but suggests that the damage was both personal and professional. \"I got bad advice. I was insulated with no grip on reality,\" she says. \"They were taking my soul, my money, my everything.\"\n\nThe singer credits her husband (and musical director) Michael Lockwood, as well as her twin girls, Harper and Finley, 3\u00bd, with keeping her sane. \"They got me through it,\" she says. \"I don't mention this to whine, but just to explain where this music came from.\"\n\nIn one particularly haunting and catchy track, Un-break, she sings: \"I got run over by my own parade, I've suffocated in the beds I've made \u2026 still trying to find a way.\" In So Long, the message is even more direct: \"Farewell, fair-weather friends, can't say that I miss you in the end. So long, seems that I was so wrong.\"\n\nPresley's newfound voice aside, the importance of Burnett signing on to the project \u2014 he was given Presley's demos by Fuller, unbeknownst to the singer \u2014 can't be understated, says Will Hermes, Rolling Stone senior critic.\n\n\"T Bone helps people escape their legacies, and in this case, he seems to be helping Lisa Marie explore musical forms that are closer to her father's,\" he says. \"Working in the shadow of (Elvis) has to be incredibly hard. It's clear in this album that she's looking past his pop fame and more to his roots.\"\n\nBurnett says Elvis' progeny benefited from a few key strands of musical DNA.\n\n\"Of course you see the family resemblance, but she's got his groove, I will tell you that,\" he says, laughing. \"She has that sense of being in the pocket. That's a family trait. Her dad basically invented that pocket.\"\n\nThe producer's favorite song is Un-break, as much for its music as its message. \"It's so tough,\" he says. \"She's saying don't jack me around, don't tread on me.\"\n\nIf Storm & Grace is one big cathartic release, then an important catalyst was Presley's move to England shortly after the twins were born in 2008.\n\nPresley's crew, who enjoy frequent visits from her adult children (Riley, 22, and Benjamin, 19) with first husband Danny Keough, started out in a home west of London before decamping for a sprawling mansion in Kent. She finds it ironic but telling that a move overseas has resulted in an album with unmistakably American roots.\n\n\"It's funny, yeah, but the one thing the British really appreciate is our roots music,\" she says. \"People like Amy Winehouse and Adele, they know where our music comes from. So in a way, it makes sense that I found my way back from there.\"\n\nPresley says she pointedly resisted past suggestions that she record in Nashville (\"I'm from Memphis, I don't need to prove I'm Southern,\" she says with a raised eyebrow) and is convinced her father would approve of her latest effort.\n\n\"I'm guessing he'd be proud,\" she says softly. \"I don't know how he'd feel about the other albums, but maybe he'd understand that I needed to go through that before getting to this. But this one, it's more me.\"\n\nWhat wasn't her was a decidedly vixenish phase a decade back, which today makes Presley cringe.\n\n\"I was pushed to dress really, really super-sexy to try and get young boys going crazy,\" she says. \"I was always fighting it. They were trying to push me to be some sexpot, and I loathed it. It didn't have anything to do with my music. So whenever I got the chance, I'd purposefully wear chains and big giant boots to make it not about being sexy.\"\n\nManager Fuller was intent on letting his charge dictate terms. \"It's important for an artist with Lisa Marie's history and stature to believe in what they do and follow their heart and intuition,\" he says in an e-mail. \"Sometimes it's important to ignore the seductive allure of chasing commercial success, and make an album that you are simply proud of.\"\n\nEven the album's cover signals a new direction for Presley. The images accompanying 2003's To Whom It May Concern and 2005's Now What both highlighted the singer's sultry looks. By contrast, Storm & Grace shows Presley in tall boots and a loose wrap, strolling through some of Graceland's less well-tended grounds.\n\nShe smiles at the memory of the photo shoot.\n\n\"I love Graceland. My heart will always be there,\" she says of the music shrine that was her childhood home until her mother, Priscilla, split with Elvis in 1973, when Lisa Marie was 5. She and her mother work closely on ensuring that the estate remains vibrant, and in February, Lisa Marie helped organize a new exhibit, Elvis \u2026 Through His Daughter's Eyes.\n\n\"I would live there, not that that's possible at the moment,\" she says. \"I love everything about it.\"\n\nAttracted to the bold type\n\nSpeaking of deep passion, the album's title track provides a little unsolved mystery.

I cried while singing the demo.\"\n\nPresley won't talk about her past relationships, which included a short-lived marriage to actor Nicolas Cage. But she offers an insight into the kinds of people she finds irresistible.\n\n\"I was never particularly attracted to mediocrity. I feel suffocated and caged by it,\" she says. \"So I tend to admire artists who push the envelope, who are different, who are changing things, who are interesting.\n\n\"That's what my father did. He started the whole thing, he defied all mediocrity at the time. People were either shocked or they loved him, but he was stepping out there. So I related to that really early, and those are the people who attract my attention,\" she says.\n\nPresley pauses, as if realizing something.\n\n\"I like to push boundaries, but to be honest, this new album is just me not fighting with anyone,\" she says. \"I'm finding I do really well when given the freedom to just be who I am.\"",

Ward said Halpern \"apologized\" that Ward had to see that.\n\n\"Halpern just took offense that people weren't talking about the goal, (but rather) getting into racist remarks,\" Ward said. \"I think he was telling me he had my back, and felt bad that (some Twitter users) were talking about the negative side, instead of how we are moving on.\"\n\nThe NHL, in a statement, said, \"The racially charged comments distributed via digital media following last night's game were ignorant and unacceptable. The people responsible for these comments have no place associating themselves with our game.\"\n\nWard, 31, a four-year NHL veteran, says he never has before experienced any racist remarks directed toward him at the NHL level.\n\n\"Growing up, at a few minor tournaments, you catch a few kids saying things,\" Ward said. \"But at that age, I didn't even know what the terminology meant. But (at this level) I've never heard anything. I know other guys have, I believe, but I've had nothing directed to me like that.\"\n\nWard's goal at 2:57 of overtime knocked off the defending Stanley Cup champions and put the Capitals into the second round against a still-undetermined opponent. Ward had six goals in 73 games this season. \"It was definitely the biggest goal I've ever been a part of,\" he said.\n\nSaid Ward's teammate, Matt Hendricks: \"It was the greatest feeling ever after the game, winning Game 7 in Boston. Then you get on the plane afterward, and have all of this come to life. \u2026 It just made me sick to my stomach.\"\n\nHendricks said he couldn't get the tweets out of his mind. \"What we accomplished just went out the window,\" he said. \"I couldn't think about that any more. It was very disappointing.\"\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers winger Wayne Simmonds, who trains with Ward in the offseason, called the tweets disgusting.\n\n\"Obviously, things get said,\" Simmonds said. \"It's the internet. They can say whatever they want and they don't have to show their face. It's disgusting. I've had things like that happen to me before.\"\n\nDuring a Flyers-Detroit Red Wings preseason game in London, Ontario last Sept. 22, a 26-year-old hockey fan threw a banana peel onto the ice as Simmonds was attempting a shootout attempt.\n\n\"It's not something that you want to happen, but it's sad in this day and age that it continues to happen,\" Simmonds said. \"I'm sure Ward is not even paying attention to it. It is what it is. People can be as gutless as they want and they don't have to show up. They just throw a comment out there on the internet. It's getting kind of ridiculous.\n\n\"I think social media is not meant for that. It's to say, 'Hey, nice goal, congratulations.' \"\n\nWard said he hasn't had time to comb through all of the comments on his own personal Twitter account, but he has seen a summary of the racist-tone posts on various website blogs.\n\n\"I think it is just kids,\" Ward said. \"It has no effect on me whatsoever. I've been playing this game long enough and I've not had any encounters of that nature.\"\n\nHe said he has always felt comfortable in an NHL dressing room and on the ice.\n\n\"There is no lying about it. \u2026I'm definitely the one black guy in a room with 20 white guys,\" Ward said. \"There are definitely some cultural differences, such as taste in music, but I've never heard anything derogatory.\"\n\nHe says he has no concern about his safety moving forward in the playoffs.\n\n\"I'm pretty laid-back and I get along with a lot of people,\" Ward said. \"I don't fear anything like that, and I have a good group of guys to protect me.\"\n\nWard said his goal today is to go on his Twitter account and thank the people who came to his defense through social media. Many have gone after those who posted racist remarks. Some who have made racist comments have already closed their accounts. One person apologized.\n\n\"I'm definitely getting a lot of support,\" Ward said. \"There have been a lot of Boston fans who have supported me, which is very cool to see. No hard feelings from me.

    "text": "Adding to a year of courtroom victories by proponents of same-sex marriage, a federal appeals court on Monday struck down Virginia\u2019s ban on same-sex unions, upholding a lower court\u2019s declaration in February that the state\u2019s restrictive laws were a violation of basic constitutional freedoms.\n\nThe 2-to-1 decision by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., followed similar rulings this summer by the circuit court in Denver striking down same-sex marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma.\n\nThese and other rulings expected in coming months from other appeals courts are likely to propel the issue to the Supreme Court, many legal experts anticipate, perhaps as early as this fall, for a decision by spring that would apply nationwide.\n\nIn Richmond, Judge Henry F. Floyd, writing for the majority, said denying same-sex couples the right to marry \u201cprohibits them from participating fully in our society, which is precisely the type of segregation that the 14th Amendment cannot countenance.\u201d\n\nJudge Floyd cited the landmark 1967 Supreme Court ruling in Loving v. Virginia, which overturned the state\u2019s law against interracial marriage. That and subsequent decisions described a fundamental \u201cright to marry,\u201d Judge Floyd wrote, that \u201cmay stretch to accommodate changing societal norms.\u201d\n\nEmily Schall-Townley, the 16-year-old daughter of two of the plaintiffs in the Virginia case, said she was overjoyed by the decision. \u201cI\u2019ll be able to say without reservation this is my family and these are my two moms,\u201d she said in a telephone conference call.\n\nAn unusual aspect of the Virginia case is that the state government and the state attorney general, Mark R. Herring, a Democrat, refused to defend the ban, including a state amendment adopted by the voters in 2006, and even spoke against it in court. Instead, it was left to two court clerks to defend Virginia\u2019s restrictive laws.\n\nMonday\u2019s ruling did not immediately require Virginia or other states in the Fourth Circuit, which includes North Carolina, South Carolina and West Virginia, to begin issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. (Maryland, also in the circuit, already allows same-sex marriage.)\n\nThe Virginia clerks were expected to seek a stay of the decision, pending either a rehearing by the full circuit court, or consideration of same-sex marriage by the Supreme Court.\n\nByron Babione, a lawyer with Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group that represented one of the clerks, said they were considering their next steps.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Babione praised the dissent by Judge Paul V. Niemeyer, who wrote that \u201cthere is no fundamental right to same-sex marriage and there are rational reasons for not recognizing it\u201d and that the decision should be left up to individual states.\n\nIn a news conference on Monday, the attorney general of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said the state would no longer defend its same-sex marriage ban in four court cases because, in light of the appeals court decision, \u201cour law almost surely will be overturned as well.\u201d\n\nBut that does not mean that same-sex marriages will soon be offered, he said. \u201cIt is time to stop making arguments we will lose and instead move forward,\u201d he said, \u201cknowing that the ultimate resolution will likely come from the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nArguing in Richmond to overturn the Virginia laws were two groups of lawyers and plaintiffs. Acting on behalf of two couples were two prominent lawyers, Theodore B. Olson and David Boies, representing the American Foundation for Equal Rights. A second suit, a class action filed on behalf of all of Virginia\u2019s gay couples, was argued by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal.\n\nMonday\u2019s ruling is the latest in a year of substantial gains for proponents of same-sex marriage. Through elections or state court decisions, same-sex couples have gained the right to marry in 19 states plus the District of Columbia. But federal and state courts in many other states have ruled against marriage restrictions since the Supreme Court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act last year, saying no sound reason existed for denying the benefits of marriage to gay and lesbian people and their children.\n\nThe next circuit court to take up the issue will be the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati. On Aug. 6, it will hear appeals from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, all seeking to void district court rulings overturning their marriage restrictions.\n\nMichael C. Dorf, an expert on constitutional law at the Cornell University Law School, said the Supreme Court was \u201cextremely likely\u201d to choose to hear one or more of the appeals court cases in its coming term, which would result in a decision by June.",

    "text": "When Elisabeth Moss read the script for the indie dramedy \u201cThe One I Love,\u201d she knew that she wanted to star in it.\n\nBut now that she\u2019s promoting the movie, out in theaters Friday, she\u2019s having a hard time discussing it.\n\nIt's not because she\u2019s not proud of it. She\u2019s being careful because the film features a major plot twist that occurs within the first 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re not trying to spoil the ending,\u201d Moss laughed. \u201cBasically we can\u2019t talk about most of the movie.\u201d\n\nWhat she and writer/director Charlie McDowell can talk about is their film\u2019s premise, which is about a married couple named Ethan (Mark Duplass) and Sophie (Moss), who turn to therapy in order to work on their relationship, which has been rocked by infidelity. Their therapist, played by Ted Danson, recommends they go on a week-long retreat at a beautiful estate.\n\nWhat happens next falls into major spoiler territory. But even though the film depicts the couple having an increasingly surreal experience, their relationship problems always remain relatable. McDowell said that is by design.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make a movie that felt like a really real relationship dramedy,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted any decisions that were made to feel like they were real and organic to these characters and this situation.\u201d\n\nMoss said the challenge for her was to figure out \u201cwhat is a real girl in a real relationship after four years of marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was really important for us to make it all real,\u201d she added. \u201cEven though there\u2019s a supernatural element ... I felt like it wasn\u2019t going to work if you didn\u2019t believe in this couple, and you don\u2019t believe this marriage is real, in all scenarios.\u201d\n\nBoth Moss and Duplass had a hand in shaping their characters in order to make them feel relatable. In fact, Duplass, best known for starring in the indie romance \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed\u201d and writing and directing films such as \u201cCyrus\u201d and \u201cBaghead,\u201d is the one who came up with \u201cThe One I Love\u2019s\u201d premise.\n\nMcDowell and co-writer Justin Lader took inspiration from Duplass\u2019 idea and made it into a screenplay, which became the duo\u2019s first feature film. \u201cThe One I Love\u201d was only shot in 15 days, a breakneck pace that was greatly accommodated by the fact that the movie only had one major setting: a beautiful house in Ojai, Calif.\n\nMcDowell, 31, knows the home well because he grew up in Ojai, a small town located just outside Los Angeles. He said that the residence, which features a guesthouse and pool, actually helped him and Lader figure out the screenplay\u2019s plot.\n\n\u201cWe wrote it specifically for that location, which is a really interesting way to write something,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe kind of reverse-engineered the script specific to the location, which is a kind of bizarre way to do it but ended up working very well,\u201d he added.\n\nThe writer-director also drew on his Hollywood lineage in making the film. The son of actors Malcolm McDowell and Mary Steenburgen, he cast his mother\u2019s husband in the pivotal role as the therapist, while her voice is heard during a phone call.\n\nDespite his famous family ties, McDowell said he originally didn\u2019t want to pursue a career in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cI was very anti the industry for a while because I didn\u2019t want to be in the shadow of very successful people and wanted my own identity,\u201d he explained.\n\nOne of the few times he has appeared onscreen was in Steenburgen\u2019s 1989 film \u201cParenthood,\u201d as one of the kids in the birthday party featuring Steve Martin dressed as a cowboy. He recalls getting \u201ccranky\u201d while working \u201cin the hot sun\u201d as an extra, but that seeing director Ron Howard \u201csitting in the shade watching a monitor\u201d piqued his interest.\n\n\u201cI thought, I want to be that guy,\u201d he laughed. \u201cWhich was funny because so many years later, that\u2019s what I ended up doing.\u201d\n\nMcDowell, who is the youngest-ever graduate from the American Film Institute, said that directors who inspire him include Paul Thomas Anderson, David Fincher and Spike Jonze. He said that he admired Jonze\u2019s work \u201cin terms of taking a high-concept idea and (marrying it to a) traditional story at its core, and then taking you on this wild ride.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also an apt way to describe \u201cThe One I Love.\u201d Moss, 32, described the experience of watching the film as \u201cgreat movie magic,\u201d but even with the strange situations her character finds herself in, she could see a parallel between Sophie and Peggy Olson, her character on \u201cMad Men.\u201d\n\n\u201cSophie, in a way, sort of represents the everywoman in a marriage, as Peggy sort of represents the everywoman in the workplace,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeggy is one of the people who has sort of taught us that we should be able to do it all,\u201d the actress added. \u201cBut as women we\u2019re still human and we still have vulnerabilities and we\u2019re still not perfect. And so I think that that sort of struggle to find lasting love is a question they\u2019re both trying to answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Sophie is better at it than Peggy though,\u201d Moss joked. \u201cMaybe Peggy should be sent off by Ted Danson to the house.

    "text": "Over the past decade or two, the idea of mentoring has become increasingly popular. Lots of companies now offer mentoring programs, where executive-level professionals support their younger colleagues\u2019 success. Mentoring programs have been created specifically for women, people of color, the disabled, and other groups for whom having a supportive and knowledgeable advisor might be especially helpful. Youth mentoring has evolved as a means to help young people understand how to operate in the grown-up world.\n\nHowever, the tradition of having someone to support you with his or her wisdom and experience is probably as old as the human race. In any tribal society, younger members depended upon the older members to pass on their hard-won knowledge and insight about how to stay safe, find food and shelter, understand the world around them.\n\nThe word \u201cmentor\u201d as applied to such a person has its roots in Greek mythology. In the Odyssey, Mentor was a character who advised and protected Odysseus\u2019 son Telemachus. Then, in 1699, a novel called Les Aventures de T\u00e9l\u00e9maque, (\u201cThe Adventures of Telemachus\u201d), included the character of Mentor as Telemachus\u2019 tutor. He was the hero of the story, and the modern usage of the term \u201cmentor\u201d seems to have arisen from that book.\n\nSo, finding and having a mentor isn\u2019t just a modern fad; it\u2019s a time-honored practice that has served us well for many thousands of years. And as with most things, there are good mentors and there are not-so-good mentors. What can you do to make sure you\u2019re getting one of the good ones?\n\nOver the years, as I\u2019ve observed mentoring relationships of various sorts, and have been asked by others to mentor them, I\u2019ve noticed some qualities that seem to distinguish truly good and helpful mentors from those who are indifferent \u2013 or even harmful. Based on that experience, here are five core qualities to look for in a mentor:\n\nSelf-reflection: If you want someone to share their wisdom with you, they need to have wisdom to share. Some people simply don\u2019t spend much time thinking about their own experience; a person can be quite knowledgeable and successful without having reflected much on how they got where they are today. However, just hearing about what someone has done is much less valuable than hearing about why they did it, and about their understanding of why it worked or didn\u2019t work. My father, one of my most important mentors, was great at seeing the key patterns and principles in his own experience, and passing those on to me. His insights about his life have helped me avoid innumerable pitfalls in my own life.\n\nDiscretion: In a good mentor relationship, you need to be able to be honest about your own life and circumstances \u2013 and you need to be confident that your revelations won\u2019t go beyond your mentor. If he or she can\u2019t be trusted to keep confidences, your relationship will be superficial at best \u2013 damaging at worst. I know of one mentee who shared with his mentor, in confidence, his frustrations about his boss\u2019 poor delegation \u2014 only to discover, when he was later called on the carpet, that the mentor had told his boss. The mentor said that she\u2019d done it to \u201ccreate more openness between them\u201d \u2013 but, unfortunately, that strategy backfired, and the mentee was left with a worse relationship with his boss than before.\n\nHonesty: If you\u2019re brave enough to ask your mentor for advice, he or she needs to be brave enough to give you a straight answer. If you\u2019re contemplating taking a new job, for instance, and you explain the situation and ask for your mentor\u2019s point of view \u2013 he or she should give it to you, unvarnished. I was in that situation a few years ago, and told my mentee that it didn\u2019t sound like a great opportunity; I thought she was overqualified, and would soon be bored with the job. She responded that, while she agreed, she believed she could quickly get promoted. I encouraged her to look more closely at that part of the organization and decide whether that was a realistic expectation, or wishful thinking on her part. She ultimately chose not to go for the job, because on deeper exploration it looked as though there was actually very little possibility for advancement.\n\nCuriosity: This one may seem counter-intuitive \u2013 isn\u2019t it the mentee\u2019s responsibility to be curious about the mentor? Yes. And\u2026if the mentor isn\u2019t curious about you: who you are, how you\u2019re wired, what\u2019s important to you, what you\u2019ve done so far and how it\u2019s working for you \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely his or her advice will be very helpful. It will more likely be generic wisdom that won\u2019t be targeted to you at all. One mentee was thrilled to be connected with a very senior, very experienced executive in his organization. But after the first few months of being dazzled by the big names and big experiences the mentor threw around, the mentee realized that she knew nothing about him, and wasn\u2019t sharing anything much that he could apply to his own career.\n\nGenerosity of Spirit: This is essential. A great mentor wants you to succeed, and he or she will actively support your success with words and action. The great mentor will never be envious or feel threatened by your growth; he or she will congratulate you on your triumphs and help you recover from your setbacks. The generous mentor will make connections or offer resources that could be useful to you whenever he or she can. Most important, a generous mentor believes in your potential, and communicates that to you freely and with hope. The generous mentor supports you to become the person you want to become.\n\nHaving a mentor can be helpful; having a mentor who is self-reflective, discreet, honest, curious, and generous can be life-changing.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear about any experiences you\u2019ve had with a mentor, good or bad, and any other advice you might have for choosing a great one.\n\nWhat\u2019s leader readiness?

    "text": "A new political action committee dedicated to campaign finance reform wants to be a big player in 2016, and it\u2019s planning to funnel tens of millions of dollars to Democratic candidates running in competitive House and Senate races across the country.\n\nThe group, End Citizens United, which officially launched this month, has raised more than $2 million from small donors so far \u2014 and the group is on track to rake in a total of $25 million to $30 million for the entire entire cycle, said communications director Richard Carbo.\n\nRELATED: Influence of wealthy donors becoming an issue in GOP primaries\n\nThe group\u2019s ultimate goal is to pass a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, which in 2010 gave rise to super PACs and unleashed a tidal wave of dark money into politics. So far, more than 325,000 people have signed End Citizens United\u2019s petition demanding Congress pass such legislation. That number is likely to receive a boost, as the group has partnered with \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d and will rent out its email list \u2014 which includes upwards of 4 million people \u2014 to reach out to potential liberal supporters.\n\nThis month, End Citizens United also announced its endorsement of 11 Democratic candidates, including former Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado.\n\nWhile there have been other PACs that focus on campaign finance reform, Carbo said his group is different because \u201cthere was a hole in the conversation addressing the political side of it and actually getting people elected\u201d who could change existing laws. That means backing candidates who are in favor of campaign finance reform, who will stand up against Citizens United \u2014 in addition to those who are under attack by the billionaire conservative Koch brothers and other related dark-money groups.\n\nThe group plans on setting up an independent expenditure arm sometime early next year to financially back the candidates through initiatives including television ads, direct mailers and polling.\n\nWhile End Citizens United also hopes to help enact campaign finance reforms on the local and state level, its main objective of passing a constitutional amendment to overturn the 2010 Supreme Court decision is being met with some skepticism by campaign finance experts. A constitutional amendment, after all, must win consent from two-thirds of the Senate and the House, in addition to being ratified by three-fourths of states.\n\nRELATED: Ted Cruz\u2019s billionaire hedge fund backer emerges as top 2016 donor\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really high bar to for a constitutional amendment,\u201d said John Wonderlich, policy director at the Sunlight Foundation, a non-partisan group that advocates for government transparency. \u201cIt\u2019s an uphill battle for people who choose that path.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s putting it mildly. America hasn\u2019t passed a single Constitutional amendment since 1992. And Washington has gotten exponentially more partisan since.\n\nRick Hasen, a campaign finance regulation expert and professor of law and political science at UC-Irvine School of Law, put it in more stark terms. \u201cLet\u2019s say the group raised $100 million \u2014 the chances that even that amount of money to get a constitutional amendment passed by electing some sympathetic members of Congress is a pipe dream.\u201d He said a greater likelihood of getting the law changed is confirming a new Supreme Court justice \u2014 when the time comes \u2014 who could shift the balance of the court.\n\nBut, Hasen argued, groups like End Citizens United do serve a purpose in \u201ccontinuing with the public awareness of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and it keeps political pressure on both the Supreme Court and other political actors to not make things worse.\u201d\n\nAnd Carbo argued that having access to $25 million to $30 million can mean a significant ad buy that could \u201creally impact a House race.\u201d\n\nRELATED: The money race leaves some candidates behind\n\nSo why isn\u2019t End Citizens United backing Republicans? \u201cEven though many Republicans and Independent voters agree that undisclosed political spending is out of control, Republican leadership in Congress is standing squarely in the way of overturning this disastrous Supreme Court decision,\u201d the group says on its website. \u201cIt has to stop. So we will do what we can to support candidates who are champions for meaningful campaign finance reform.\u201d\n\nThe group boasts of receiving 136,000 donations so far and having vast grassroots support with an average donation of $14.86.\n\nThe D.C.-based PAC has just five staff members, including senior advisers Valerie Martin, who worked on Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill\u2019s 2006 campaign, and Reed Adamson, who helped manage Illinois Rep. Brad Schneider\u2019s 2012 victory.",

The Mexicans said when they learned that a Honduran also survived, they kept it a secret to protect him. But Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa revealed the information earlier this week.\n\nInvestigators believe the Zetas drug gang kidnapped the migrants and gunned them down after they refused to work for the cartel.\n\nMarines found the bound, blindfolded bodies slumped against a wall last week after raiding the ranch in the northern state of Tamaulipas, which has been embroiled in a vicious turf battle between the Zetas and their former employer, the Gulf Cartel.\n\nMexican officials say cartels have increasingly been recruiting vulnerable migrants to smuggle drugs.\n\nAfter the shooting stopped, the Honduran survivor managed to untie himself, then helped free the Ecuadorean, who had been shot in the neck, Rivera said.\n\nRivera did not say whether the Honduran was hurt but the Ecuadorean survivor, Luis Freddy Lala Pomavilla, told state-run television in Ecuador on Thursday that the Honduran somehow managed to avoid being shot.\n\nLala, 18, was flown home to Ecuador on Sunday after recovering from his wounds at a Mexican hospital. He is now under a witness protection program in Ecuador. The Honduran is under the protection of Mexican security forces.\n\nRivera said the two migrants fled the ranch together but when they heard gunshots behind them, they separated.\n\nLala said he approached two groups of people who refused to help him until he finally reached the marine checkpoint.\n\nThe Honduran, Rivera said, walked for a long time until he found a migrant shelter. Rivera revealed no other details about the migrant's escape, but said he was in good health and had been in contact with his family in Honduras.\n\nLala told Ecuadorean television that a total of 76 migrants were traveling together \u2014 Hondurans, Ecuadoreans, Guatemalans and at least one Brazilian.\n\nBut a spokesman for Mexico's Attorney General's Office, Ricardo Najera, said Friday that 77 people were in the group: the 72 killed, the two survivors and three Mexicans whose whereabouts were unknown.\n\nThe Mexicans were two drivers and an assistant, he said, adding the information came from the testimony of the Honduran and the Ecuadorean migrants.\n\nIn a statement that Lala gave to Mexican investigators, he said one migrant agreed to work with the Zetas, but did not reveal what happened to that person. The Associated Press has access to that statement last week.\n\nDuring a meeting in Guatemala, meanwhile, Central American foreign ministers urged Mexico to find the killers and take steps to avoid more atrocities.\n\n\"We call on Mexican authorities to take measures as soon as possible to avoid events like the one that occurred in Tamaulipas,\" said Honduran Foreign Minister Mario Canahuati.",

Remove the core from 250g of spring cabbage, then roughly chop the leaves and wash them. Cook the cabbage in a saucepan with a little boiling water then drain thoroughly.\n\nSlice 3 spring onions finely, discarding any tough dark green leaves as you go. Chop 8 tbsp of herbs. I used dill, mint, tarragon and parsley \u2013 but it will depend what you have around. Wash a couple of handfuls of watercress, shake them dry and set aside.\n\nDrain the potatoes thoroughly, add 40g of butter then mash them using a food mixer fitted with a flat paddle, or with a potato masher. Fold the drained spring cabbage, well drained of any liquid, and the herbs into the potato together with a little ground black pepper.\n\nRoll the mixture into 9 balls or thick patties, using a little flour on your hands if necessary. Warm a thin layer of olive oil and a little butter in a shallow, nonstick pan over a moderate heat, then lower in the patties, letting them cook for 5 or 6 minutes until pale gold and lightly crisp on the underside. Turn each over and brown the other side.\n\nDivide the watercress among 3 plates then add the sizzling patties. Serves 2-3.\n\nTraditionally, bubble and squeak was a way to use up leftover vegetables from the Sunday roast, but I think it is worth making from scratch, with freshly mashed potatoes and crisp spring greens. Drain the potatoes thoroughly, to avoid a wet mash. Wring the greens lightly in your fist \u2013 this is important - to squeeze out any excess water.\n\nI like this made with pale green early summer cabbage, but also try cavolo nero or tenderstem broccoli. The mixture of herbs is up to you. Parsley is a must, but any soft-stemmed herbs can be used. Avoid thyme, sage and rosemary here and go for the tender herbs such as tarragon, mint, fennel fronds and dill.\n\nEmail Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater",

    "text": "Williams will face Vera Zvonareva, the 21st seed, in the women\u2019s final Saturday. Expect an additional ace (or 15).\n\nThis year, this Wimbledon, Williams has served aces at an eye-popping pace, even by her lofty standards. In the first round, she laced 15 aces past Michelle Larcher de Brito. In the third round against Dominika Cibulkova, and again in the fourth against Maria Sharapova, Williams pounded 19 aces.\n\nAlready, she held the ace record for one Wimbledon, with 72 spread over the fortnight in 2009. But Williams compiled 73 aces before the semifinals this year, then added another seven Thursday. Her closest competitor? Her sister Venus Williams with 30 total aces.\n\nAsked if the tape on her shoulder in a doubles match Wednesday was for injury, or preventative, Williams laughed and said, \u201cI had hit too many aces, so my shoulder was done.\u201d\n\nShe laughed again, then added, \u201cI was just trying to recover.\u201d\n\nWilliams landed 70 percent of her first serves in Thursday, and, not surprisingly, she won 77 percent of those points. She had 32 unreturned serves. She served fast (reaching 119 miles an hour, averaging 109 m.p.h. on her first serve). And she employed variety (44 percent wide, 44 percent center line, 12 percent at the body; 53 percent at the backhand, 47 percent forehand).\n\nAfter Williams pulled out a close fourth-round match, in which the difference had been the first shot of each point, Sharapova said if Williams continued to serve that way, no player at Wimbledon could beat her. So far, Williams has proved Sharapova right.\n\nEarlier this tournament, as she registered three of her four highest single-match ace totals this season, even Williams marveled at her serve. She said that she \u201chad a talk\u201d with her most consistent weapon after a quarterfinal exit at the French Open.\n\n\u201cYou know who\u2019s been the best server in the tournament, bar none, of the eight still left?\u201d Brad Gilbert, the coach and ESPN commentator, posted on his Twitter page. \u201cSW. Her serve has been en fuego this fortnight.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019s results depend heavily on how well she serves, which in tennis is not unusual. Of her 10 highest single-match ace totals in 2010, nine came in victories, the other in that quarterfinal loss in Paris.\n\nOften, when Williams has found trouble in this tournament, her serve has come to the rescue. Shriver praised Williams\u2019s second serve almost as highly as her first, for the variety employed, how Williams hits each of the four corners, full of bravado, never backing off.\n\nAt 20, the youngest Grand Slam semifinalist this year, Kvitova did not seem overwhelmed by the moment. She found herself on Centre Court, against Williams, the defending and three-time champion, with a berth in the final at stake. Yet she forced a first set tie breaker with fortitude and guts.\n\nBehind her serve, Williams burst to a 4-0 tie-breaker lead. Again, Kvitova rallied. But at 6-5, Williams unleashed a serve that echoed across the grounds, followed by a grunt loud even by her normal decibel level. The return landed out and Kvitova never again threatened. Williams still called her performance \u201coff.\u201d\n\nIn Zvonareva, she will meet an opponent who reached a No. 5 world ranking as recently as February 2009, until injuries and inconsistency sent her backward. She had surgery on her right ankle last November. Next week she will probably climb back into the top 10.\n\nWhen not playing tennis, Zvonareva studies international economic relations at a diplomatic academy in Russia, her focus on international affairs. But not even the graduate student could explain Williams\u2019s serve, except to say: \u201cIt\u2019s a very big advantage. Especially on grass.\u201d\n\nFor Zvonareva to have any chance Saturday, she must, if not stop the most feared serve in tennis, at least slow it. Good luck.\n\nWilliams said she learned early in her career that big points required big serves, that she could erase break chances with a single shot. What seemed to surprise her was that later in her \u201cserve\u2019s career,\u201d it has gotten sharper, faster, more accurate.\n\nIn fact, her serve has become something of its own person, almost another Williams sister. It holds conversations, has its own career.\n\n\u201cOn paper, it looks like I should win,\u201d Williams said of her chances in the final.\n\nIf she does, if she captures her fourth Wimbledon title and second in a row, she will probably owe Miss Serve a thank-you.",

(Reuters Photo)\n\nThat's the message to AIG executives from more than three out of four Americans, according to a new Rasmussen Reports poll.\n\nThe national telephone survey found that 76 percent of those polled think the executives receiving $165 million in bonuses from the bailed-out insurance giant should be required to give the money back.\n\nThe payments have been the source of growing public outrage and political finger-pointing, as lawmakers try to determine how to recover at least part of the money. They say AIG, which has been promised more than $170 billion in federal bailout money, acted irresponsibly in doling out bonuses to many executives who helped destabilize the company in the first place.\n\nAIG Chairman Edward Liddy told a House panel Wednesday that some of the executives have volunteered to give at least part of their bonuses back. Lawmakers, though, want to tax up to 100 percent of the money in order to recover it.\n\nIn the latest poll, just 17 percent said the AIG executives should keep the bonuses. And the survey suggested the matter could continue to pose a major distraction as President Obama tries to turn the nation's focus to his $3.6 trillion budget proposal.\n\nThe poll showed 88 percent of Americans say they are following media coverage of the bonuses at least somewhat closely, with 55 percent following coverage very closely. The cross section of people not following the AIG story is a skimpy 2 percent.\n\nIn addition, the survey found 68 percent think most of the taxpayer bailout money so far has gone to the same people who caused the economic crisis.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,000 adults on Tuesday and Wednesday and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\n\nClick here to read the entire report from Rasmussen Reports.",

    "text": "Businesses that have had any dealings overseas this year are no strangers to currency volatility. From the rollercoaster ride of the yuan earlier in 2016 to the impact of the shock Brexit vote in the UK, the foreign exchange markets have seldom seen a calm period.\n\nHowever, businesses with their eyes firmly fixed on the Brexit storm close to home may be ignoring another potential cause of further FX swings. Debate by debate, the US election is inching ever closer, and economic experts are already indicating that they are expecting an increase in volatility over the period.\n\nAn election year is always a time of uncertainty, and as a rule markets do not like times of doubt. It is common for currencies to weaken in the run up to an election \u2013 this happened with the US dollar when Obama was elected to his second term in 2012.\n\nHowever, this is not always the case, particularly when there are other factors at play. The US dollar is seen as a \u201csafe haven\u201d currency, and often strengthens in times of global turmoil, no matter the issues on the domestic front.\n\nThe US currency tends to react more favourably to Democrats in the White House\n\nIn the run up to the 2008 election, for example, the US dollar strengthened against the pound, reacting to the Lehman Brothers collapse and the global shockwaves this sent.\n\nAnd the US elections don\u2019t just affect the performance of the US dollar; it affects other related currencies. We\u2019ve already seen in this election that the performance of the Mexican peso (and other emerging currencies where there are strong US trade links) is reacting strongly to poll data.\n\nFor businesses, the risk of currency volatility in election year is an added complexity. For those who have exposure to international payments and receivables, a period of volatility should be factored in.\n\nThis may be the time to try to take control of currency exposure, before the US elections, rather than to find that business performance is impacted by volatility before the US goes to the polls, or by the result.\n\nWith two very different candidates competing to control the world\u2019s biggest economy, it\u2019s still too early to call the result.\n\nInvestors will be asking questions about how the US economy will perform under either candidate, and looking for lessons from history about what might happen next.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen in this election that the performance of the Mexican peso is reacting strongly to poll data\n\nAccording to research from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, the US currency tends to react more favourably to Democrats in the White House than Republicans. However, there are notable exceptions such as Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term, when interest rates were raised to tackle inflation.\n\nBut the dollar does tend to rise after any election, no matter who the winning candidate. It strengthened in 1993, 2001 and 2009, after the election of Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. With uncertainty resolved, the currency became stronger.\n\nWhoever ends up in the White House, victory for either side won\u2019t be the only drag on currency volatility. With the likely outcome including a divided Senate, the market response will also depend on how likely it is that the president will be able to enact his or her policies.\n\nFor businesses, the important thing is to take into account likely rockiness ahead and ensure that they have a strategy to reduce currency risk.\n\nFind out about Western Union's business solutions",

The 2012 Olympic Games were a joyous occasion for those lucky enough to enjoy the sports and sunshine on offer. Home crowds witnessed wonderful performances from the host nation, and many others, and for 17 magical days, it felt as if London was the global capital of sport.\n\nA year on, we\u2019ll get to do some of it all over again. In a sensible bit of rebranding, this July\u2019s London Grand Prix will be called the London 2012 Anniversary Games. Traditionally held at Crystal Palace, it will take place in the Olympic Stadium on the anniversary weekend of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Games this July 26-28. Tickets went on sale Friday morning and the first two days sold out in 75 minutes.\n\n(MORE: TIME\u2019s 2012 Olympics Coverage)\n\nAnd the confirmed names will surely help put bums on seats. On Tuesday, Britain\u2019s golden girl, the 27-year-old heptathlon winner Jessica Ennis announced her participation, and she\u2019ll compete against Olympic champion Sally Pearson in the 100m hurdles. And she\u2019ll be joined at the Games by the two British males who also won gold on the night known as Super Saturday: 5,000 and 10,000 meter winner Mo Farah and long jumper Greg Rutherford.\n\n\u201cI have amazing memories of competing in the Olympic Stadium and it will be good to step out on that track again in front of a British crowd,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the noise the crowd made when I competed last August and know that the draw of the stadium and the great line-up of athletes will fill the stands and make it another incredible occasion.\u201d\n\n(VIDEO: Britain\u2019s Track & Field Golden Girl Jessica Ennis Gets Set for her Home Games)\n\nIn total, all five of Team GB\u2019s track and field medal winners will be there, along with 14 of Britain\u2019s 16 Paralympic medalists.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest draw will be a certain sprinter. On Wednesday, the fastest man in the world, Usain Bolt, confirmed that he\u2019ll be taking part in the 100m on the Friday, and 4x100m relay the following day. The 26-year-old Jamaican won three golds at last year\u2019s Olympics, in the 100m, 200m, and 4x100m relay, but, apart from the 2012 Games, hasn\u2019t raced in Britain since 2009. It\u2019s been reported that the reason is due to tax rules which would have made him give up a share of any appearance or prize money, plus a cut of endorsements. It might not be a coincidence but the recent U.K. budget changed the rules so that athletes such as Bolt are now exempt from paying income tax, which has positive implications for him this July as well as at next year\u2019s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\n(MORE: Will Usain Bolt Try the Long Jump In Rio?)\n\nBolt was fully focused on matters of sport Wednesday, rather than tax, noting that, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to coming back to the U.K., especially with it being a year since winning three gold medals in the Olympic Stadium.\u201d He emphasized that \u201cthe crowds were amazing at the Games and I hope they will be out again in their numbers at the end of July.\u201d\n\nFor the likes of Bolt, Ennis and Farah, the London 2012 Anniversary Games should also serve as a warm-up for the World Athletics Championships, which take place in Moscow in August. Gold medals may not be at stake in London, but that shouldn\u2019t dim competition. A year later, everyone still wants to win.\n\nMORE: \u2018We Got Willy Wonka\u2019s Ticket\u2019\u2019: Inside Britain\u2019s Big Night at the Track",

Eight times in the last 24 years, the Fairfax County School Board has studied whether to let high school students start school later than 7:20 a.m. because teens are biologically programmed for a late-to-bed and late-to-rise schedule.\n\nYes, I said eight times in the last 24 years.\n\n(bigstockphoto) And now, yet again, the board has set up a work group to write a request for proposal so that they can hire a consultant who can then spend time figuring out whether and how to change school start times so kids don\u2019t go to school like walking zombies. (You can read about the work group here, on my colleague Emma Brown\u2019s Virginia Schools Insider blog.)\n\nBeing deliberate is a good and important thing, and it makes sense for the school board to be careful about proceeding with this. But being deliberate and careful is not an excuse for standing still.\n\n(Did I mention eight times in the last 24 years?)\n\nAs it is now, most Fairfax high schools expect students to be in their chairs to start their first class at 7:20 a.m.\u2014 and some get picked up at 5:45 a.m. (Yes, 5:45 a.m.) High schools in Arlington open nearly an hour later, and in Loudoun, most start at 9 a.m.\n\nThe National Sleep Foundation says that American teens need about 9\u00bc hours of sleep a night, but only 8 percent of them are getting it. As much as two-thirds of high school students get seven hours or less a night.\n\nOver the past dozen years or so, researchers have learned that a teen\u2019s body is different from those of younger and older people. Most teens can\u2019t easily fall asleep until about 11 p.m., experts say, and their brains stay in sleep mode until at least 8 a.m. This helps explain why so many high school students stagger into school clutching cups of coffee, hoping the caffeine will wake them up.\n\nDozens of school systems around the country have changed to later high school start times, and a number of benefits have been cited in some of them, including an improvement in academic performance as well as a drop in tardiness.\n\nFairfax recently announced a change in start times at several dozen schools next fall, most of them elementary schools. Some of the changes amount to as little as five minutes, while others are up to 40 minutes. Parents complained.\n\nSo it is clear that the school board is walking a fine line trying to find start times that make sense, won\u2019t upset families and won\u2019t cost much or any new money.\n\nStill, it is the 21st century and it\u2019s time to stop ignoring the science that tell us that teens should start school later than they now do in Fairfax. We don\u2019t need a consultant to review what we already know.\n\nFairfax is one of the finest school systems in the country. Surely there are people in the system already who know how to change bus schedules and manage the change this will cause to schools and parents.\n\nThe school board just needs to go ahead and do it. Eight times in 24 years is enough.\n\nFollow The Answer Sheet every day by bookmarking www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet.",

    "text": "Everyone knows they should eat fruits and vegetables. Few people hear it from fast-food companies and snack purveyors. That is changing as companies that make foods rich in fat and salt aggressively market healthier options.\n\nMcDonald's ( MCD - news - people ) launched a line of all-fruit smoothies earlier this month, a move that could help the fast-food giant fend off critics of its traditional fare and marketing practices. Most recently, the Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group The Center for Science in the Public Interest griped that McDonald's shouldn't reward a child with a toy, as it offers with Happy Meals, for eating unhealthy food. McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker says the company has been working since 2003 to make its menu more appealing to health-conscious consumers. He called the CSPI's complaints \"unprofessional\" and \"destructive.\"\n\nThe Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's isn't the only company feeling the heat, as officials from the Federal Trade Commission, Food and Drug Administration and other government agencies have proposed a set of regulations limiting what kinds of food can be marketed toward children under the age of 18.\n\nDublin, Ohio-based fast food chain Wendy's ( WEN - news - people ) recently rolled out an ad campaign that touts its salads, mentioning their freshness and high-quality ingredients. And Denver's Chipotle Mexican Grill ( CMGB - news - people ) is running a new ad campaign called \"Food With Integrity,\" making note of the quality of the ingredients it uses in its burritos and other offerings.\n\nSome companies are positioning their operations as soldiers in the battle against bad food and unhealthy eating. Kraft Foods ( KFT - news - people ) this month announced an iPad application with games and videos called Big Fork Little Fork, which offers parents recipes and tips on healthy eating.\n\nMeanwhile, deli meat manufacturer Boar's Head is backing an ad campaign that invites consumers to \"Launch an Assault on Salt.\" The campaign aims to give consumers advice on how to maintain a balanced diet with its low-sodium products.\n\nSome companies are going too far. PepsiCo ( PEP - news - people ) was blasted earlier this month when Food Frontiers, a company blog detailing PepsiCo's efforts to make their offerings healthier and more ecologically friendly, was added as a sponsored blog to the popular blogging network ScienceBlogs. Contributors and readers alike were furious with the decision. After trying to clarify the nature of the blog, Seed Media, the owner of ScienceBlogs, and Pepsi removed the blog from the ScienceBlogs community. The blog still appears on Pepsi's corporate blog network.\n\n\"While some members did not see the site as an appropriate venue for a blog sponsored by a food and beverage company, we remain fully committed to engaging directly with the scientific community to improve public health,\" says Pepsi spokesman Jeff Dahncke.\n\nWill consumers buy these new pitches? Three Web videos McDonald's has produced to promote healthy eating aren't getting many views. The company quietly rolled them out on May 14 to promote fruit, vegetables and making good choices when it comes to food. One is called \"Fruit is Fun\"; another is a rap-like cartoon video featuring a character called the \"Yummivore,\" who loves healthy food. The three videos have been viewed a total of just 4,500 times.\n\nSome industry experts take a skeptical view of the new positioning. \"This is about marketing, not health,\" says Marian Nestle, professor at New York University and author of nutrition-related books including Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health.",

He was subjected to prolonged interrogation, lie-detector tests, was given sodium pentothal ''truth serum'' and, finally, LSD.\n\nDuring this ordeal, over a period of several weeks, he made several confessions. He later asserted that these were false. In any case, he was never formally charged with a crime. Indeed, so far as viewers know, there was no evidence to link him to the disappearance of the papers.\n\nGiven an administrative discharge on orders from the Pentagon, Mr. Thornwell, hitherto ambitious and outgoing, found himself emotionally adrift. He had trouble holding a job. A first marriage broke up, as did a second.\n\nHe did not know what it was that the investigators gave to him to drink, only that it made him feel as though he were going mad and that the experience continued to haunt him. He wanted to sue the Army, but lawyers confronted a stone wall of silence and denial.\n\nFinally, under the Freedom of Information Act, a lawyer in Oakland, Calif., where Mr. Thornwell was drifting, secured the relevant documents, and they were so damning that Congress awarded him $625,000 as an indemnity.\n\nIn March 1979, ''60 Minutes'' broadcast a segment about Mr. Thornwell. The producer, Harry Moses, decided he could only do full justice to the story by a dramatic presentation. Eventually he found a producer who permitted him to direct the drama himself.\n\nOne can only wish that Mr. Moses and the writer, Michael de Guzman, had been bolder in their intentions. Too much of what is on the screen is a prosaic recounting of day-to-day Army life, fragments of what was still largely a Jim Crow upbringing in South Carolina, and the wordless bafflement and frustration of Mr. Thornwell after his discharge.\n\nMany questions are left unanswered, and in a docudrama, reasonable suppositions would have been better than nothing. One cannot help wondering, as the investigation drags on and Mr. Thornwell is placed in solitary confinement, apparently for days at a time, why he does not even ask to speak to a lawyer. More important, the apparent reason for his being singled out for this treatment among many potential suspects is not made dramatically plausible. Army counterintelligence operatives are not usually geniuses of detection, but one keeps thinking that it must have been something more than the fact that they were unreconstructed rednecks and he was a black who dated a Frenchwoman.\n\nGlynn Turman, who appeared in the screen version of ''The River Niger'' and in ''Cooley High,'' does well as the young soldier who tries to conceal his insecurity behind a mask of arrogance. The plump and kindly Vincent Gardenia is not altogether well cast as the head of the team that eventually administers the LSD to Mr. Thornwell.\n\nThis scene, in which he is given the LSD in a liquid mixture, ought to be the climax of the drama. It provides little sense of what the taking of hallucinogenic drugs is like. Instead, there is only Mr. Turman's almost wordless sobbing.",

We predicted that chip orders would soon turn sharply higher, on the heels of slack summer and early fall demand, as business confidence revived and a modest inventory bulge--largely around PCs--was worked off. We noted that chip distributors had slackened their frenetic post-iPad breakaway ordering after Intel signaled slower PC sales, with many of the distributors mistakenly predicting a new recession. Instead, it was a normal intra-cycle reset, and the stocks are now telling you we're back off to the races.\n\nTwo weeks ago Analog Devices ( ADI - news - people ) noted resumed order growth, pushed by low inventories and increased customer expedited requests. A handful of chipmakers told us, and investors on a trip we hosted, that end markets remained largely strong, with automotive, industrial and telecomm infrastructure customers downright \"giddy,\" to quote the founder of one of Silicon Valley's most historically successful companies. Shortening lead-times have mostly run their course, and when broad economic growth accelerates in the world's largest economy, the U.S., sees steady gains in the second largest, Japan, and remains vibrant in the third, Germany, it's not all that tough to see what comes next.\n\nNo chip company has yet revised its guidance; instead they formally continue to mouth caution and prudent skepticism over so-called macro issues such as the euro and China. But the antecedents of upward revisions in sales and earnings forecasts are there, if you know where to look--namely, in public remarks of low inventories, strong-end markets and increased turns activity from customers that only several months ago were pushing back and delaying receipt of previously placed bookings.\n\nMany on Wall Street will wait for company press releases before raising numbers and re-issuing bullish price targets, yet the stocks have been running well for two months, and it seems clear the summer bear raid is over. So, what lies next? We continue to think business confidence is the key variable missing from a classic cyclical recovery, encompassing strong fixed investments, the much desired complement to the past year and a half's strong capital goods exports. Not only have corporate profits blown through the roof on the heels of respectable revenue gains, but insatiable demand for technologically sophisticated infrastructure has remained intact since early in the decade, when China and then India bought into the capitalist, free market model.\n\nCountries interested in trading with the U.S.--and other strong global economies--need to be able to plug their commercial flows into ours. The rest of the world needs what we, Germany, Japan and other developed nations take for granted, and will need semiconductors to get there.\n\nSimultaneously, the developed semiconductor markets are not standing still. As Linear Tech and Altera ( ALTR - news - people ) management make clear, most of the installed base of industrial equipment is being recast, reengineered and redeployed, integrating individual networked identities into once totally stand-alone items. The technological impact on the mechanical world is moving far beyond computerizing the factory floor or putting electronics under the hood, and now encompasses high-performing broadband networks that require the best and brightest that Silicon Valley can offer.\n\nThe consumer-driven chip upturn from late 2002 through 2004--followed by a mini-uptick in front of the 2007-2008 disaster--was the flipside of the higher value-added, enterprise-fueled 1990s, a decade that itself followed major industry-wide restructuring during the preceding half-dozen years. This ebb and flow lends some confidence that the present high value-added cloud-, broadband- and industrial-denominated upturn could last another four to five years.\n\nYes, the current upturn will again be interrupted--as it was this past summer--perhaps by PCs, smartphones or even tablet computers, but today's unfolding trend suggests that a strong year or more lies ahead before investors need sweat their brow. In the interim, there remain a handful of above-average, dividend-yielding chip stocks that include best of breed semiconductor companies Linear Technology Corporation ( LLTC - news - people ), Analog Devices and Intel ( INTC - news - people ), as well as role players like Texas Instruments ( TXN - news - people ), Intersil ( ISIL - news - people ) and Vicor. Each company will report improved orders, building backlog and higher earnings outlooks early in 2011.\n\nFocusing on Linear Tech for a moment, the company has long set the margin bar, sporting the highest profit returns of any chip producer outside of a few pure design and software entities. With sales well over $1 billion, and addressing a $30 billion-plus market, Linear has focused on innovative and unique products, eschewing any thought of copying others. After deciding on what new products to develop--with first design-ins and order typically two or three years later--Linear Tech sees its analog chips begin to generate revenues at the five year mark. Pricing of that product, however, is set just under three years after the design decision, and product life cycles can run for a decade or longer.",

The humanitarian situation is at its worst, as there is no food whatsoever, no medicines, no water and no electricity. There is no communication in the area thus making matters much worse. We are also lacking in enough arms to defend the civilians. The Assad army has destroyed most of the civilian homes up to now by use of missiles from multiple missile launchers, helicopters that have attacked Baba Amr from the skies and tank shelling using mortar shells type 120mm.\n\nWe are now calling on the International Red Cross to immediately enter and remove all civilians, we place full responsibility on them in that they must enter and save the people and hand them all aid necessary to keep them alive. The families have refused to leave, thus they must be provided with aid immediately. They have refused to leave their destroyed homes, homes that have been blown up during the barbaric attacks for the last month. The number of civilians refusing to leave is around 4,000.\n\nWe warn the Assad regime against any reaction that will target civilians and we place full responsibility on the regime for the safety of the civilians who are caught in the middle of this. We warn, any action by the regime that crosses the limits and affects civilians will see a severe response from our side.\n\nWe promise you, the people of Syria, Baba Amr will remain the eye and heart of this revolution until we gain full victory. Whatever the price we have to pay and whatever we have to give up\u2026 we are returning stronger God willing.\n\nThe Guardian reports on its Middle East Live blog that a security official in Damascus told Agence France-Presse: \u201cThe Syrian army controls all of Baba Amr. The last pockets of resistance have fallen.\u201d\n\nLast week, a video report from a French photographer who was in Baba Amr during the first days of the military assault gave a vivid picture of the urban warfare between the government forces and the rebels, led by army defectors.\n\nJavier Espinosa, a correspondent for the Spanish newspaper El Mundo who was smuggled out of Baba Amr and into Lebanon this week by activists, drew attention to the plight of civilians in the neighborhood in a new Twitter update.\n\nThe French newspaper Le Figaro reports that there was again conflicting information about the safety of its correspondent in Baba Amr, Edith Bouvier, who was seriously wounded in a rocket attack last week that killed two of her colleagues, Marie Colvin and R\u00e9mi Ochlik. A member of Syria\u2019s opposition, Burhan Ghalioun, said on Thursday that Ms. Bouvier was \u201cin a safe place,\u201d before expressing some uncertainty about whether that was still the case later in the day.\n\nActivists said on Wednesday that the team that managed to smuggle Mr. Espinosa and another journalist, Paul Conroy, from Homs to Lebanon this week, was still working to get Ms. Bouvier and a second French journalist, William Daniels, to safety.\n\nA Syrian activist, writing on Twitter as Samsom Homs, said that opponents of the government now fear revenge attacks by militias supporting the government.\n\nHe also posted a link to video said to have been recorded on Wednesday by activists in two areas of central Homs, squares around an old clock and a new clock, which were filled with protesters 11 months ago, when the uprising first swept the city. Both squares were deserted and appeared to have been damaged in fighting.",

No longer the poor stepchild of the PC, it\u2019s finally catching up, matching most of the features of the PC version 5.0.\n\nIncluded in the new features are a call control bar, group video calling, the ability to search chat content, integration with the OS X Address Book, and a smaller floating contacts monitor. The only missing feature from the Windows version of Skype is its integration of the Facebook newsfeed.\n\nThe beta version of Skype for Mac OS X has been available since last November (and the PC beta version was available in September). In a blog post, Skype says it\u2019s taken the suggestions of beta users and incorporated most of them in this new version.\n\nThe centerpiece of version 5.0 is group video calling (GVC), letting 10 users vid-chat with each other. But there\u2019s a catch: You\u2019ll have to pony up for it. Group video calling is free for a week, but after that, a day pass is $4.99, or a monthly subscription is $8.99, and customer support is included.\n\nIf you\u2019re not interested in paying for group calling, you can get the rest of Skype 5.0 with a free download. That\u2019ll give you the most-desired Skype features, such as voice chat with other Skype users, one-on-one video chat and instant messaging, as well as the ability to call and text plain old telephone numbers with the purchase of SkypeOut credits. And those credits are dirt cheap compared to conventional telephone rates, especially for international calling.\n\nSo what\u2019s changed? As Skype 5.0 moves away from its beta status, its user interface has been cleaned up, with Skype responding to customer complaints about too much white space with a tighter interface. Yes, now you can hide Skype on the corner of your screen until someone calls you, a significant improvement over the beta version.\n\nThere\u2019s another catch: Users in various forums and sites are not happy with the non-beta Skype 5.0, complaining about how it still takes up too much space for what it does. Many are just sticking with the old version 2.8. If you\u2019re thinking of upgrading, you might want to keep a copy of version 2.8 handy so you can bail if necessary.\n\nSkype says the minimum system requirement for this new version is a 1GHz Intel processor, and you must be running Mac OS X 10.5.8 with 100 MB of free disk space. The good news about that premium group video calling is that although all users on a call must be running Skype 5.0 for it to work, only one of the callers must be a paying subscriber.\n\nHere\u2019s a Skype-produced video of the new version:",

    "text": "Taken together, the moves provide the strongest indication yet that Mr. McCain intends to run a far tougher campaign than the one he ran in the 2000 primary. And they come as he transitions from being a onetime maverick to a candidate seeking to gather his party around him and create an air of inevitability about his prospects for winning nomination.\n\nAs Mr. McCain assembles his team, he is also making it that much harder for his Republican challengers by scooping up a significant circle of the party\u2019s top talent.\n\nIn recent years, Mr. McCain has made a concerted effort to mend fences with Mr. Bush and reassure the Republican base that he is a reliable conservative. But his moves have focused new attention on the extent to which he may risk sacrificing the image he has long cultivated of being his own man, driven by principle rather than partisan politics.\n\nMr. McCain\u2019s advisers said he was not changing. But they were unapologetic about putting together a group dedicated to doing what it takes to reach the White House and employing lessons from his defeat at the hands of Mr. Bush in 2000.\n\n\u201cThis is about winning at the end of the day,\u201d said John Weaver, Mr. McCain\u2019s longtime senior strategist. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in a knife fight ever again, but if I am, we\u2019re going to win it.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain\u2019s representatives said he would not provide an interview.\n\nSeven years ago, Mr. McCain charmed the news media and the public with his Straight Talk Express bus tour. He had a lean operation befitting an upstart candidacy, and he regularly spoke out against attack advertising, a quaint notion in retrospect.\n\nIn the end, he ran his share of confrontational advertisements, once even leveling the ultimate Republican-to-Republican insult: that Mr. Bush was as dishonest as Bill Clinton. But he was perceived as having been knocked back on his heels by the rougher, tougher Bush campaign.\n\nNow Mr. McCain is building a larger organization, bringing together the heart of the bare-knuckled Bush crew once overseen by Karl Rove while keeping most of the advisers who ran his shoestring effort of 2000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an all-star World Wrestling Federation cage match, except that instead of fighting one another, all of the brawlers are on the same team,\u201d said Steve McMahon, a strategist for the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThere are very few people who play this game at the highest level, and on the Republican side these guys are among the best.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain has also hired Brian Jones, an adviser to Mr. Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign; Fred Davis, a media consultant for Mr. Bush in 2004; and Steve Schmidt, who oversaw Mr. Bush\u2019s 2004 war room, exploiting any tidbit that could help paint Mr. Kerry as a \u201cflip-flopper.\u201d\n\nThe hires are another signal that the 2008 primary campaign could be a combative one all around.\n\nOn the Democratic side, John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina, has wasted no time attacking Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s position on Iraq. And Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team includes strategists who invented the concept of the modern campaign war room for her husband 15 years ago. But Senator Barack Obama of Illinois drew cheers at a party gathering on Friday when he warned his fellow candidates against attacking one another.\n\nMitt Romney, a Republican and the former governor of Massachusetts, has hired Alex Castellanos, a onetime Bush strategist who also famously produced the 1990 commercial for Jesse Helms, the former North Carolina senator, in which a pair of white hands crumpled a rejection letter as a narrator said, \u201cYou needed that job and you were the best qualified, but it had to go to a minority because of a racial quota.\u201d\n\nGiven Mr. McCain\u2019s history with some of the people on his team, the evolution of his staff may present an early challenge: How does he stay true to the \u201cStraight Talk\u201d spirit of his 2000 campaign, which helped him win the stature he has now, while also engaging in the political brinkmanship it can take to win?\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is already criticizing Mr. McCain for his hires, issuing a statement this week calling them \u201ca testament to how far he\u2019s gone down the do-anything-to-win path.\u201d\n\nTony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster who is not yet allied with a candidate, said Mr. McCain was running the risk of looking \u201cpolitically expedient\u201d and of blunting his brand as \u201cSenator Straight Talk.\u201d He said the risk was highlighted by Mr. McCain\u2019s recent suggestions that he may not use the campaign finance system he has long championed.\n\nIn 2000, Mr. McCain received money from the system, which gives public financing to candidates who agree to strict spending limits. Mr. Weaver, the senior strategist, said Mr. McCain was keeping his options open because others, including Mrs. Clinton, were planning to work around the system.\n\nAs Mr. McCain\u2019s aides often point out, for all its appeal, the McCain 2000 campaign was a losing one. And they said it would be unfair to suggest that because Mr. McCain was augmenting his team he was somehow preparing to change who he was.\n\n\u201cThere are no negotiations regarding his principles,\u201d Mr. Weaver said.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, Mr. Jones, the campaign communications director, said Mr. McCain was not allowing his distaste over the Swift Boat commercials to interfere with his relationship with Stevens Reed Curcio & Potholm, with whom Mr. McCain has his own decade-long association. In addition, he said, Mr. McCain hired Mr. Nelson because of his breadth of experience in national campaigns. \u201cThe campaign,\u201d Mr. Jones said, \u201cis not going to let past contests on the battlefield limit how it\u2019s going to go after talent.\u201d\n\nPresidential politics are rich in fungible allegiances. James A. Baker III ran the primary campaigns of Gerald Ford and the elder George Bush against Ronald Reagan, only to become Mr. Reagan\u2019s chief of staff. This year, David Axelrod is serving as a senior strategist for Mr. Obama; he was a senior strategist to Mr. Edwards in his 2004 campaign.\n\n\u201cYou could dissect any campaign this way: this guy did this ad this one time,\u201d said Mr. Schriefer, the former Bush media strategist, who will run Mr. McCain\u2019s advertising team. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous history of foes becoming allies.\u201d\n\nMr. McKinnon, who led Mr. Bush\u2019s advertising group in 2004, said he saw no inconsistency in working for Mr. McCain. Mr. Bush was right for 2000, he said, and Mr. McCain is right for 2008. \u201cAt the end of the day, the campaign will be won or lost on the character of the candidate and his or her core message,\u201d Mr. McKinnon said. \u201cOf course, I believe that will be John McCain.\u201d\n\nAsked if the senator would avoid the attacks he criticized in 2000, Mr. Jones said that while Mr. McCain had yet to declare his candidacy, any campaign he ran would be \u201cconsistent with his beliefs and values.\u201d",

Katie Meili of the U.S. won the bronze in 1:05.69.\n\n\u201cTonight has been so crazy,\u201d King said. \u201cMy life is changing right now. I\u2019m a gold medalist and it\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted to be and it\u2019s an incredible feeling.\u201d\n\nSpectators booed when Efimova walked to her starting block and loudly cheered King.\n\nEfimova, a four-time world champion initially barred from competing at the Rio Games because of a prior doping violation, was added to the event after an international court ruling on Thursday. Her entry was vivid fallout from the move to exclude Russian athletes from Rio in the wake of evidence of state-sponsored drug cheating at the 2014 Sochi Games.\n\n\u201cA week ago, I didn\u2019t even know if I could race because I\u2019m Russian,\u201d Efimova said after Monday\u2019s race. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to be here.\u201d\n\nAfter posting the top time of the qualifying heats Sunday, King extended an index finger at Efimova to boast her position. The Russian responded in kind after her semifinal heat Sunday night. King responded by wagging her finger at a TV monitor showing Efimova after King narrowly secured the top qualifying time for the final.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate that we have to deal with these things in this sport,\u201d King said Sunday. She said she accepted but disagreed with the ruling allowing Efimova to swim. \u201cA level playing field would be preferred.\u201d\n\nEfimova initially was banned from the Olympics after an investigation for the World Anti-Doping Agency detailed state-sponsored cheating in Russia and the International Olympic Committee barred Russian athletes who had served prior drug bans. Efimova tested positive for a banned prescription steroid in October 2013 and was suspended 16 months, until February 2015.\n\nEfimova appealed, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport last Thursday ruled the IOC\u2019s Olympic ban \u201cunenforceable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d IOC spokesman Mark Adams said in a Monday morning news conference. \u201cWe wanted to be tougher on doping. They took that decision, they are the highest court in sport and so we accept that.\u201d\n\nAsked what he would say to swimmers upset about known cheaters competing, Adams noted that many nations\u2019 teams included athletes previously punished for doping.\n\nOfficials from FINA, swimming\u2019s governing body, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOther swimmers also expressed frustration with Efimova\u2019s inclusion.\n\nFiona Doyle, an Irish swimmer who swam in Efimova\u2019s qualifying heat and just missed qualifying for the semifinals, held back tears after the race. \u201cCheaters are cheaters,\u201d she told the Irish Times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like FINA keep going back on their word, and the IOC keep going back on their word,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd FINA caved in to (Vladimir) Putin, and that\u2019s just not fair on the rest of the athletes who are clean. Who are you supposed to trust now? They have signs all over the village saying we are a clean sport, and it\u2019s not. And I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\nIn the men\u2019s 200 meter freestyle Monday, another controversial figure took the gold medal. China\u2019s Sun Yang beat Chad le Clos swimming 1:44.65, a little more than a half second ahead of le Clos. Yang tested positive for performance enhancing drugs two years ago.\n\nMack Horton of Australia, who beat Yang in the 400-meter freestyle, called him a drug cheat. Yang said he wasn\u2019t bothered by the comment because he knows how hard he has worked.\n\nAsked about losing to someone who failed a doping test, Conor Dwyer, who won the bronze, declined to comment on the drug issue and called Sun \u201ca good guy and a great competitor.\u201d\n\n\u2014Anton Troianovski and Matthew Futterman contributed to this article.",

Thompson, its editor in chief, while Mr. Wallace was alive, the Digest periodically received overtures from would-be purchasers, but the Digest was never for sale. It is not now, either, Mr. Thompson said in response to a press query.\n\n''We simply have no interest in going public or selling to anybody,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''And we can see no circumstances in the future that would change that.''\n\nMr. Wallace, who was 91, died March 30 at his home in Mount Kisco in Westchester County. He owned 51 percent of the Digest's voting shares, compared with 49 percent held by his wife, Lila Bell Acheson Wallace, a co-founder of the Digest. Mrs. Wallace, who is 91, now owns all the voting stock, Mr. Thompson said.\n\nThe company's top officers declined to discuss what arrangements have been made for transfer of that stock at the time of Mrs. Wallace's death. The Wallaces have no children. They did say, however, that the transfer of voting shares to Mrs. Wallace had no estate tax consequences, and, further, that estate taxes would not be a problem upon Mrs. Wallace's death. Successful Formula\n\nThe Wallaces worked a publishing formula of inspiration, humor, sex, health and self-help into a small compendium of condensed articles that became the world's largest-circulated magazine. Mr. Wallace retired in 1973 as a multimillionaire, with the business also well established elsewhere in book publishing, records and educational material.\n\nThe Reader's Digest magazine has a worldwide circulation of 30 million, with advertising rates that are the envy of the publishing industry. It is introducing a new magazine in October, and has a toehold in home-computer services. Moreover, with no long-term debt, approximately $1 billion in revenues and ample profits, the Reader's Digest Association Inc., the parent company, could borrow substantial sums, if it so chose.\n\nReader's Digest is decidedly profitable, but its executives decline to give any figures. Mr. Thompson said an after-tax profits estimate of $100 million in 1979 by Business Week magazine was too high, ''nowhere near the reality.''\n\nAlong with Mr. Thompson, 53, who has been in his post since 1976, the company is headed by John A. O'Hara, 52, a native of Scotland steeped in the Digest's foreign expansion, who has been president of the Reader's Digest Association since January 1977. All departments report to Mr. O'Hara, who holds the top command. Mr. Thompson and Mr. O'Hara, along with William J. Cross, vice president and treasurer, guide the company as members of its executive committee.\n\nThe only nonofficers on Reader's Digest's 14-member board are Harold H. Helm, former chairman of Chemical Bank; Donald Platten, Chemical's present chairman, and Laurance Rockefeller, the philanthropist.\n\nIn recent years, Reader's Digest has been most active abroad, although its projects are hardly considered aggressive. Earlier this month, it added its 40th edition, in Hindi. The magazine's circulation in the United States is 18 million, with an additional 12 million abroad.\n\nThe company is introducing a new magazine, Families, in October - a condensed compendium similar to the Digest, except that it will originate one-quarter of its articles. Earlier this year, Reader's Digest entered the home-computer services field when it acquired the Source. The subscription service sells electronic information, such as United Press International and The New York Times's Information Bank, to owners of home computers.\n\nIllustrations: Photo of Reader's Digest headquarters",

Nearly 150 Palestinian and Israelis, though mostly Palestinians, were killed and many more were injured.\n\nBut the IDF said the operation allowed it to accomplish \"its pre-determined objectives for Operation Pillar of Defense, and has inflicted severe damage to Hamas and its military capabilities,\" according to a media release sent soon after the cease-fire took effect on Wednesday.\n\nThe military gains were a factor in Israel agreeing to stop the airstrikes, according to the IDF.\n\n\"These operational achievements provided the underlying framework for this evening's cease-fire agreement,\" the IDF release said.\n\nHamas fired more than 1,500 rockets, according to the IDF statement. But if Hamas started the conflict with 10,000-12,000 rockets, as Israeli and American officials believe, than there is plenty of firepower left in Gaza.\n\nIsrael also said it destroyed \"significant elements\" of Hamas rocket launching capabilities, saying \"hundreds\" were targeted, including \"dozens of long-range rocket launchers and launch sites.\"\n\nWhile Hamas used rockets with far greater reach than those launched in previous conflicts - like the Fajr-5 which can reach Jerusalem and Tel Aviv - the fighting also demonstrated the capability of Israel's defense system.\n\nThe \"Iron Dome\" system intercepted 84% of Hamas rockets fired toward Israeli civilian areas, according to the Israeli military. The IDF also said Hamas may have fired a lot of rockets but less than 7% managed to hit populated areas within Israel.\n\nThe Israeli operation targeted what the Israeli military said were command and operational control centers, senior-rank headquarters and bases.\n\nThe Israelis also said they did significant damage to the ability of Hamas to replenish its weaponry by targeting 140 smuggling tunnels, 66 \"terror tunnels\" and 26 weapon manufacturing and storage facilities. Hamas uses those tunnels to smuggle weapons in from Iran and Libya, according to Israeli and American officials. Iran's role in supplying Hamas with weapons was touted by a Hamas leader on Wednesday.\n\n\"I would like to say weapons that we have that helped us to withstand this aggression, part of it was manufactured in Gaza and part of it came from people who helped us and supported us. Iran had a role in this support in arming and training,\" Khaled Meshaal said during a press conference that aired on Aqsa television.\n\nIn an interview that aired on CNN International's 'Amanpour,\" Meshaal said Hamas seeks financial, military and other forms of support from Iran and from any state that wishes to support Hamas.\n\nThe United States has also pressed Egypt to shut down the Sinai tunnels, which are also a key source for delivering commercial goods into Gaza.\n\nIran was trying to provide Hamas with more long-range missles in the last week, according to IDF's spokeswoman.\n\n\"Even during the operation, Iran went through great efforts to try and push ahead long-range rockets into Gaza when Iran saw the effect these long-range rockets have on the Israeli population,\" Leibovich said in the Situation Room interview. Leibovich said Iran was not successful in getting the rockets into Gaza.\n\nWhite House Counterterrorism Advisor John Brennan visited the region to talk about dealing with smuggling and the security in the Sinai, a senior U.S. official told CNN's Jill Dougherty.\n\nIDF listed seven \"senior operatives\" of Hamas who were targeted.\n\nBut the Hamas spokesman claimed Israel did more damage to Gaza's civilian infrastructure than Hamas' military capabilities.\n\n\"They wanted to destroy infrastructure of Hamas, today they claim to have done so,\" Meshaal said on Wednesday.\n\n\"I don't deny they have done so much. We could count how many buildings they have destroyed, and how many offices of the media they have destroyed, and how many children they have killed, and how many journalists and how many photographers they have killed - just like you. We can count how many offices and how many buildings they have destroyed. This is their accomplishment. They have nothing else to show.\"\n\nThe preparation for a ground invasion, which never was launched, served as a dry run for Israel's military in the event an operation is ordered in the future, according to the Israelis.\n\n\"IDF soldiers, in regular and reserve military service, gathered in assembly areas and prepared for the ground operation. Their time was used for training and improving their operational capabilities,\" according to the IDF statement.\n\nBut the Israeli efforts were not without a huge cost. An \"Iron Dome\" missile costs at least $62,000, Israeli officials said. With approximately 500 fired over eight days, the cost of missiles is more than $30 million.\n\nThe \"Iron Dome\" was successful but is not a perfect shield, said one analyst.\n\n\"'Iron Dome' does have certain limits to the number of missiles it can engage,\" said Steve Zaloga, a military weapons expert with the Teal Group.\n\nFor all of Israel's declared successes, Hamas takes some lessons and victories from the battle as well. Most importantly, it does not take a lot of missiles to cause chaos.\n\n\"It doesn't take more than one or two of these things to land in a major urban center to cause political response, to cause panic and to maybe force Israel's hand into a ground operation,\" said Dan Goure, a missile defense expert with the Lexington Institute.\n\nAnother antagonist in the region, Iran, may see Israel's success as a cautionary sign should it look to Hamas to assist in retaliating if Israel strikes Iran's nuclear program, Goure said.\n\n\"Israel may be able to tolerate whatever retaliation Hamas or Hezbollah might do in the event of an attack on Iran. So Iran may have felt a little more vulnerable today than it did a week or two ago,\" Goure observed.",

    "text": "JERUSALEM \u2014 A United Nations Commission of Inquiry on last summer\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip \u2014 taking pains to be evenhanded \u2014 found that both Israel and Palestinian militants were responsible for violations of international law that could amount to war crimes. But each side interpreted the commission\u2019s long-awaited report according to its own version of the Middle East conflict.\n\nIn the 217-page report, submitted on Monday to the United Nations Human Rights Council, the two commissioners said the militants clearly wanted to sow terror among Israeli civilians, just as they said they could not find clear evidence of why Israel targeted residential buildings in Gaza late at night, risking mass civilian casualties.\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry\u2019s chairwoman, the American jurist Mary McGowan Davis, said at a Geneva news conference that the investigation had gathered testimony \u201cin a scrupulously objective fashion.\u201d\n\nStill, each side in the long-running conflict saw what it wanted in any such report: Israelis condemned it as further evidence of bias against them in the United Nations writ large, while Palestinians embraced it as further ballast in their bid to punish Israelis in the International Criminal Court \u2014 and the court of international public opinion.\n\nThe report, written by Ms. McGowan Davis and Doudou Diene, a lawyer from Senegal, said that \u201cimpunity prevails across the board\u201d regarding the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, and it called on Israel to \u201cbreak with its recent lamentable track record in holding wrongdoers accountable.\u201d\n\nAs for Palestinian armed groups, the panel cited the \u201cinherently indiscriminate nature\u201d of rockets and mortars fired at Israeli civilians, condemned the killing of people suspected of being collaborators, and said the Palestinian authorities had \u201cconsistently failed\u201d to bring violators of international law to justice.\n\nDespite the February resignation of the inquiry\u2019s original leader, William Schabas, after Israel complained of his having advised the Palestine Liberation Organization, some Israeli leaders and news organizations continued to refer to it as \u201cthe Schabas report\u201d for effect. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the document \u201cflawed and biased\u201d and said the Human Rights Council \u201chas a singular obsession with Israel.\u201d (In fact, it also has Eritrea, Sri Lanka, Syria and other countries on its agenda.)\n\nThe reaction to the report embodied Israel\u2019s mounting attacks on the United Nations in recent months, with the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Ron Prosor, saying that \u201cthe U.N. has been taken hostage by terrorist organizations, and in this battle the international community will lose.\u201d\n\nHamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, on the other hand, assessed the report as a \u201cclear condemnation\u201d of Israel that demonstrated why Israel should be held accountable for war crimes. It ignored or dismissed the report\u2019s criticism of its own actions. And Saeb Erekat, a P.L.O. leader, praised what he called \u201cthese esteemed bodies of international law.\u201d\n\nThe report said \u201cthe scale of the devastation was unprecedented\u201d in Gaza, tallying more than 6,000 airstrikes, 14,500 tank shells and 45,000 artillery shells unleashed between July 7 and Aug. 26. The hostilities also \u201ccaused immense distress and disruption to the lives of Israeli civilians,\u201d it said, counting 4,881 rockets and 1,753 mortars fired by Palestinians during that period, and extensively discussing the tunnels militants used to infiltrate Israeli territory. Of the death toll of 2,252 Palestinians, the report said 65 percent were civilians; Israel says it has documented militant activity by at least 44 percent of the dead.\n\nThe report could serve as a road map for the preliminary examination already underway by the International Criminal Court\u2019s prosecutor. The Palestinians are expected to present their own files to the court regarding Israeli crimes on Thursday.\n\nIsrael \u2014 and Hamas \u2014 refused to cooperate with the inquiry. Israel barred panel members from entering both its territory and Gaza to conduct research.\n\nMary McGowan Davis, the chairwoman of the Human Rights Council\u2019s inquiry into the 2014 battle in Gaza, said on Monday that both Israel and the Palestinians may be guilty of war crimes.\n\nThe commission\u2019s report is the latest and arguably most damning United Nations inquiry into the 2014 Gaza war. In April, a separate board of inquiry appointed by the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, found that Israeli military action had killed 44 civilians taking shelter inside United Nations schools, which it said should have been \u201cinviolable.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s report devoted more space to Israel\u2019s actions, but used similar language to address violations by both sides, and made other efforts at evenhandedness, for instance recalling how three Israeli teenagers were \u201ckidnapped and brutally murdered\u201d and then how a Palestinian teenager was \u201cviciously murdered by being burned alive.\u201d\n\nIt cited the militants\u2019 rocket attacks and tunnel infiltrations of Israeli territory first in its summary of findings. It noted that Palestinian groups issued statements saying they were trying to hit Israeli cities, and that their weapons lacked guidance systems to aim at military objectives. The panel concluded that those attacks were \u201cindiscriminate in nature,\u201d suggesting that their main goal \u201cwas to spread terror among the civilian population, in violation of international humanitarian law.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the harshest condemnation was for the August execution of 21 Gazans suspected of collaborating with Israel, which the report said definitively \u201camount to a war crime.\u201d\n\nAs for the tunnels, the commission detailed the anxiety they caused Israelis but said it \u201ccannot conclusively determine\u201d why they were built and noted that during the summer they \u201cwere only used to conduct attacks directed at\u201d Israeli military posts.\n\nThe panel sought to answer the question of whether Israel committed war crimes by painstakingly examining whether the killing of civilians was indiscriminate, whether attacks on military targets were proportional and whether it took sufficient care to prevent civilian casualties. On this, the report was particularly sharp.\n\nIsraeli forces frequently used precision-guided missiles, indicating that they were aimed at specific targets, the report said, but many of the attacks came when families were gathered to break the Ramadan fast or were asleep, increasing the likelihood of civilian deaths. In six cases that the panel looked into, they found little or no information to explain why residential buildings \u201cwhich are prima facie civilian objects immune from attack, were considered to be legitimate military objectives.\u201d\n\nIn another nine cases where militants were inside residential buildings, the panel said there were \u201cstrong indications that these attacks could be disproportionate, and therefore amount to a war crime.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s warnings to Gazans, including \u201croof-knocks\u201d in which lighter missiles were fired before deadly bombs, \u201ccannot be considered\u201d effective, the report said, because they confused residents and did not give them enough time to evacuate.\n\nLeaflets urging Gazans to leave their homes were also insufficient, the report found, because residents did not know which locations would be hit, and some 44 percent of the coastal enclave was off-limits. \u201cThese terrifying circumstances created a sense of entrapment, of having \u201cno safe place\u201d to go,\u201d it added.\n\nThe Gaza Commission of Inquiry is hardly the first to compile a mountain of facts, only to be filed away or criticized as biased. A parallel one on Syria has issued eight separate reports on suspected war crimes there, even submitting a list of names of suspects, which is kept under seal by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nSo why bother appointing these panels? Advocates point out that there is no statute of limitations on war crimes. Dozens of Bosnian immigrants to the United States are facing deportation on suspicion that they were involved in \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and other war crimes 20 years ago during the Balkan wars.\n\nThe Gaza commission will be discussed by the Human Rights Council next Monday. That will be another occasion for the allies of both sides to use the report\u2019s findings to renew the debate.",
    "summary": "The report said \u201cimpunity prevails across the board\u201d regarding the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, but also cited the \u201cinherently indiscriminate nature\u201d of rockets fired at Israeli civilians."

    "text": "The rules around the immigration and employment status of fishermen are complex and there is considerable confusion among those wanting to use migrant workers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) as to what is required.\n\nThe Irish Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation told us when we asked last month that to work on an Irish fishing vessel that operates within Ireland\u2019s 12-mile territorial waters, or to work on trawlers or on the dock while they are in Irish ports, non-EEA migrants need an Irish work permit. But since 2006, non-EEA seafarers have been not been eligible to apply for Irish work permits.\n\nIn 2009 the Irish government prepared a draft scheme for non-EEA permits for fishing because the industry said it couldn\u2019t find enough Irish workers, but it was ditched after the 2008 crash to protect local employment. Some Asian migrant workers we met told us they had applied for permits but had been refused.\n\nHowever, the department later told us that as all seafarers work in a self-employed capacity, the employment permit legislation does not apply to them. We asked the department to clarify this apparent contradiction but it declined to do so.\n\nIrish legal experts advise that non-EEA nationals wanting to enter Ireland must present themselves to Irish immigration. Those wanting to stay should have an Irish visa. Those crossing the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland without presenting to immigration are in breach of the law. Anyone helping them to do so could be regarded as facilitating illegal immigration.\n\nNon-EEA crew trying to enter Ireland without permits or visas have been turned back by Irish immigration.\n\nThere are special internationally agreed arrangements for seafarers who need to transit through countries to join vessels that operate in international waters outside the 12-mile limit. They were designed for crew on merchant vessels who stay at sea for months, not for fishing boats, but it is these loopholes that are being exploited by some to get crew from Africa and Asia.\n\nCrew may be given transit visas, usually of only 48 hours, to pass through a country straight out on to a vessel. To get transit visas, fishermen must have contracts of employment showing their terms and offering a guarantee of repatriation by the employer if there are problems. In other words, they cannot be self-employed.\n\nThere is also a UN ILO convention \u2013 C108 \u2013 that allows seafarers to transit countries to join vessels working in international waters using recognised seafarers\u2019 identity documents instead of transit visas. They may not leave the vessel if it enters territorial waters or comes in to harbour except with express permission on each occasion. The C108 only applies to nationals of countries that have ratified the convention \u2013 although Ghana has, Egypt and the Philippines have not. The ILO confirmed to us that C108 in any case applies to merchant seamen, not fishermen.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of a transit visa in maritime immigration is for entering and leaving a country. It is not for working purposes. Fishing in territorial waters is a work activity, not a transit,\u201d explained leading maritime immigration law expert Diego Archer at Fragomen Worldwide.\n\nIrish fishermen have traditionally been paid by way of a share of the money made from the catch, divided in the proportions agreed by the owner. Share fishermen have been considered self-employed. Those who are self-employed are responsible for their own tax and insurance. They are not subject to work permit requirements or working condition legislation. Simply declaring someone self-employed or a share fisherman does not, however, get employers out of their obligations if workers are in reality employed. How a worker is classified in law depends on what degree of autonomy they have. If someone receives a fixed wage, and is under the control and direction of someone, they are more likely to be an employee in law than a worker (intermediary category) or self-employed.",

    "text": "Now that ABRAHAM LINCOLN is to be President of the United States during the next term, all parties are equally interested in understanding his precise position on the great question by which the country has been, and still is, so profoundly agitated. During the canvass it suited the purposes of his opponents to represent him as an Abolitionist -- as a man utterly reckless of the rights and interests of the Southern States, and disposed to make war upon Slavery, wherever it exists, regardless less of its effect upon the prosperity of the country and the stability of the Union. It was to little purpose that his friends denied the truth of these representations; what they said was charged to the natural zeal of political partisans. But now that the election is over, and the result fixed, we have all one common interest in ascertaining upon what principles his Administration will probably be conducted.\n\nFortunately his public speeches, made long before his name had ever been mentioned in connection with the Presidency, afford ample material for such a judgment. And we are quite sure we shall do the public an essential service by publishing the following extracts from those speeches, giving his views upon each of the prominent points to which the Slavery agitation has given rise:\n\nMR. LINCOLNS DECLARARATION OF THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT.\n\nFrom Mr. Lincoln's Speech at Sprinfield, June 17, 1858.\n\nMR. PRESIDENT, AND GENTLEMEN OF THE CONVETION: If we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could better, judge what to do, and how to do it. We are now far into the fifth year, since a policy was initiated, with the avowed object, and confident promise, of putting an end to Slavery agitation. Under the operation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly, augmented. In my opinion, it will not cease, until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. \"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\" I believe this Government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved -- I do not expect the house to fall -- but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the opponents, of Slavery will arreest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new -- North as well as well as South.\n\nMR. LINCOLN'S EXPLANATIONS OF HIS MEANING IN THIS DECLARATION.\n\nFrom Mr. Lincoln's Reply to Douglas, July 10, 1858.\n\nIn this paragraph which I have quoted in your hearing, and to which I ask the attention of all, Judge DOUGLAS thinks he discovers great political heresy. I want your attention particularly to what he has inferred from it. He says I am in favor of making all the States of this Union uniform. He draws this inference from the language. I have quoted to you. He says that I am in favor of making war by the North upon the Smith for the extermination of Slavery; that I am also in favor of inviting (as he expresses it) the South to war upon the North, for the purpose of nationalizing Slavery. Now, it is singular enough, if you will carefully read that passage over, that I did not say that I was in favor of anything in it. I only said what I expected would take place. I made a prediction only -- it may have been a foolish one perhaps.I did not even say that I desired that Slavery should be put in course of ultimate extinction. I do now, however, so there need be no longer any difficulty about that. It may be written down in the great speech.\n\nGentlemen, Judge DOUGLAS informed you that this speech of mine was probably carefully prepared. I admit that it was. I am not master of language; I have not a fine education; I am not capable of entering into a disquisition upon dialectics, as I believe you call it; but I do not believe the language I employed bears any such construction as Judge Douglas puts upon it. But I don't care about a quibble in regard to words. I know what I meant, and I will not leave this crowd in doubt, if I can explain it to them, what I really meant in the use of that, paragraph.\n\nI am not, in the first place, unaware that this Government has endured eighty-two years, half slave and half free. I know that I am tolerably well acquainted with the history of the country, and I know that it has endured eighty-two years, half slave and half free. I believe -- and that is what I meant to allude to there -- I believe it has endured, because during all that time, until the introduction of the Nebraska bill, the public mind did rest in the belief that Slavery was in course of ultimate extinction. That was what gave us the rest that we had through that period of eighty-two years; at least, so I believe. I have always hated Slavery, I think as much as any Abolitionist -- I have been an Old Line Whig -- I have always hated it, but I have always been quiet about it until this new era of the introduction of the Nebraska bill began. I always believed that everybody was against it, and that it was in course of ultimate extinction. [Pointing to Mr. BROWNING, who stood near by.] BROWNING thought so; the great mass of the nation have rested in this belief that Slavery was in course of ultimate extinction. They had reason so to believe. The adoption of the Constitution and its attendant history led the people to believe so; and that such was the belief of the framers of the Constitution itself, why did these old men, about the time of the adoption of the Constitution, decree that Slavery should not go into the new Territory, where it had not already gone? Why declare that within twenty years the African Slave-trade, by which slaves are supplied, might be cut off by Congress? Why were all these acts? I might enumerate more of these acts -- but enough. What were they but a clear indication that the framers of the Constitution intended and expected the ultimate extinction of that institution? And now, when I say, as I said in my speech that Judge DOUGLAS has quoted from, when I say that I think the opponents of Slavery will resist the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction, I only mean to say, that they will place it where the founders of this Government originally placed it.",

    "text": "Truecar, the latest Internet startup to carve a niche in automotive retailing, is running into roadblocks as it tries to expand.\n\nThe Santa Monica, California-based company is scrambling to avoid a host of legal and public relations pitfalls so it can expand its car-buying service, which it claims already accounts for some 2.8% of all retail auto sales. That proportion would translate to about more than 364,000 sales a year, or about $110 million in revenue, for Truecar.\n\nAs Fortune reported, visitors to Truecar\u2019s website can survey information about cars, including recent prices at which similar vehicles sell, and then may solicit quote from dealers. If a dealer makes a sale to a shopper based on a lead from Truecar, the dealer pays the company $300. Other automotive sites, such as Edmunds.com, gain revenue by selling leads to dealers, irrespective of whether those leads turn into sales.\n\nTruecar said it has suspended operations in Colorado after the state opened an investigation in December into whether the company was complying with regulations covering advertisers and whether it had the required licenses to act as an agent for car buyers. On Wednesday, the company said it adjusted its billing practice, dropping the fee and charging a subscription instead, to comply with laws in Virginia and all others prohibiting \u201cbird-dogging,\u201d or finding customers for dealers.\n\nAt the heart of Truecar\u2019s troubles are a multitude of state laws designed to protect the franchises of automobile dealers and to control unbridled competition among dealers to sell vehicles. Some customers have complained to states that the car they expected to buy wasn\u2019t available at a dealer, as they expected.\n\nThe company has been quick to respond. \u201cTruecar is committed to never putting our dealer partners at risk, which means we will always work closely with regulators to identify a workable solution or suspend service,\u201d said Scott Painter, Truecar founder and CEO, in a prepared statement.\n\nOver the past two decades the Internet has become a significant factor in retailing, though more so in categories like appliances and apparel than in vehicles. Franchise agreements stipulate that customers in the U.S. must buy from dealers, rather than online. Hence, ventures like Edmunds.com and Kelly Blue Book have built websites that allow shoppers to find information about cars and prices, as well as to solicit quotes from nearby dealers.\n\nEdmunds and Kelly typically sell sales leads to dealers at a fixed price or through subscriptions, irrespective of how many of them turn into sales. The leads are created when on-line shoppers fill in forms and declare their interest in buying a vehicle. Truecar broke from the more common model by giving leads to dealers free of charge, instead imposing the $300 fee only on those that turned into sales.\n\nAvi Steinlauf, chief executive officer of Edmunds.com said: \u201cEdmunds.com\u2019s mission is to inform and educate consumers and to create realistic expectations about the retail process. In the process, we do not impose prices on dealers, we do not create false consumer expectations, and we do not break the law.\u201d\n\nRather than charge dealers according to the number of leads, Edmunds.com recently modified its pricing model. Edmunds.com now sells access to its leads via a subscription fee to its service.\n\nHonda Motor Co. HMC has told its U.S. dealers that it will withdraw advertising support monies from any dealers that advertise \u201cbelow invoice\u201d pricing of its cars. Honda says \u201cbelow invoice\u201d violates its standard covenant with dealers who accept advertising support.\n\nHonda regards Truecar as an advertising platform and says Honda dealers have used the buying service to advertise below-invoice pricing of Honda vehicles. John Mendel, executive vice president of Honda\u2019s U.S.-based sales subsidiary, said \u201cwe never tell our dealers with whom they may chose to do business. However. we are passionate about protecting our customers and the Honda Brand and will not support any actions to the contrary.\u201d\n\nPenske Automotive PAG , with more than 150 dealers in the U.S., has elected as a matter of policy not to transact sales using Truecar. Group 1 Automotive, another dealer chain, said it has instructed dealers to stop sharing pricing information with Truecar. According to Group 1, In some instances Truecar gained access to specific descriptions of transactions and precisely the amounts customers paid for cars. Edmunds and Kelly, by contrast, only use an average of a large number of sales to tell visitors to its websites an approximate value of specific models.\n\nThe Truecar initiative is under intense regulatory scrutiny in several states and the subject of vigorous debate among dealers and manufacturers. How the numerous hassles are resolved could have a bearing on how customers will shop for their next cars.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly calculated the number of annual car sales that Truecar has likely arranged, based on the company\u2019s claim of a 2.8% share of the market. This calculation has been corrected.",

    "text": "For generations, the American people have had a standing deal with their Presidents: Go ahead and mess with the prime-time lineup once in a while, interrupt Who\u2019s the Boss, Seinfeld, NCIS: Los Angeles, or whatever. But you better make it count. You better have something new to say. And when it comes to speeches of national security, you better leave the impression that you have this thing under control.\n\nOn Tuesday night, President Obama decided to test this unspoken pact. For 16 minutes from the East Room, he took over the nation\u2019s televisions to repeat the same complex and contradictory case for bombing Syria that he has been making for two weeks, even though he acknowledged at the end, there is no longer an imminent need for the country to make a decision. He delayed the start of America\u2019s Got Talent to announce he would be delaying a congressional vote.\n\nIt was a fitting turn of events, given the way the Syria crisis has played out over the past month. Three times now, Obama has been forced to announce a major pivot in his Syria policy, as he has been tossed about by global events and his own shifting judgments. First, his staff announced that the country was moving to war footing, days after a terrible chemical-weapons attack in Syria. Then, on the eve of an attack, Obama announced that he had decided this war was not one he should start alone. Finally Tuesday, on the eve of forcing a vote from Congress over that war, he announced no vote would be needed anytime soon, given diplomatic maneuverings by Vladimir Putin.\n\n(MORE: Watch Obama\u2019s Syria Speech)\n\nAlmost as soon as the President started to speak, his staff was playing defense on Twitter, pushing back against journalistic insta-reactions that judged the speech as a rehash of old talking points. \u201cPresidents don\u2019t ask for time to address columnists who follow every minute of the news,\u201d wrote White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer in one tweet. \u201cIt\u2019s for the public that doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTo date, that task of winning over the low-attention-span public has not been going well. Over the past week, American opinion has hardened against the strike, by a rough margin of 2 to 1. And Obama has found himself hampered by rationales that are so nuanced as to appear impenetrable to someone not paying careful attention.\n\nThe problems were on display once again in prime time. He said he would not launch a \u201cpinprick strike in Syria,\u201d just before he described what he did want: A \u201climited strike\u201d that would \u201csend a message.\u201d He evoked in graphic detail the humanitarian horror of children dying from chemical weapons, just after saying \u201cwe cannot resolve someone else\u2019s civil war,\u201d which has killed and will likely continue to kill thousands of children with regular bullets and bombs. \u201cI\u2019ve spent four-and-a-half years working to end wars, not to start them,\u201d he said, in a speech about starting a new one.\n\nAt the core of Obama\u2019s argument is a noble and simple goal: to maintain the global prohibition on the use of weapons of mass destruction. But that goal depends on an international resolve that has been lacking, and on an American President who can marshal enormous forces against violators. Citing other noble and simple goals, Obama has declined to play that role so far. He holds on to the idea that his own powers to decide should be limited, and that his powers of reason can persuade a war-weary world to do what it doesn\u2019t want to do.\n\n(MORE: 3 Things Obama Must Accomplish in Syria Speech)\n\nSo rather than tell the country how it is, with all the pomp and power of his office, he chose to ask the nation\u2019s favor. Instead of an Oval Office address, from the seat of American power, he spoke in front of a giant red carpet in the main hall of the White House, a decorative room that he had to traverse alone twice, in long awkward walks to and from the camera. \u201cI believe we should act,\u201d he said at the end of his speech. Not \u201cWe must act.\u201d Or \u201cNow is the time to act.\u201d Just, he believes.\n\nInstead of asking the American people directly to support his decision, he asked the American people to engage in complex puzzlers after viewing videos of the chemical attacks online. \u201cWhat kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas and we choose to look the other way?\u201d he said, a question that even foreign policy experts would be hard pressed to answer with any accuracy. It has certainly happened before \u2014 in 1988 when Saddam Hussein gassed Iraqi Kurds \u2014 with ambiguous international consequences that remain the subject of much debate.\n\nFrom the beginning of his rise to national office, the rap on Obama has been, for good and ill, that there is no binary choice he does not want to find a way to transcend. That transcendence, the idea that he could unite the country, got him elected President the first time, and it has helped steer him through a number of delicate foreign policy decisions, from Afghanistan, where he surged troops while announcing withdrawal dates, to the Arab Spring, where he supported democracy in some countries more than others.\n\nBut the problem of Syria may be showing the limit of this instinct. He wants to launch military strikes in retribution for the death of some innocent children and not others. He wants Congress to approve his action even though he may still act alone. He wants to maintain a war footing even as a new diplomatic solution appears on the horizon. They are all intellectually defensible positions. But it may just be that the people who tuned in Tuesday night, between the first and second hours of So You Think You Can Dance, were looking for a President to lead the country, not a man hoping to reason with it.\n\nMORE: Chaos Reigns in Congress as Syrian Military Strike Slips to Plan B",

Mar, the new Museu de Arte do Rio, is presenting a bonkers group show springing from the unlikely meeting, in 1929, of performer Josephine Baker and architect Le Corbusier. According to multiple biographers, the pair had an affair during their time in Brazil. The curators take an expansive view, presenting both historical documentation and parallel projects by artists and performers, including Grace Jones. Until 17 August.

At the 8th Berlin Biennale curator Juan Gait\u00e1n is showcasing art that privileges archival materials, historical oddments and cross-cultural exchange \u2013 such as a large display by Wolfgang Tillmans, which includes both photographs and consumerist junk. Most of the biennial takes place in the western suburb of Dahlem, far from the galleries and bars of East Berlin. Until 3 August. Details: berlinbiennale.de\n\nIf you're taking a stroll through El Retiro, Madrid's superb central park, make sure to stop at the lakeside Palacio de Cristal. The French artist Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster has refashioned the 19th-century greenhouse as the \"Splendide Hotel\", an imaginary resort complete with antique rocking chairs and mysteriously abandoned top hat and boots. She borrowed the name from a hotel in which Marcel Proust stayed, and just like his novels, her installation is a gathering place for those adrift on the sea of time. Until 19 October.

This summer Bozar, the city's main cultural institute, is giving its galleries over to Micha\u00ebl Borremans, one of the leading figures of Belgium's resurgent figurative painting scene.

The report found that the tactics used had ultimately proved ineffective.\n\nMitchell challenged the report's findings on Tuesday, saying enhanced interrogation tactics had proven useful in eliciting important snippets of information from suspected terrorists. He added that he wouldn't classify waterboarding as torture.\n\n\"If [waterboarding] was torture, they wouldn't have had to pass a law in 2015 outlawing it. Because torture's already illegal,\" Mitchell said, referring to a 2015 law that limits government interrogation techniques to those listed in the Army Field Manual, which details humane methods of interrogation and does not include waterboarding.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said in the past that he would like to implement waterboarding and \"a hell of a lot worse\" because \"torture works.\" Trump indicated in November that his pick for Secretary of Defense, Marine Gen. James Mattis, convinced him to rethink his stance on waterboarding.\n\nReinstating waterboarding would not be easy.

    "text": "On Friday, we were talking about why the nuclear industry isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t satisfied with the $18.5 billion in loan guarantees that the Energy Department is opening up for proposals. And that reminded me of a meeting I slipped into on Capitol Hill in mid-May that was organized by the Heritage Foundation, whose nuclear energy expert, Jack Spencer, used to work for Babcock and Wilcox, a maker of nuclear plant equipment. He had invited Michael Metzner, senior vice president and treasurer for Exelon Corporation, and Caren Byrd, executive director of Morgan Stanley's investment banking division, to speak. There were two or three dozen congressional staff members there.\n\n\"The economics have never been stronger,\" Metzner said about the nuclear business, \"but they are not strong enough to incentivize what this country needs with respect to nuclear.\" He noted that a single 1,500 megawatt nuclear plant could cost anywhere from $6 billion to $8 billion and take a decade to build. For many companies, that's half their market capitalization. \"No management team is going to bet the company on a single project,\" Metzner said.\n\nByrd chimed in, saying that banks are very wary about sinking money into new nuclear plants. During the last wave of nuclear plant construction, she noted, about 100 units were cancelled and she said that investors \"have very long memories.\" Unlike Metzner, she was cautious about putting a price tag on new nuclear plants, saying she had seen numbers ranging from $3,000 a kilowatt hour to $8,000. The upper end of that range would make Metzner's model 1,500 megawatt plant a $12 billion project.\n\nThe answer to this problem? The federal government, of course. The federal loan guarantees - which the DOE noted were \"backed by the full faith and credit of the United States\" - would move all the financing risk from the banks and put it on the federal government. How much that will cost taxpayers depends entirely on how many of the plants end up going bankrupt. (While the loan guarantee number is huge, taxpayers would be on the hook only if projects went bankrupt or were never completed.) As Byrd noted, last time that included 100 units. Will the industry be smarter this time around?\n\nMetzner said that the nuclear industry doesn't expect the federal government to underwrite all of the plants the industry hopes to build.\n\nOnly \"the first dozen or more.\" Then, he said, financial markets \"will step up\" and start lending on their own to build new nuclear plants. What he didn't mention was that the first dozen nuclear plants would require a minimum of about $75 billion in loan guarantees, and perhaps as much as $150 billion depending on the cost of the plants.\n\nI wish I had a nickel for every person with a great solution to the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy needs who just needed a few billion dollars of federal support to get going.",

    "text": "At a meeting punctuated by jeers and boos, the board that runs Brooklyn Bridge Park voted Tuesday to erect two apartment towers side-by-side in the park despite opposition by community groups and local elected officials.\n\nSoon after the vote, Richard F. Ziegler, a lawyer who has lived near the park for many years, rose to warn the board not to move ahead. \u201cThere is about to be a lawsuit and I will be the litigator,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ziegler said he would be representing the Brooklyn Heights Association on a pro-bono basis. He said that if the lease agreement were signed, the city might incur liabilities to the developer.\n\nThe board voted 12-4 to approve leases for each of the sites, with Councilman Stephen Levin, two directors representing other local elected officials, and one of four representatives of Gov. Andrew Cuomo voting against. Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2019s appointees all voted in favor.\n\nWhile union activists were on hand to support the plan, most of the hundreds who attended the meeting in downtown Brooklyn opposed it. Some had with signs saying, \u201cPark, Not Condos.\u201d Members of the public weren\u2019t permitted to speak until after the vote.\n\n\u201cPerhaps deafened by the volume of the opposition, the Board has failed to consider the community, local elected officials, the best interests of the park and the rules that govern it,\u201d said Democratic state Sen. Daniel Squadron in remarks read for him at the meeting.\n\nUnder the plan, a 28-story, market-rate luxury condo tower would rise near Pier 6 in the park. Next door, a 155-foot-high rental building would have 40 market-rate apartments and 100 apartments designed to be affordable to low- and moderate-income households. The development team is headed by RAL Development Services.\n\nRegina Myer, president of the park, said the two towers are the final component of the park\u2019s plan to pay for its operation. \u201cAt the same time,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re bringing affordable housing to an area of the city that sorely needs it, and providing good union jobs in the process.\u201d\n\nThe fight over whether to put up the towers in the narrow, 1.3-mile long park that winds along the East River goes back at least a decade. The original plan by the city and the state included a requirement that the park pay for its operation and maintenance with revenue from commercial developments.\n\nBut park foes say they were assured that the apartment buildings wouldn\u2019t be built\u2014if the money wasn\u2019t needed to pay for the park. They cite several park documents to support their contention.\n\nInstead, they want the two sites preserved as open space, since a surging real-estate market from other projects inside the park, including three nearing completion, will produce enough revenue into the foreseeable future.\n\nMs. Myer said the high costs of preserving the thousands of rotting pilings that hold up the park over the next 50 years would require revenue from the new building.\n\nThe de Blasio administration added a layer of complexity when it decided that the housing in the park should include affordable units that would be subsidized by luxury development. This reduced the amount of revenue the park will receive from the project.\n\nPark officials disclosed Tuesday that the developer would make an initial $101 million lease payment for the condo building. But because most rents in the other building are low, the park agreed to accept only $3 million in an initial lease payment on it.\n\nLast year, to settle a lawsuit by opponents, the city agreed to submit a series of changes in the overall project plan to the state for approval, including specific authorization that affordable housing be permitted.\n\nBut last month, after the state didn\u2019t act on the city\u2019s plan, citing potential conflicts of interest between the developer selected and the mayor, the city decided to move ahead on its own without state approval.\n\nIn a letter to the park on Monday, Howard Zemsky, president of Empire State Development, which is charged with reviewing the park plan, said that the current project plan \u201cdoes not prohibit the inclusion of affordable residential units.\u201d\n\nMr. Ziegler said that Mr. Zemsky\u2019s statement was carefully worded and didn\u2019t address the question of past assurances that housing wouldn\u2019t be built in the park if not needed to pay for it.\n\nWrite to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com",

    "text": "Jon Huntsman suspended more than just his campaign this week. He also put an end to any hope the GOP had of making strides in the Latino community.\n\nAnd despite the stereotypes, because of the Obama administration\u2019s policies, there really was hope. The administration has increased the number of deportations to nearly 400,000 people a year since taking office, according to ABC News. Likewise, in Secretary Janet Napolitano\u2019s annual report to Congress, she describes the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s efforts to be at \u201crecord highs.\u201d President Obama\u2019s first term has featured twice the number of deportations as George W. Bush\u2019s by instituting a systematic approach to immigration enforcement not seen since the infamous days of \u201cOperation Wetback,\u201d a program in which President Dwight Eisenhower deported over a million Mexican nationals, among them American citizens.\n\nOne might think this would be an opportunity for the GOP to make inroads with the Latino community, but the Republicans seem confident they can sit idly by as Latinos simply run into their arms. The GOP claims economics are Latinos\u2019 most important issue, but with over half of Hispanics within a generation of the immigrant experience, migration is also a profound issue (and one with profound economic consequences). And on that issue, most of the GOP candidates have done little to distinguish themselves.\n\nBut Huntsman was different. He was perhaps the only candidate who managed not to offend Latinos throughout the primary. Huntsman rightfully saw the wall on our southern border as repugnant to American values. By arguing for tough border control, yet also supporting in-state tuition for the children of unauthorized residents, Huntsman was able to conceptually distinguish the dangers of an unmanaged border from the benefits of those who came in search of a better life.\n\nHuntsman also comes from the same Utah Mormon milieu that produced the Utah Compact, a set of principles endorsed by civic and business leaders, and the LDS Church, that asks politicians to \u201cadopt reasonable policies addressing immigrants in Utah.\u201d The Utah Compact also opposes a policy that unnecessarily separates families, a significant acknowledgement of the harm our immigration laws do to Hispanic families.\n\nPerhaps most important, Huntsman differentiated himself from other Republicans as the only cosmopolitan who was comfortable with diversity. A former ambassador to China, he has direct experience with diversity in languages and customs. As a person fluent in Chinese, he saw diversity as an advantage rather than a threat. Latinos are familiar with the benefits of bilingualism, and as we continue to engage and compete in a global environment, it will become increasingly important to the success of our economy.\n\nBut now the remaining candidates only inflame the underlying hostility against minorities in the GOP\u2019s base. To make strides with Latinos, they\u2019ll have to counteract that and support a more humane approach to immigration. And this is not just about making friends \u2014 it\u2019s about winning elections.\n\nIf the GOP doesn\u2019t incorporate Latinos in its base, it won\u2019t hold power for decades to come. That\u2019s not just my opinion. It\u2019s also John McCain\u2019s. Looking into the future, he told Chuck Todd: \u201cI think that if not this election cycle, the demographics are that Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, even Texas will all be in play.\u201d\n\nThe non-Huntsman candidates reflect an old world mentality when it comes to Latinos. The contest for the Republican presidential nomination has been a race to the xenophobic bottom. Each candidate has tried to show his bona fides by demonstrating his hostility toward minorities.\n\nWhich brings us to Mitt Romney, who has been quick to remind Latinos of his family\u2019s Mexican heritage. Romney has been consistently hostile toward Latinos. On the same week the GOP launched its outreach efforts into the Hispanic community, Romney flaunted the endorsement of Kris Kobach, a central character in the anti-immigrant wave of laws in Arizona and Alabama. Kobach is promoting a system so ominous and hostile that it would force immigrants and their families to \u201cself-deport.\u201d Romney has also promised to veto the Dream Act if Congress passes it.\n\nThis rhetoric is having a debilitating effect on the GOP\u2019s ability to get its message across to Latinos. A polling firm that specializes in Latino political attitudes, Latino Decisions, has been tracking Latinos\u2019 trust of the political parties as well as their views on how well the parties are reaching out to them. In their surveys, Latino Decisions asks: \u201cWho do you trust more to make the right decisions\u201d regarding several important issues, such as the economy, housing, immigration and education (you\u2019ll see each category listed along the X axis of the graph below). They also ask whether the parties are \u201ccurrently doing a good job of reaching out to Hispanics.\u201d\n\nWhat the surveys found: While Latinos are less satisfied with the Democratic Party\u2019s efforts to reach out to them, they still overwhelmingly trust the party to address issues that are important to them. By contrast, Latinos\u2019 low trust of the GOP has been consistent. Under no relevant issue did they show any affinity for the GOP, but despite their distaste for President Obama\u2019s immigration policies, Latinos are pleased with Democrats.\n\nIf the GOP is to push back against numbers like these, it will need to recruit Hispanics themselves to lead the party forward.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though the GOP is lacking conservative-minded Latino leaders. Senator Marco Rubio and Governors Brian Sandoval and Susana Martinez are all present. But they will occasionally need to break ranks with the party message if they are to move the GOP in a direction that does not view Latino cultures as a threat. The next time one of their colleagues suggests shooting immigrants like feral pigs, they should be the first and loudest to object.\n\nPerhaps the Republican nominee can salvage his relationship with Latinos by inviting Rubio to be his running mate. While Rubio is of Cuban descent and still relatively unknown by Hispanics, he may be able to build a relationship \u2014 however superficial \u2014 with Latinos. His comfort with bilingualism, charming personality and strong relationship with the GOP base make him an ideal candidate.\n\nAs a descendent of refugees, Rubio is the beneficiary of immigration policies designed to maximize his contribution to the country. But his message so far has been difficult to pin down. While Rubio blames the crop of individual states\u2019 stringent anti-immigration laws on the federal government\u2019s inability to fix the system, he has also called on the party to tone down the rhetoric.\n\nWith Huntsman gone, the GOP has said good-bye to an important potential bridge into the Hispanic community. With options dwindling, a Vice-President Marco Rubio could be the GOP\u2019s best option in a sea of dwindling opportunities.",
    "summary": "With John Huntsman out of the race, the GOP's options to appeal to Hispanics in 2012 have narrowed even further. Picking Marco Rubio as vice-presidential nominee may be the only move that can salvage the party's chances with Latinos."

    "text": "WHEN a straight-A student starts bringing home report cards riddled with Cs, it\u2019s cause for concern.\n\nIn much the same way, lower grades on the safety report cards of new vehicles \u2014 an expected result of changes in the crash-test regimen used to rate vehicles under the government\u2019s New Car Assessment Program \u2014 could incite serious hand-wringing by new-car buyers.\n\nThe scoring system, which takes effect with 2011 models, is likely to sow confusion in dealership showrooms, where shoppers have grown accustomed to advertisements trumpeting high marks \u2014 five-star safety rating! \u2014 in the various tests.\n\nAnother aspect of the changes promises to confound shoppers: there is a good chance that some 2011 vehicles they are considering will have earned fewer stars \u2014 despite improvements in crash protection \u2014 than similar models from previous years. It\u2019s a situation familiar to parents who have wondered why their teenager\u2019s A+ in history class last fall became a B- this semester.\n\nIn truth, the exams have become much tougher with the addition of a second type of side-impact crash. Also among the changes for 2011 are new test dummies and revised injury criteria for existing front- and side-impact tests, which are otherwise unchanged.\n\nBecause it will be years before all vehicles can be evaluated under the new system, consumers can look forward to labored explanations of crash-performance ratings by sales personnel for some time to come. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it will conduct an extensive public education campaign through its Web site, Safercar.gov, and other outlets, but it is unclear how many consumers that effort will reach.\n\nRegulators are revising the star system partly to deal with a situation that one Transportation Department official called \u201cgrade inflation.\u201d With so many vehicles receiving five stars, especially in frontal crash testing, the program offers little guidance to help safety-conscious shoppers choose the new vehicle that will make them feel best protected. It is as if the cars are all from Lake Wobegon, Garrison Keillor\u2019s made-up community where \u201call the children are above average.\u201d\n\nIn at least one way, the government is trying to make the test results easier to grasp. Vehicles will now receive a single overall star rating that summarizes the different grades for front, side and rollover crashes.\n\nAt the same time, earning a five-star rating will get tougher. In the new side-impact test, the vehicle collides with a 10-inch-diameter vertical pole at 20 miles per hour. The impact is at a 75-degree angle, with the contact point on the driver\u2019s door behind the front windshield pillar. Crashes of this type \u2014 typically into a tree \u2014 are not the most common in the real world, but they are the most dangerous single-vehicle accident, said Stephen T. Kozak, global safety chief engineer at Ford.\n\nIn addition to conducting this test with a dummy of 50th percentile male size, the crashes will also be done with a 5th percentile dummy, representing a 97-pound female driver who would be more susceptible to injury.\n\nToday\u2019s side-impact test is conducted by running a 3,015-pound trolley with a wide, deformable surface into the driver\u2019s side of the tested vehicle at 38 m.p.h. The pole test is far more demanding because the contact area is so much smaller; the new test is expected to result in side-curtain air bags being installed in virtually all vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe newly overhauled five-star rating system significantly raises the bar on safety,\u201d Ron Medford, acting deputy director of N.H.T.S.A., said.\n\nIn the first year under the new system, only 20 percent of a manufacturer\u2019s vehicles will need to comply with the stricter rules, but the requirement ramps up to 100 percent compliance in 2014.\n\nCars are already much safer than they once were. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an industry-financed research group, 25,428 passenger vehicle occupants were killed in car and light-truck crashes in 2008, a 17 percent reduction from 1975. A majority of those fatal accidents, 52 percent, resulted from front crashes, but 28 percent \u2014 about 7,000 deaths \u2014 were from side impacts.\n\nMore rigorous testing standards could further reduce fatalities \u2014 and help consumers sort out which cars are the safest.\n\n\u201cN.H.T.S.A.\u2019s current crash test is fairly meaningless,\u201d said David Champion, senior director of Consumer Reports\u2019 auto test division. \u201cEvery car gets a four- or five-star rating in frontal crashes, so there isn\u2019t much differentiation. To the consumer, every car looks pretty safe.\u201d\n\nMr. Champion said a more stringent rating system would result in very few vehicles getting five stars and would also spur development of new safety technology.\n\nDavid Zuby, senior vice president for vehicle research at the insurance institute, agrees that there is some potential for confusion with the new rules. \u201cBut you have to balance that against the potential to provide safer cars to the public,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pole-impact test will result in increased head protection in collisions, Mr. Zuby said. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s no requirement for air bags that protect the head, and the pole test is basically a way to require that cars provide that level of protection.\u201d",

    "text": "CalicoDuke of York's, London WC2\n\nOliver Twist Lyric Hammersmith, London W6\n\nThe Skin of Our TeethYoung Vic, London SE1\n\nIt's hard to decide what's more irritating in Michael Hastings's new play: the facetious dialogue or the skittering structure which denies the play a focus. What's saddest is that it takes a fascinating true life as its subject, and wastes it.\n\nIt's 20 years since Tom and Viv , Hastings's play about T.S. Eliot's first, disturbed wife, was staged. Now he has lit on another troubled attendant on a Modernist writer. In his account, Lucia Joyce, while working with her father James Joyce in Paris, was fascinated by her parents' sexual relationship, and obsessed by her father's secretary, Samuel Beckett, with whom she constructed a fantasy marriage. Prone to setting things on fire, and given to roaring abuse, she was possibly a schizophrenic, possibly a Tourette's sufferer. She spent her life in and out of psychiatric care.\n\nMuddling fact and fiction, Hastings has concocted a mixture of the banal and the unfathomable. You'll not find it hard to recognise Joyce (a bluff Dermot Crowley): he's the wordy one who asks his daughter's companion: 'Did you spreadleg and cocktumble my cloud girl?'\n\nYou'll spot Beckett (a shrivelled Daniel Weyman): he doesn't like saying more than a few words at a time. And there's no difficulty in realising that Romola Garai's Lucia is in need of help. In an arresting rather than illuminating performance she behaves like Alice in Wonderland trapped in the shrinking room: stooped, gangling, clumsy, with fixed eyes, widespread arms and nervous plucking of her garments. This is madness by numbers: the only mystery is that she's allowed to roll around the floor saying 'piss' for so long.\n\nSo far, so clear. But not necessarily true. A meticulous book about Lucia Joyce by Carol Loeb Shloss gives a similar account of the combustible Joyce household but shows a different Lucia: a talented modern dancer, glittering in mermaid scales, and posing in substantial knickers as a figure on a Greek vase. One psychiatric report speculated that it was turning from dance that drove her mad. Hastings barely touches on her gifts: in one bleak episode he shows Lucia dancing for her daddy and falling over. By stripping her of talent he diminishes his play's expressiveness (what would Calico have been like had it had dance as well as incessant verbiage?), and pushes Lucia towards victimhood, someone defined by her thwarted relationships and her (there's a tiny hint of incest here) dependence on her parents.\n\nEdward Hall's production is overwhelmed by the effort of keeping together the tumult of scenes. Only Imelda Staunton as Nora Barnacle - striding, frowning and eventually crumpling - gives any sense of interior life. Calico has piggybacked its way into the West End on its characters' famous names; it should hike out of there quickly.\n\nThere have been few more revealing dramatisations of Dickens than Neil Bartlett's hallucinogenic, realistic adaptation of Oliver Twist. Narrated by the Artful Dodger, freezing from time to time into tableaux, the play captures Dickens's cartoonish shapes and his violent switches of moods, his bleeding heart and his shrewdness, the glare and the gloom of his foggy London.The keynote is a self-conscious theatricality.\n\nRae Smith's design puts a stage within a stage: bright bulbs hanging above a set that seems to have been tacked together out of ancient wooden packing-cases. Paule Constable's transformative lighting flashes on figures that might have come straight from the pen of Cruikshank. The chalk-white cheeks, lantern jaws, ingrained smuts and grime, stooped shoulders, sunken chests, over-long trailing limbs - all these belong to Dickens's shadowy thief world; Mr Bumble - his waistcoat stretched to popping point over a belly that looks like a pregnancy - is the preening embodiment of a well-fed exploiter.\n\nThough the action is severely cut, the words are Dickens's own, and spoken with a relish that conjures up the writer's meaty prose. They are tellingly interwoven with Gerard McBurney's music, which draws on contemporary music hall song.\n\nJordan Metcalfe's Oliver is first a convincing, not-too-sweet waif and later a smug little prison visitor, beaming in his Sunday suit at a deranged Fagin. And Michael Feast's Fagin is magnificent: fluttering and screeching, he looks sometimes like a pirate, sometimes like the villain in a melodrama, and most often like a magician who can send his child followers to sleep with an insinuating whisper. As he gathered the little ones to him, on the day that Marc Dutroux went on trial in Belgium, the air at the Lyric froze.\n\nThornton Wilder's 1942 play The Skin of Our Teeth is propelled by one gag: that of seeing the history of the universe through the eyes of small-town America. Thus a pinny-and-slippers suburban couple turnto each other to inquire: 'Have you milked the mammoth?'\n\nThe play begins in the Ice Age, takes in the Flood, and ends with a postwar sequence in which people lament the difficulty of making a good peace. The message is that history repeats itself but people pick themselves up and go on. It was hugely popular on Broadway and in postwar Britain, and what with the climate-change and postwar prattle, it's easy enough to pick out down-homey morals for today, alongside the formal innovations: the cast are continually bursting out of character to wrangle about their lines; as the couple's pet dinosaur scuttles in to warm himself at the radiator you can see a Thurber cartoon in the offing.\n\nDavid Lan's bravura production delivers more than the play promises. The big effects - stage cracking in two, the cast disappearing into a cleft of the ocean - are staged with full-on Young Vic panache. David Troughton is an impressive pater familias - booming, bullying and vulnerable and Indira Varma is a velvet-voiced triumph as the vamp maid.",

Stay in your comfort zone, listen to your body and you'll get there.\"\n\nShe prescribed a three-pronged regimen for each participant to follow between three and five times a week that includes stretching plus cardiovascular and strength training.\n\nIessa Jenkins, 30, a single mom from the Bronx, is eager to get back into regular physical activity after surgery several years ago made exercise difficult. But she's worried about bulking up and doubts she can come up with a realistic plan without help.\n\n\"You're not going to get bulky. Women do not bulk the way men do,\" Holland said.\n\nHolland recommended starting with 3- and 5-pound dumbbells for arm exercises, 10-pound weights to strengthen Jenkins' back and 70-pound weights to work her legs.\n\n\"I didn't have the faith in myself to do it on my own,\" Jenkins said. \"The extra help really pays off.\"\n\nBarbara Henderickson, 54, is recovering from a knee injury.\n\nHolland suggested squeezing a play ball between her knees for four to six seconds at a time to strengthen her inner thighs and quads. For Henderickson, who lives in Brooklyn, Holland's online stretching and strength-building workouts are easy to follow.\n\nSusan Salinari and Michele Hoey, 30-something friends who work together at a Staten Island luncheonette, are trying to lose weight together. Holland suggests they exercise as a pair at least twice a week.\n\nEarly in their session, Salinari pointed at a copy of one of Holland's at-home exercise videos that shows the instructor with her arm around a skeleton.\n\n\"That's what we're going to look like at the end of this, Michele!\" Salinari said.",

    "text": "Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times\n\nA rescued dog at Kennedy Airport this month. More Photos \u00bb\n\nON a Sunday morning in March, the cavernous arrival hall at Terminal 8 at Kennedy International Airport was virtually deserted save for a cluster of people wearing white T-shirts with black \u201cSato Project\u201d logos huddled near the cargo entrance. But when American Airlines Flight 648 from San Juan, P.R., touched down and a small, tanned woman wearing a white fedora and blue sweat pants emerged from customs, the group snapped to attention. Christina Beckles, 39, a former Golden Gloves boxing champion and the founder of the Sato Project, a rescue organization that brings abandoned and abused dogs to the continental United States from Puerto Rico, had just landed with 17 animals in tow.\n\nMs. Beckles had spent the previous four days in Puerto Rico, and it had been an emotional trip: On Day 3 she had seen a puppy hit and killed by a sport utility vehicle that sped away. Now, she stopped to hug her husband, Bobby Beckles, 44, a professional stuntman, and dissolved into tears in his arms.\n\nThen she wiped her eyes, thanked her white-shirted entourage and got down to business: keeping tabs on the procession of crates streaming into the arrival hall. Inside were 17 satos \u2014 Puerto Rican slang for mongrels \u2014 16 of which Ms. Beckles had rescued from Dead Dog Beach, the notorious and remote spot on the island\u2019s southeastern shore, where for decades owners have routinely dumped unwanted animals.\n\nAs the containers piled up, the Beckleses methodically unlocked them, and out spilled the dogs: among them six fuzzy puppies whose mother had died while giving birth; two other puppy siblings found in a sealed cardboard box in the beach\u2019s parking lot; Shiner, a personable terrier Ms. Beckles had plucked impromptu from the local Humane Society; and Murphy, a brindled boxer mix who had turned up, wet and hungry, on the beach one morning. Upon release, the dogs cavorted as if on a play date; the smallest puppies were cuddled in volunteers\u2019 arms.\n\nOther people have wrestled with the sato problem before. A 2007 episode in Barceloneta village, where hired \u201cexterminators\u201d rounded up dozens of dogs and threw them off a bridge, focused attention on Puerto Rico\u2019s treatment of animals and led to a proposed tourist boycott of the island.\n\nThe issue was brought to light again by a People magazine article in 2008 about the frustrations of rescuers working at Dead Dog Beach. That same year, Public Law 154, which made animal abuse and abandonment illegal, became official, though advocates say that it is rarely, if ever, enforced.\n\nMaritza Rodr\u00edguez, the executive director of the Humane Society of Puerto Rico, said her shelter took in 100 unwanted dogs daily. \u201cEuthanasia in Puerto Rico is around 97 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cAdoptable animals are dying and suffering on our streets and beaches.\u201d Taking animals off the island \u201cis not the solution,\u201d Ms. Rodr\u00edguez added, \u201cbut it is one more chance to save lives.\u201d\n\nSince November, when the British-born Ms. Beckles struck out on her own after several years of volunteering for other organizations but feeling dissatisfied by the results they achieved, she has become the unlikely but unrelenting savior of Dead Dog Beach. Operating out of her apartment in Brooklyn, and with minimal financial support, she has taken 81 dogs from the beach, paid for their medical care and placed 60 of the dogs healthy enough to make the trip to the United States in adoptive homes.\n\nWithout Ms. Beckles\u2019s intervention, all of the dogs would likely be dead from starvation, sickness or worse.\n\nBy necessity, she has cultivated a network of volunteers on the island and stateside who share her passion. Two of the tiniest arrivals on Sunday were taken to their adopter in Boston by Lillian Penney of Center Moriches, N.Y., whose first encounter with the Sato Project came in February. While in Puerto Rico on a family vacation, Ms. Penney found a starving, pregnant dog in a restaurant parking lot. \u201cNobody wanted to help,\u201d she said. \u201cIt broke my heart.\u201d\n\nAfter connecting with Ms. Beckles online, Ms. Penney was quickly enlisted as an escort for three puppies aboard the flight to Kennedy Airport from San Juan \u2014 and she ended up adopting one of them. \u201cWhen you see the compassion she has, you feel like you just have to help,\u201d she said of Ms. Beckles. \u201cYou look in the eyes of these dogs and actually see the difference you\u2019re making.\u201d\n\nDEAD DOG BEACH, officially known as Playa Lucia, is nondescript in most ways, but notorious for the vagrant animals dumped there and left to fend for themselves or die. Sometimes the dogs arrive in cardboard boxes, nine terrified puppies crammed in. Sometimes they are booted out of vehicles. Many have wounds from abuse. Ms. Beckles and her surrogates do their work by daylight; after dark, the beach is safe neither for them nor the dogs because of youths who gather there to party and to use the dogs for target practice, local rescuers say.\n\n\u201cMy goal is for it to be called by its real name, Playa Lucia, again someday,\u201d she said.",

    "text": "A UK court vindicated Edward Snowden\u2019s whistleblowing on Friday by ruling that the secrecy surrounding one of the programs he exposed was, in fact, illegal. The decision is more evidence that not only were the Snowden revelations necessary and justified, but are also slowly forcing changes in both US and UK, even as both governments fiercely resist.\n\nIn a stunning ruling, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) \u2013 which oversees (and usually rubber stamps) Britain\u2019s spy agencies \u2013 declared that the intelligence-sharing rules between the NSA and GCHQ (Britain\u2019s NSA equivalent and partner-in-crime) governing their mass surveillance program violated UK human rights laws because they were kept secret for so long.\n\nThe IPT is one of Britain\u2019s most secretive and deferential courts, which makes this ruling so particularly stinging. And the only reason the surveillance program is currently lawful is because the plaintiffs \u2013 Privacy International and a coalition of other groups \u2013 forced GCHQ to reveal more of their alleged rules to the public in the course of the case, which itself all stems from the reporting on the Snowden documents.\n\nNow that the some of the secrecy surrounding the spying program has finally been declared illegal, this should have huge implications for both the British government and many members of the British media, who purposefully ignored the clearly illegal GCHQ mass surveillance program for so long (though the chances of either admitting they were wrong even in the face of this ruling is slim).\n\nThe complicit British media (with only a few exceptions) refused to cover the GCHQ story at all unless they were called in to act as public relations agencies for the government by printing fear-mongering stories claiming that anyone reporting on the issue of privacy was just helping terrorists and pedophiles.\n\nSnowden once rightly called the UK media\u2019s coverage of the GCHQ story \u201ca disservice to the public.\u201d Those papers that failed to cover their own government\u2019s illegal surveillance program should be particularly embarrassed today, given that they were not only complicit in keeping much of GCHQ\u2019s activities secret, but also assisted GCHQ in maintaining its illegality.\n\nThe UK government\u2019s own staggering chutzpah was on full display in Downing Street\u2019s bizarrely positive reaction to the ruling: in one breath, they claimed GCHQ doesn\u2019t engage in \u201cmass surveillance\u201d; in another, they bragged about how their \u201cbulk interception\u201d program is perfectly lawful now that their previously secret rules are public. (Good luck sorting out the difference.)\n\nBut Cara Nyst of Privacy International explained why this is a landmark ruling:\n\nNot once have the spooks been taken to task for overstepping the lawful boundaries of their conduct. Not a single British spy has been held accountable for mass surveillance, unlawful spying or snooping on private emails and phone calls.\n\nWhile much of the outcry over the Snowden stories around the world has focused on the NSA, GCHQ has often been much more flagrant in its violations of privacy rights of the world\u2019s citizens. Indeed, Snowden has repeatedly mentioned \u2013 including the first time he met with journalists in Hong Kong \u2013 that GCHQ\u2019s activities are much worse than the NSA. Reporting since that meeting has revealed GCHQ\u2019s \u201cfull intake\u201d tapping of Internet cables, its mass interception of journalists\u2019 emails, its aggressive hacking of non-terrorist groups that are not a threat to the government, and many other disturbind revelations.\n\nSay what you want about the NSA\u2019s misleading statements and obfuscation with the American press (and there\u2019s a lot to say), but the American spy agency has been forced to repeatedly and publicly respond to allegations about its conduct both in Congress and to the press.\n\nGCHQ, in contrast, has arrogantly refused to even address the most outrageous allegations, sticking to the exact same script every single story: \u201cAll of GCHQ\u2019s work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate ...\u201d\n\nWell, turns out their framework wasn\u2019t legal \u2013 or, at least, it wasn\u2019t until the Snowden documents forced GCHQ to release more information after being dragged into court, thereby creating one. The decision Friday was just the first of potentially dozens of cases that will come before the court, all of which were brought by privacy interest groups, and many of which will hopefully force the court to address the illegality of the actual mass spying conducted by GCHQ on a regular basis.\n\nThis case also calls for a re-examination of the British government\u2019s deplorable actions against those who have merely reported on the Snowden stories. They\u2019ve forced the Guardian to destroy a hard drive full of Snowden documents, outrageously detained Glenn Greenwald\u2019s partner David Miranda under the Terrorism Act and threatened Guardian reporters with prosecution for doing their jobs. Until now, the UK government has used vague excuses related to \u201cterrorism\u201d for their authoritarian actions \u2013 but now their motives should now be clear to all: they were trying to cover up an illegal program.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the court will react, if at all, to future cases. But this should be a warning for both the UK government and the media: the law and even the most obsequious of courts are not on your side. Your citizens aren\u2019t either.",

They dub this ethos the \u201cshorts revolution.\u201d And this particular revolution will not be televised, but it will be Facebooked, Tweeted, and Instagrammed.\n\nSince Chubbies launched in late 2011, it has only marketed itself via social media. Yet these bright, retro shorts now ship all over the U.S. and over 40 other countries. \u201cWe haven\u2019t spent much, but the growth has been awesome,\u201d says Tom Montgomery, one of Chubbies\u2019 four founders.\n\nSo what\u2019s the secret to successful word-of-mouth marketing?\n\nMORE: The Microsoft CEO candidate no one is discussing: Sam Palmisano\n\n\u201cPeople you know and respect online are the most important sources of discovery when you\u2019re looking for new things to buy,\u201d says Forrester Analyst, Zachary Reiss-Davis.\n\nBut word-of-mouth marketing isn\u2019t new. During World War II, there was a drive in the U.S. to encourage more people to eat animal organs, saving the best cuts for the military. Psychologist Kurt Lewin discovered that women \u2014 the gatekeepers of the family diet \u2014 began to reconsider their opinion of sweetmeat through conversations they had with each other.\n\nThen there are other classic cases like Tupperware, which shunned formal ads for word-of-mouth campaigns in the form of Tupperware parties. By gathering friends, family, and colleagues to advocate for their goods at informal home events, Tupperware grew into a household name.\n\nWhat is new, according to Reiss-Davis, is that companies are building structured word-of-mouth campaigns that make it easy for people to recommend and discuss products with people they know both offline and via the social web.\n\nTake Chubbies: Its customers frequently share photos and comment on each other\u2019s short-wearing escapades, turning customers into highly effective billboards. \u201cBeing able to scale in such a short time would have most likely been impossible, or very different, without Facebook,\u201d says Montgomery, adding that the opportunity for a clothing company to reach people in a visual way, is one of social media\u2019s key strengths.\n\nTo build a community of advocates, you have to be able to talk to them. When four Wharton MBA graduates started eyeglass e-commerce operation Warby Parker in 2010, they wanted to sell their eyewear directly to customers. So it made sense to market to them directly too. \u201cWe don\u2019t view social as advertising, but as a way of engaging with customers,\u201d says co-founder and joint CEO Neil Blumenthal. And they mean it. Like Chubbies, Warby Parker customers post photos of themselves wearing their shades and specs en masse. Everything from the company\u2019s \u201cClass Trip\u201d \u2014 a whimsical voyage delivering glasses across the U.S. \u2014 to their campaign to give half a million pairs of eyeglasses to people in the developing world, gives people something to talk about.\n\nTo be sure, building a social web community is a process. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t build overnight,\u201d says David Fudge, head of social media at men\u2019s clothing retailer Bonobos, who warns companies not to abandon their strategy when they don\u2019t see an immediate uptick. When it launched in 2007, its clothes were only available online, and it claims to be one of the first companies to advertise on Facebook FB .\n\nReiss-Davis argues that the most successful word-of-mouth initiatives treat customers as ambassadors and give them either special access to products or connections to executives and interesting people at the company. This level of access sounds like hard work, but it pays off. \u201cIt may take you more labor to set up a successful word-of-mouth campaign,\u201d says Reiss-Davis, \u201cbut you\u2019re not spending those advertising dollars, which tends to make up for it.\u201d\n\nMORE: America\u2019s most hated device: The cable box\n\nBonobos has an in-house team manning social media feeds. Their job is to be as active and consistent on Facebook as possible, which means responding to the majority of Facebook messages and liking Bonobos-related posts. But beyond pure manpower, what kind of content do people want to share?\n\nBonobos\u2019 Fudge focuses on visual, witty content that expresses a unique point of view. Take the company\u2019s 2013 April Fools\u2019 Day prank about a fake product called the \u201cGirlfriend Jean.\u201d The video garnered over 66,000 views on YouTube and sent record traffic to Bonobos\u2019 website. It wasn\u2019t a billboard in Times Square or a commercial during the Super Bowl, but it certainly got a message across to customers.",

    "text": "McDonald\u2019s said on Wednesday that it would begin using chickens that are not raised with antibiotics used to treat humans, a move likely to put pressure on competitors of the fast-food chain, which now sells more chicken than beef.\n\nThe decision by McDonald\u2019s, which is also one of the largest buyers of chicken in the United States, is likely to have a major impact on how poultry is raised and on the kinds of chicken restaurants serve.\n\nThe shift toward offering chicken that is largely antibiotic-free is to occur over two years, the company said. McDonald\u2019s also announced that this year it would give customers the choice of low-fat and chocolate milk from cows not treated with the artificial growth hormone rBST.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s announcement coincided with Steve Easterbrook\u2019s first week as its chief executive. But the struggling company declined to provide access to Mr. Easterbrook, who succeeded Don Thompson as chief, or to other executives to speak about the new policy, citing the \u201cquiet period\u201d required by federal regulation before the release of its financial performance report next week.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been increasingly vocal about its concerns about the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry as more bacteria and pathogens have shown resistance to such drugs. It estimated in 2013 that at least two million Americans fall sick each year because of antibiotic-resistant infections and at least 23,000 die from them.\n\nThe use of a class of antibiotics important in human medicine by farmers raising animals for food increased 16 percent from 2009 to 2012, according to a report by the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 although the agency found that sales of the drugs for that purpose had declined somewhat during that period. The government\u2019s concern has caught the attention of consumers, and food companies and restaurants are increasingly using \u201cantibiotic-free\u201d labels as a marketing tool that sometimes allows them to command a higher price.\n\nAntibiotic use policies of major chicken companies\n\nUse of human class antibiotics\n\nUse of human class antibiotics\n\n\u201cThe last time McDonald\u2019s did something like this, five other fast-food companies made similar announcements within six months,\u201d said Steven Roach, food safety program director for Food Animal Concerns Trust, one of the advocacy groups involved in the coalition Keep Antibiotics Working. \u201cI would expect we\u2019re going to see a similar pattern this time around.\u201d\n\nWendy\u2019s and Burger King said their policies prohibited the use of antibiotics to promote growth. McDonald\u2019s said its suppliers could still use ionophores, additives used to increase feed efficiency and body weight gain in animals, which are less controversial.\n\nThe National Chicken Council said in a statement that a \u201cvast majority\u201d of antibiotics used for disease prevention in the industry were never given to humans. \u201cChicken producers have a vested interest in protecting the effectiveness of antibiotics for the welfare of their animals,\u201d the council, a trade group, said. \u201cAs such, we\u2019ve proactively and voluntarily taken steps toward finding alternative ways to control disease while reducing antibiotic use.\u201d\n\nAriane Daguin, the founder and chief executive of D\u2019Artagnan, which sells high-end meat, poultry, game and truffles, said that the move by McDonald\u2019s was significant but that \u201cthe devil is in the details.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo stop using only those antibiotics that \u2018are important to human medicine\u2019 does not mean much,\u201d Ms. Daguin said. \u201cIt is important to understand what antibiotic-free really means and the need to eliminate all antibiotics to prevent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\u201d\n\nIn January, the International Production & Processing Expo, billed as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest annual poultry, feed and meat technology exposition,\u201d devoted a panel to antibiotic-free poultry production. An industry consultant who participated said that antibiotic-free chicken was no longer a niche business.\n\n\u201cI think in a few years, one-third of chicken and turkey will be antibiotic-free,\u201d the consultant, Richard Kottmeyer, managing director of Strategic, an agricultural consulting firm, said, according to a report on WATTAgNet.com. \u201cThe problem then is the other 66 percent of consumers will be resenting the fact that their chicken isn\u2019t antibiotic-free.\u201d\n\nLast September, Perdue became the first major United States poultry company to say it was no longer using antibiotics in its hatcheries, one of the last parts of its production process where the drugs were still in use. A month later, Tyson Foods made a similar announcement, although unlike Perdue, Tyson still uses antibiotics for disease prevention.\n\nAnd a year ago, Chick-fil-A, the fast-growing fast-food chicken business, said it was no longer using chicken treated with antibiotics. Panera has used meat raised without antibiotics for more than a decade.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is somewhat late to the game, in part because its size makes it difficult to establish supply chains that can fulfill the demand in its 14,000 United States restaurants. It took the company two years, for example, to establish enough contracts to supply it with cucumbers when it added them to its menu several years ago. The company first announced a policy limiting its chicken suppliers\u2019 use of antibiotics in 2003, but it had done little to update it over the years, Mr. Roach said.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s latest move coincides with its \u201cYour Questions, Our Food\u201d marketing campaign, in which it answers questions such as whether the eggs it uses are freshly cracked and how it cooks its beef patties. Mr. Easterbrook, the new chief, used a similar program to help turn around the McDonald\u2019s business in Britain.\n\nHe is meeting this week with McDonald\u2019s franchisees and suppliers to present what he has called the Turnaround Agenda. One of the seven \u201cBig Actions\u201d he plans is to \u201cwin\u201d with the company\u2019s food by, among other things, improving taste and giving consumers food they can \u201cfeel good about\u201d eating, like chicken raised without antibiotics.\n\nWhile scores of advocates applauded Wednesday\u2019s announcement, they were already preparing for another battle with the company over the use of antibiotics in beef production. Last year, McDonald\u2019s pledged to begin buying \u201cverified sustainable\u201d beef by 2016, but Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a Democrat from upstate New York who has long taken an interest in food and agricultural issues, sent the company a letter in January, saying she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the criteria for determining what beef would qualify.\n\nThose standards were developed by the Global Roundtable on Sustainable Beef, a business group of which McDonald\u2019s is a member, and were condemned as \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d and \u201ctoothless\u201d by advocacy groups in favor of eliminating antibiotic use in beef. \u201cThe failure to include meaningful restrictions on antibiotic use in the agreed-upon standards calls into question McDonald\u2019s commitment to ending the misuse of antibiotics and could contradict its own policy,\u201d Ms. Slaughter wrote.",

That puts his removal, which would have a vote in late spring or early summer, within the realm of possibility.\n\nPoliticians and political operatives far beyond Wisconsin will be watching closely, not just for what the recall effort may imply for other states\u2019 leaders who are considering cuts to workers\u2019 benefits and union powers as a way to solve budget problems, but also as a sign for the presidential race. Wisconsin was one of several pivotal Midwestern states that gave Barack Obama solid victories in 2008 but then elected Republicans, including Mr. Walker, in significant numbers in 2010. Money from outside the state is certain to pour in from both sides for the recall vote.\n\nIn an interview in which Mr. Walker reflected on what he described as his \u201cvery surreal\u201d first year in office, he spoke of the outside forces. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real sense that the government unions don\u2019t want anybody \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 doing this,\u201d Mr. Walker said of his moves to limit benefits and bargaining rights for public workers. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to try to make an example of me.\u201d\n\nAlthough recall organizers, calling themselves United Wisconsin, say they expect to submit thousands more signatures than the 540,208 required for a new election (or one-quarter of the voters for governor in 2010), Mr. Walker said he believed he could ultimately hold onto his job. \u201cI look at it optimistically and say that means there\u2019s still a majority of voters in the state who opted not to sign a recall petition and hopefully a majority of whom want us to still keep moving the state forward.\u201d\n\nAround Wisconsin, where control of the governor\u2019s office and both chambers of the Legislature flipped to Republican from Democratic a year ago, people complain that the tone of political discourse has turned uncharacteristically feverish, polarized and ugly \u2014 with the recall effort, which formally began in November, as only the latest evidence.\n\nScores of problems have been claimed: intentionally scribbled-on petitions, physical altercations about petitions, fake names on petitions, and a slew of screamed bad words (not to mention at least one egg) exchanged over petitions. Some Democrats say they began carrying cameras in case they needed to document untoward acts. And Republicans launched a \u201cRecall Integrity Center\u201d Web site where people could report \u201cshady tactics\u201d from the other side.\n\n\u201cOne of the worst things that\u2019s happened in this state is how divided it\u2019s become over this, even inside some families,\u201d said Marlene Ott, who was gathering recall signatures last week inside the airport. Several people holding boarding passes spotted her portable stand and stopped to sign. But another passer-by, clutching the hands of two young girls, called out angrily, \u201cThis is disgraceful, absolutely disgraceful!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d the man, Henri Kinson of Whitewater, asked afterward, \u201cshould my granddaughters pay for these entitlements they\u2019re calling rights?\u201d\n\nThe move against the governor is only part of the turmoil here. Separate recall drives are under way against the Republican lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch, and four Republican state senators, including Scott Fitzgerald, the majority leader, who helped pass Mr. Walker\u2019s collective bargaining plan after Senate Democrats left Wisconsin to prevent a vote. Last summer, the same issue led to nine recall elections, which resulted in two Senate seats changing hands and a narrower Republican majority of 17 to 16.\n\nCarol Carlin, a retired teacher whose signs beckoned people to park in the driveway of her Milwaukee County house and add their names to recall petitions, said the psyches of public workers had been devastated by Mr. Walker\u2019s cuts. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to become teachers when you are absolutely treated as the leeches on the system,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Walker has said his cuts to collective bargaining were needed to solve a $3.6 billion state budget deficit and defends the move as one element of a plan to turn the state\u2019s economic climate around. But his critics\u2019 complaints now reach beyond the union issue, to questions about his handling of the environment, about a criminal investigation focused on people who worked for Milwaukee County during his tenure as county executive, and about his promises of 250,000 new jobs in the state during his four-year term.\n\nIn recent consecutive months, the state has been losing jobs, government estimates show, and since Mr. Walker took office, fewer than 20,000 new private sector jobs have been reported.",

    "text": "GREER, Ariz. \u2013 A 225-square-mile blaze that has grown into the third-largest fire in Arizona's history covered a mountain vacation town in a smoky fog Sunday, as wind blew smoke from the burning pine forest well into nearby New Mexico and Colorado.\n\nCrews have not contained the fire near the New Mexico-Arizona state line, which has forced residents to evacuate from several mountain towns.\n\nIn the vacation town of Greer, which has fewer than 200 year-round residents, many voluntarily left on Saturday. Those who remained, mostly business owners, dealt with haze heavily tinged with smoke on Sunday. Among them was the owner of the 101-year-old Molly Butler Lodge, who was hauling out his most valuable items.\n\nAllan Johnson spent the morning getting antiques, including an 1886 table brought by covered wagon from Utah and a 1928 Oldsmobile the lodge uses for weddings, out of the fire's path. He said he was not taking reservations but was keeping open the restaurant, mainly as a meeting place.\n\nGreer is within miles of the fire, which officials expect will grow given a windy forecast and expected dry lightning Sunday and Monday. If the blaze comes within two miles of a containment line nearby, the town will be evacuated.\n\n\"We're all waiting for the word,\" Johnson said. \"It could be 24 hours, could be eight hours. It might not happen at all -- that's what we're all rooting and praying for.\"\n\nWinds died down overnight, allowing crews to burn 30 miles of containment lines between active and unburned areas that create a buffer from the most violent wind-driven runs.\n\n\"It gives a much greater chance of it having diminished fire behavior as it approaches the lines,\" fire information officer Peter Frenzen told The Associated Press. \"And that's the concern, that you might get intense fire activity that might throw embers over the line and spot beyond our control lines.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Gov. Jan Brewer called the blaze \"horrific\" following an aerial tour and said it was \"the likes of a fire of which I have never experienced from the air.\"\n\nIn Nutrioso, the blaze came within two miles of homes, and heavy yellowish smoke in Alpine reduced visibility to about a quarter mile. Smoke drifted into northwestern New Mexico towns such as Fence Lake and Zuni Pueblo, said National Weather Service meteorologist Mark Fetting, and was expected as far north as Gallup. The haze also could reach as far as Albuquerque by Monday.\n\nSpokesman Brad Pitassi said 1,300 firefighters were at the blaze, including some \"from Oregon all the way to New York.\"\n\nSince the blaze started May 29, four summer rental cabins have been destroyed, the U.S. Forest Service said. No serious injuries have been reported.\n\nThe fire is the state's third-largest, behind a 2002 blaze that blackened more than 732 square miles and one in 2005 that burned about 387 square miles in the Phoenix suburb of Cave Creek.\n\nThe state also was contending with another major wildfire, its fifth-largest, in far southeastern Arizona that threatened a church camp and two communities. Air crews dumped water and retardant near the Methodist church camp Saturday as the 156-square-mile blaze burned around the evacuated camp in the steep Pine Canyon near the community of Paradise.\n\nParadise, as well as East Whitetail Canyon, was evacuated in advance and the nearby Chiricahua National Monument was closed as a precaution. Crews set backfires and kept the blaze from about a dozen occupied homes and other vacation residences Saturday.\n\n\"Paradise, even though they did protect it from the initial fire that passed by the day before yesterday, it's still not totally out of the woods,\" said Dave Killebrew, an information officer for the team battling the blaze.",

Kaiser dies for his trouble, and that fact fuels Goffard's narrative, which our reviewer, Richard Rayner, calls \u201ca moving and powerful\u201d story.

    "text": "The Yankees open their season Tuesday in the same place they ended their last one: Minute Maid Park, the home of the Houston Astros. They bring along $470 million in new players and expectations of a pinstriped parade this fall.\n\nThe Astros, to be polite, are at a different stage.\n\n\u201cWhen we face the New York Yankees in our opening series, our expectation \u2014 every man in that clubhouse and every person in our front office \u2014 is we\u2019re going to win those games,\u201d Jeff Luhnow, Houston\u2019s general manager, said near the end of spring training. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of talent on the field. It\u2019s young, it\u2019s unproven, it\u2019s untested, and there\u2019s a lot of variability that occurs with young players. But part of that variability is on the upside. We\u2019ve got a chance to win every night.\u201d\n\nOf course they do; it is baseball, after all. Even while losing 111 games last season, the Astros still won 51.\n\nManager Bo Porter said that over the winter, he made good on his late-season vow to rewatch the entire season.\n\n\u201cPainfully, I did,\u201d Porter said. \u201cPainfully. Don\u2019t be without the painfully.\u201d\n\nPorter encourages self-examination. At his direction, every locker stall has a small mirror so players can take one last look before heading to the field and ask themselves, Who are you going to be today?\n\nSo just who are the Astros? They are the new home base for the Ryan family, as Nolan is the executive adviser and his son Reid is the president for business operations. The Astros may have more alumni of the analytics website Baseball Prospectus in their front-office than any other team in the league. And after signing starter Scott Feldman, trading for center fielder Dexter Fowler and signing some veteran relievers, they expect to be better.\n\nBut the Astros foretold the story of their season March 20, when they assigned six top prospects to the minors: shortstop Carlos Correa, first baseman Jon Singleton, starters Mark Appel and Mike Foltynewicz, and outfielders Delino DeShields Jr. and George Springer. Packed away were the jewels of a farm system ranked in January as baseball\u2019s best by ESPN\u2019s Keith Law. The focus remains on development.\n\n\u201cOur whole next generation of superstars could be in that group,\u201d Luhnow said, adding that he understood fans were eager to see those players now. \u201cFans get excited, and that\u2019s great. But our decision is different than the fans\u2019 desire. We need to take this entire pipeline and bring it up in a way that allows us to win championships, and that means we don\u2019t want everybody coming up together.\u201d\n\nThe shortstop for the moment is Jonathan Villar, 22, who hit .243 with 18 steals in 58 major league games last season. But Correa, 19, is considered a cornerstone. Correa, who said he grew up idolizing Derek Jeter, will start the season in high Class A, and the team plans to promote him to Class AA after a month or so.\n\n\u201cTo see all that talent playing in Houston, it will be something great,\u201d Correa, the top pick in the 2012 draft, said. \u201cIt will be something special.\u201d\n\nThe Astros reached the playoffs six times from 1997 to 2005, but a thin farm system and a series of trades doomed them to 106 losses in 2011. Jim Crane bought the team that November and has taken a patient approach. Part of the Astros\u2019 appeal, he said in 2012, was a cable network the team was creating with the N.B.A.\u2019s Rockets.\n\n\u201cI think over a long period of time, that\u2019ll be a better deal than Dallas\u2019s deal,\u201d Crane said then, referring to the Texas Rangers\u2019 lucrative television contract. \u201cSo we get the team turned around, put the ingredients in place, we should be one of the top three, four, five revenue teams in baseball when those things come together \u2014 and they will come together.\u201d\n\nYet only about 40 percent of the Houston market has access to the network. In November, Crane\u2019s ownership group filed a lawsuit against Comcast, NBCUniversal and the former Astros owner Drayton McLane, claiming fraud and civil conspiracy and tens of millions of dollars in losses.\n\nThe Astros have the lowest payroll in the majors, at $45 million (up from $26 million in 2013), but Luhnow said the TV struggle had not affected that figure or the team\u2019s budget for amateur talent. Baseball\u2019s collective bargaining agreement \u2014 ratified just as Crane was taking over \u2014 allows the team with the worst record to spend more to sign amateurs, without penalties, than any other team. The Astros believe they are using the system to their advantage, with hopes of a payoff later.\n\n\u201cAny good company or good executive will maximize the regulatory environment,\u201d Luhnow said. \u201cEssentially, that\u2019s what happened. Our regulatory environment changed two years ago. Competitive balance is always something the commissioner\u2019s talked about, and we\u2019ve always, as an industry, attempted to achieve that using different tools. The vehicles were changed in the last C.B.A.\u201d\n\nWith their three-year, $30 million contract for Feldman, the Astros at least have a tangible example of an investment in the present. Feldman started on opening day for the Texas Rangers in 2010, and although his statistics have been ordinary since then (27-35 with a 4.57 earned run average), he expects to be part of a revival.\n\n\u201cNobody knows when this team\u2019s going to turn the page and start winning a lot of ballgames, but everything is headed in that direction right now,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the No. 1-rated farm system. You know when that wave of talent reaches this level, they\u2019re going to be here for a while.\u201d",

Also, female candidates were not allowed to directly address male voters, having to either make presentations from behind partitions, relying on projectors and microphones, or via male supporters and relatives.\n\nThe candidates are vying for about 2,100 council seats with an additional 1,050 seats appointed with approval from the king.

    "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 A GENERATION ago, this West Coast metropolis became a \u201cthird world city.\u201d At least in the rhetoric of certain East Coast thinkers.\n\nA 1991 book by David Rieff cited visitors who were stunned by \u201cseeing nothing but brown faces, hearing nothing but Spanish on the streets.\u201d The arrival of coffee-colored Latino masses (like me and my Guatemalan-American family), together with the spread of Mandarin and Korean logograms on street signs, led Mr. Rieff to call this the \u201ccapital of the third world.\u201d\n\nAs a native of the city, I was offended to hear it tagged with such a denigrating label. But in recent years, and for different reasons, I\u2019ve come to believe that a metropolis of the \u201cdeveloping world,\u201d to use a more polite expression, is being born here.\n\nIts center is not in East Los Angeles, or any other Latino neighborhood; nor in our recently christened \u201cLittle Bangladesh.\u201d The third world exists everywhere here \u2014 in the spread of inequality.\n\nThe deepening gap between rich and poor is both a sociological fact and a state of mind. The cost of housing is up dramatically, and so is homelessness.\n\n\u201cIf it feels like there are people living on the streets and under bridges everywhere you look, it\u2019s because there are,\u201d Bianca Barragan wrote for the website L.A. Curbed last month, after a survey by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority found an 85 percent increase in the number of people living in tents and cars over the past two years. In all, the census counted more than 25,000 homeless people in the city, up 12 percent over the same period.\n\nIn my hillside neighborhood in northeast Los Angeles, the value of a two-bedroom home has climbed to $750,000 or more. Buy in, and you could get a nice view of a valley with sycamore trees and a homeless camp. On social media, I hear my neighbors demanding that city officials intensify indigent-removal efforts.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not gone,\u201d wrote a resident on a neighborhood website in May, after city officials cleared out scores of homeless people. \u201cSaw 6 people or more on the hillside. Tents and cooking! Looks like more work needs to be done.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has both the most \u201cultrarich\u201d (people worth more than $30 million) and the worst poverty rate in America. Even though San Francisco recently overtook Los Angeles in ultrarich residents, ostentatious affluence and permanent poverty live side by side here.\n\n\u201cLook, Pap\u00e1,\u201d my 10-year-old daughter said as our old Subaru puttered past a local intersection that\u2019s been occupied for ages by homeless veterans. \u201cA Maserati!\u201d\n\nSilver, sleek, an apparition from the French Riviera, it glided past a lumbering city bus. A few days later, we saw a Tesla \u2014 the new status symbol of our eco-glitterati \u2014 driving along the Arroyo Seco Parkway, past the huts of wood, wire and blue tarpaulin that lined the roadway.\n\nThe paradox of increasing homelessness and rising prosperity has finally got Los Angeles talking about inequality. But the gap between rich and poor has been building here for 40 years. Every boom and bust simply accentuates the trend.\n\nBill Boyarsky, a retired city editor at The Los Angeles Times, dates the beginning to the decline of industrial Los Angeles in the 1970s: \u201cWe lost a huge number of middle-class jobs.\u201d At the same time, the tax revolt led by the businessman and politician Howard Jarvis cut funding for public education. \u201cWe ended up limiting the ability of kids to move ahead of their parents,\u201d said Mr. Boyarsky.\n\nLos Angeles still has a much larger middle class than your average developing-world city. But privilege and inequality are spreading in all sorts of public places.\n\nRich and poor have long suffered on the freeway together: Porsches and pickups alike, gridlocked. Now we have new toll roads; on some freeways, you can literally buy your way into the fast lane.\n\nDodger Stadium used to be one of the city\u2019s most democratic entertainment venues. In 1962, the most expensive seat was $5.50, about four times the price of a bleacher (or pavilion) seat. These days, field-level seats can cost up to $1,000, more than 30 times the price of a bleacher seat.\n\nThirty years ago, a family of four at poverty level lived on about $10,650 \u2014 about double the annual tuition at the city\u2019s top prep schools. The equivalent federal poverty line today, $24,250, would barely cover two-thirds of this year\u2019s tuition at schools like Harvard-Westlake or Polytechnic in Pasadena.\n\nIn the cities of the developing world, class differences this wide are fixed. Homelessness is a kind of caste, and the poorest city dwellers live in permanent squatter communities. In Buenos Aires, where I once lived, their homes are often built with discarded bricks and tiles.\n\nLos Angeles doesn\u2019t have neighborhoods like that yet, but homelessness has become semi-permanent in many places.\n\nA decade ago, a man created a shelter under a bridge across the street from my in-laws in South Pasadena; a series of homeless people has occupied it ever since \u2014 most recently, a white man of about 65 nicknamed the Cowboy. He told me he worked in aerospace until an accident left him with a brain injury.\n\nThe Cowboy (he declined to tell his real name) is proud of his home improvements: a modest retaining wall, a wood-chip floor. He\u2019s earned the trust of his property-owning neighbors. Once, he said, they passed around a petition to keep the police from kicking him out. As long as Los Angeles holds on to such compassion, it won\u2019t be a true \u201cthird world city.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboy asked me to visit again soon. \u201cLike a bad habit,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll keep coming back into your world.\u201d",

    "text": "In a recent post about Digg, I wrote: \u201cit\u2019s obvious to see that Digg users are growing in power. And while this could be a force for good, it also means that an unsupported claim on a blog could quickly be blown out of proportion.\u201d Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened to the O\u2019Reilly contributor Steve Mallett, who was accused of stealing Digg\u2019s CSS by an anonymous blogspot blogger. This O\u2019Reilly post explains more:\n\nSteve Mallett, O\u2019Reilly Network editor and blogger, was very publicly accused, via a Digg story, of stealing Digg\u2019s CSS pages. The story was voted up rapidly and made the homepage, acquiring thousands of diggs (thumbs-up) from the Digg community along the way. There was only one problem: Steve didn\u2019t steal Digg\u2019s CSS pages.\n\nThe real story has now made its way onto the Digg frontpage, but the issue has led some bloggers to (incorrectly) criticize the \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d philosophy.\n\nGreg Linden responds by saying \u201cTake a majority vote from people who don\u2019t know the answer, and you\u2019re not going to get the right answer. Summing collective ignorance isn\u2019t going to create wisdom.\u201d Greg\u2019s conclusion may sound logical, but it\u2019s flawed. Nat from O\u2019Reilly makes the same mistake, saying: \u201cThis is a classic Web 2.0 problem: it\u2019s hard to aggregate the wisdom of the crowd without aggregating their madness as well.\u201d But the problem is not that the wisdom of crowds doesn\u2019t deliver good answers (in fact it does) - the problem is that Digg is not a true example of a wisdom of crowds system. Let me explain\u2026\n\nFor the wisdom of crowds to work, every individual must work independently. For example, if I ask 1000 people to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar and then average the results, I\u2019ll get a fairly accurate answer. However, if I allow the individuals to view the guesses of others before they vote, they may decide to give an answer which is similar to those given by other members of the group. Hence, it is more likely that the average answer will be inaccurate. The reason that Digg creates a mob mentality is that users can see how other members have acted before they vote. Seeing that a hundred users have approved a story already makes you think that there must be some validity to it. Instead of errors cancelling out, they are amplified. However, if you couldn\u2019t see those diggs, you wouldn\u2019t be so sure. Richard MacManus refers to the problem as the groupthink at Digg, which is a good way to describe it.\n\nYou could argue that del.icio.us is more true to the wisdom of crowds than digg - since most people bookmark pages independently and for their own benefit (rather than copying the bookmarks of others), groupthink is less likely. But unfortunately del.icio.us is subject to all kinds of external factors that could lead to inaccuracies.\n\nI\u2019m not a social scientist, so I expect this post has a few inaccuracies of its own. Feel free to correct them in the comments - just make sure you don\u2019t read the other comments first!\n\nPS. I should probably add that I\u2019m a fan of Digg - I\u2019m just pointing out that its problems are not a reflection on the wisdom of crowds theory.\n\n[More from Steve Mallett, Venture Chronicles and others]\n\nUPDATE: I\u2019ve added more comments on this over at Greg Linden\u2019s blog. I hope he doesn\u2019t mind if I reprint them here:\n\nThis isn\u2019t really true. In fact, ignorant people can make good collective decisions because their errors cancel out. The problem isn\u2019t that the wisdom of crowds doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s that Digg doesn\u2019t reflect the wisdom of crowds as described by James Surowiecki. More here:\n\nDigg and the So-Called Wisdom of Mobs\n\n6:43 AM Greg Linden said\u2026\n\nThanks for that link, Pete. Wisdom of the mob. Heh, heh.\n\nI\u2019m essentially trying to make the same point as you, though you may have made it more clearly than I. Majority vote may extract the wisdom of the crowd, or it may only extract the groupthink of the mob. Hiding the votes before people have voted might help a little, but I think there has to be a better, more reliable ways to extract the wisdom from the crowd.\n\nI think what you want to do is attempt to identify experts in the crowd, people with the necessary information to make the decision, and weight their opinions more heavily. Slashdot discussions, Amazon customer reviews, many sites have early attempts at this, but obviously a lot more work needs to be done.\n\n7:47 AM Pete Cashmore said\u2026\n\nYou\u2019ve missed the point. The *whole point* of the wisdom of crowds is that the collective wisdom of a group can be *as good or better* than an expert or team of experts. For instance, instead of hiring consultants (\u201dexperts\u201d by another name), companies should set up internal prediction markets so their employees can vote on issues relevant to the company. Picking out \u201cexperts\u201d is the last thing that Digg should do - this may actually lead to a less accurate/truthful result. Instead, they need to remove the groupthink from the system.\n\nOne last point: is it actually a good thing for Digg if the stories are accurate and truthful? If the community cannot see how others are voting (necessary to prevent groupthink), then the community aspect becomes weaker. So while these measures might limit groupthink, it seems to me that it\u2019s actually a shared sense of identity that holds the Digg community together. To put it another way, Digg is more likely to survive precisely because of the inherent groupthink.\n\nPete, I think we\u2019re agreeing here.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have used the word \u201cexpert\u201d. That sounds like I\u2019m referring to one person in the crowd. I meant making some effort to isolate the people in the crowd with an informed opinion.\n\nInternal prediction markets work for exactly this reason. If you go to the Iowa Electronic Market and plop down cash, you likely have a good reason to be asserting that X is true. There is a cost to making a bet, so only people with informed opinions make bets.\n\nGreat point on how groupthink might help Digg succeed. There certainly are news outlets that have benefited from creating a strong community with groupthink.\n\nUnderstood. So perhaps \u201ceditor\u201d is a better word than \u201cexpert\u201d. Better still: \u201ctrusted people\u201d. I\u2019m not opposed to subscribing to \u201ctrusted people\u201d, rather than topics. In fact, if you subscribe to a member of del.icio.us you generally get better results than subscribing to a tag - what\u2019s more, it\u2019s spam free.\n\nBut there\u2019s a tendency (risk?) that we\u2019re just trying to reintroduce the old-media hierarchies into this new \u201cdemocratic\u201d system. If there are to be editors, it needs to be the case that anyone can be an editor, and users can subscribe to whichever editor they choose (which might be what you\u2019re suggesting). If there are a limited number of editors, then you re-introduce the problems that new-media is trying to solve (ie. news is dictated from above by a select number of people). In fact, the word \u201ceditor\u201d is so strongly associated with hierarchies that I\u2019d prefer to avoid it altogether.\n\nLike I say, I\u2019m not suggesting that Digg should necessarily change - it may indeed be the ideal system if the aim is to foster a close community. But if you wanted to create a new system that was less prone to groupthink AND avoid the introduction of traditional hierarchies, you might consider some of these ideas.\n\nPS. As you probably know, monetized prediction markets are more accurate, but setting one up means tackling all kinds of legal issues - it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been considering for a while. I spoke a bit about this in my post on Smarkets.",

You go in another room and she wants to have government taking over health care,\" Romney said to laughter and applause at a town hall meeting in southwest Florida just days before the scary Halloween holiday on Wednesday. \"You go in the next room and she's weakened homeland security by voting against the authority of our government to listen in to al-Qaeda's calls.\"\n\nRomney said he would keep Clinton from reaching the White House not by acting like her \u2014 an apparent dig at rival Rudy Giuliani \u2014 but by building on the conservative foundation laid by Ronald Reagan.\n\nRomney also touted his bipartisan work with a Democratic legislature while he was governor of Massachusetts. Responding to an audience member who expressed frustration with Congress members who strictly vote along party lines, Romney pledged to work with opposition leaders.\n\n\"We had to agree to solve things together,\" Romney said, citing his state's health care reform effort and balanced budget. \"I will not make it a personal, rancorous battle.\"\n\nReached by telephone later in the day, Clinton campaign spokesman, Mo Elleithee said: \"Given Governor Romney's long history of flip floppping on issues, we're not worried.

    "text": "Food pairings: Tomatoes with extra-virgin olive oil, spice-rubbed grilled meat, mixed berries, fish and curry powder, spinach with lemon.\n\nJust as a good marriage elevates each partner, certain foods are better \u2014 for health and taste \u2014 eaten together. Scientists are beginning to uncover food combinations that work synergistically to boost nutrient absorption and antioxidant potency beyond the beneficial effects of the foods when eaten alone. Many of these pairings enhance each other flavor-wise too. Here are five nutritional power couples that are perfect for the summer season:\n\nEllie Krieger offers tips for a healthy lifestyle.\n\nEllie Krieger offers tips for a healthy lifestyle.\n\n1 Tomatoes with extra-virgin olive oil\n\nThere is nothing as divine as a ripe summer tomato made all the more luscious with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. It turns out that combination does a whole lot more than taste good. The oil helps your body absorb the tomato's potent fat-soluble antioxidants, lycopene and other carotenoids, which benefit every organ in the body, especially the skin and heart. Extra-virgin olive oil, also packed with antioxidants and full of deep fruity flavor, is the ideal choice for the job.\n\nOne of the season's culinary highlights is grilling. But when meat is cooked over high heat, some of its fat forms a compound called malondialdehyde, which has been linked to chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. It turns out, pairing meat with herbs and spices can significantly reduce these damaging compounds \u2014 the antioxidants in the spices neutralize them. A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported a 71% reduction in these compounds when burgers were cooked with an antioxidant-rich blend of oregano, rosemary, black pepper, paprika and garlic. Try rubbing lean steaks with dried herbs and spices or blending some into burgers before firing them up.\n\nA study in Biochemistry examining the antioxidant power of berries found that a mix of berries eaten together provided significantly more cardiovascular protection than when eaten separately. Each offers a unique array of antioxidants that complements and enhances that of the others. So for color, taste and health, try a bowl of juicy blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and blackberries.\n\nDark greens such as spinach and arugula are loaded with vitamins A and C, as well as minerals including iron. Serving them with a spritz of lemon not only brings out the flavor, it also changes the form of iron in the vegetable, making it more easily absorbed. For a simple summer salad, and an iron boost, whisk together the juice of half a lemon with 2 tablespoons olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and toss with baby spinach leaves.\n\n5 Fish and curry powder\n\nAccording to a study in the journal BMC Cancer, two big cancer inhibitors, DHA (the healthy fat in fish) and curcumin (an active compound in yellow curry), work much better when eaten together than separately. They also bring a lot to the table flavor-wise. Taking advantage of this dynamic duo is as simple as sprinkling some yellow curry powder on your salmon fillet before cooking.\n\nRegistered dietitian Ellie Krieger is host of Food Network's Healthy Appetite, which airs on theCooking Channel.

    "text": "Michael J. Potter is one of the last little big men left in organic food.\n\nMore than 40 years ago, Mr. Potter bought into a hippie cafe and \u201cwhole earth\u201d grocery here that has since morphed into a major organic foods producer and wholesaler, Eden Foods.\n\nBut one morning last May, he hopped on his motorcycle and took off across the Plains to challenge what organic food \u2014 or as he might have it, so-called organic food \u2014 has become since his tie-dye days in the Haight district of San Francisco.\n\nThe fact is, organic food has become a wildly lucrative business for Big Food and a premium-price-means-premium-profit section of the grocery store. The industry\u2019s image \u2014 contented cows grazing on the green hills of family-owned farms \u2014 is mostly pure fantasy. Or rather, pure marketing. Big Food, it turns out, has spawned what might be called Big Organic.\n\nBear Naked, Wholesome & Hearty, Kashi: all three and more actually belong to the cereals giant Kellogg. Naked Juice? That would be PepsiCo, of Pepsi and Fritos fame. And behind the pastoral-sounding Walnut Acres, Healthy Valley and Spectrum Organics is none other than Hain Celestial, once affiliated with Heinz, the grand old name in ketchup.\n\nOver the last decade, since federal organic standards have come to the fore, giant agri-food corporations like these and others \u2014 Coca-Cola, Cargill, ConAgra, General Mills, Kraft and M&M Mars among them \u2014 have gobbled up most of the nation\u2019s organic food industry. Pure, locally produced ingredients from small family farms? Not so much anymore.\n\nAll of which riles Mr. Potter, 62. Which is why he took off in late May from here for Albuquerque, where the cardinals of the $30-billion-a-year organic food industry were meeting to decide which ingredients that didn\u2019t exactly sound fresh from the farm should be blessed as allowed ingredients in \u201corganic\u201d products. Ingredients like carrageenan, a seaweed-derived thickener with a somewhat controversial health record. Or synthetic inositol, which is manufactured using chemical processes.\n\nMr. Potter was allowed to voice his objections to carrageenan for three minutes before the group, the National Organic Standards Board.\n\n\u201cSomeone said, \u2018Thank you,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Potter recalls.\n\nTwo days later, the board voted 10 to 5 to keep carrageenan on the growing list of nonorganic ingredients that can be used in products with the coveted \u201ccertified organic\u201d label. To organic purists like Mr. Potter, it was just another sign that Big Food has co-opted \u2014 or perhaps corrupted \u2014 the organic food business.\n\n\u201cThe board is stacked,\u201d Mr. Potter says. \u201cEither they don\u2019t have a clue, or their interest in making money is more important than their interest in maintaining the integrity of organics.\u201d\n\nHe calls the certified-organic label a fraud and refuses to put it on Eden\u2019s products.\n\nBig businesses argue that the enormous demand for organic products requires a scale that only they can provide \u2014 and that there is no difference between big and small producers. \u201cWe\u2019re all certified, and we all follow the same standards,\u201d said Carmela Beck, who manages the organic program at Driscoll\u2019s, which markets conventional and organic berries. \u201cThere is a growing need for organic products because the demand is greater than the supply.\u201d\n\nMany consumers may not realize the extent to which giant corporations have come to dominate organic food. Then again, giant corporations don\u2019t exactly trumpet their role in the industry. Their financial motivation, however, is obvious. On Amazon.com, for instance, 12 six-ounce boxes of Kraft Organic Macaroni and Cheese sell for $25.32, while a dozen 7.25-ounce boxes of the company\u2019s regular Macaroni and Cheese go for $19.64.\n\n\u201cAs soon as a value-added aspect was established, it didn\u2019t take long before corporate America came knocking,\u201d Mr. Potter says. He says he gets at least one e-mail a week from someone seeking to buy Eden, which is based in Clinton, Mich., and does about $50 million a year in sales. \u201cCompanies, private equity, venture capital, even individuals,\u201d Mr. Potter says. \u201cThe best offer I ever got came from two guys who had money from Super Glue.\u201d\n\nBetween the time the Agriculture Department came up with its proposed regulations for the organic industry in 1997 and the time those rules became law in 2002, myriad small, independent organic companies \u2014 from Honest Tea to Cascadian Farm \u2014 were snapped up by corporate titans. Heinz and Hain together bought 19 organic brands.\n\nEden is one of the last remaining independent organic companies of any size, together with the Clif Bar & Company, Amy\u2019s Kitchen, Lundberg Family Farms and a handful of others.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, organic is a victim of its own success,\u201d says Philip H. Howard, an assistant professor at Michigan State University, who has documented the remarkable consolidation of the organic industry. Organic food accounts for just 4 percent of all foods sold, but the industry is growing fast. \u201cBig corporations see the trends and the opportunity to make money and profit,\u201d he says.\n\nBIG FOOD has also assumed a powerful role in setting the standards for organic foods. Major corporations have come to dominate the board that sets these standards.\n\nAs corporate membership on the board has increased, so, too, has the number of nonorganic materials approved for organic foods on what is called the National List. At first, the list was largely made up of things like baking soda, which is nonorganic but essential to making things like organic bread. Today, more than 250 nonorganic substances are on the list, up from 77 in 2002.",

    "text": "PARIS \u2014 Shortly after pro-Russian troops infiltrated Crimea last weekend, the phone in Alexis Rodzianko\u2019s Moscow office started ringing. He is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, and local managers for some of the world\u2019s biggest brands were calling to discuss the safety of their operations and the risks that might arise if the West were to impose sanctions.\n\nA few miles away, at the Association of European Businesses, the main trade group for European multinationals, a similar scene unfolded. They all had an overarching concern: How hard might their Russian operations be hit if the turmoil kept escalating?\n\n\u201cForeign companies have seen many ups and downs in their relationship with Russia, and we hope this is just another one of them,\u201d Mr. Rodzianko said. \u201cBut this situation is full of uncertainties.\u201d\n\nWestern multinationals with big investments in Russia have faced other crises over the years. But the standoff between Russia and the West is posing a range of new challenges that threaten to undermine Western companies\u2019 business in Russia.\n\nAmerican companies including PepsiCo, McDonald\u2019s and John Deere are active in Russia, of course. But for many Western European businesses, that market is even more crucial.\n\nIn Paris, officials at the French carmaker Renault have been in constant contact with their Russia-based executives to assess the rapidly shifting climate in the country, where Renault has a pivotal joint venture. Directors at Porsche in Stuttgart, Germany, are analyzing political frictions. At the giant beer brewer Carlsberg, managers in Copenhagen are providing additional security for assets and employees in Russia and Ukraine, the company\u2019s biggest markets.\n\n\u201cRussia is important for European and American companies,\u201d said Chris Weafer, co-founder of Moscow-based Macro Advisory, a consulting firm. \u201cWith events escalating and bringing Russia into greater conflict with Western governments, there could be serious consequences.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest concerns is that international sanctions may hit Russia\u2019s large but increasingly sluggish economy and prod Moscow to retaliate against Western interests.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation in which those applying the sanctions will get hurt as much as the side being sanctioned,\u201d Mr. Rodzianko said.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s economy is tightly intertwined with Russia\u2019s. Europe does about $460 billion in business there, much of it in the energy sector, making it Moscow\u2019s largest trading partner. And more than half of Russia\u2019s foreign investment comes from European multinationals and financial institutions.\n\nThe United States is not even among Russia\u2019s top 10 trading partners, exchanging around $40 billion worth of exports and imports each year. And yet, Russia remains a crucial market for American retail, construction and energy companies, as well as some of the biggest United States banks.\n\nOn Thursday, the United States and its allies imposed visa bans on individuals deemed responsible for undermining Ukrainian sovereignty, and threatened further sanctions if Russia did not de-escalate tensions. The Kremlin warned of countermeasures, including possibly seizing American property in Russia.\n\nOn Friday night, the Russian government issued a statement saying that its foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, had spoken by telephone with Secretary of State John Kerry and warned that \u201chasty and ill-considered steps\u201d to impose sanctions on Russian officials would harm relations. The statement warned that sanctions \u201cwould inevitably backfire on the United States itself.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the week Russian lawmakers also considered a proposed law allowing for the confiscation of property, assets and accounts of Western companies. Other Russian officials advocated dropping the dollar as a reserve currency and refusing to pay off Russian loans to American banks.\n\nSo far, the Russian threats have been only that. But the tenor of the statements has made Western multinationals jittery.\n\nEuropean businesses \u201chave no interests in any deterioration of the current international situation linked to Ukraine,\u201d Frank Schauff, the chief executive of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, said on Friday. \u201cWe call upon all parties to engage in a constructive dialogue, which will secure stability, welfare and economic growth on the European Continent.\u201d\n\nEuropean Union leaders are not eager to pick an economics fight. A document photographed in the hands of a British official near 10 Downing Street this week and shown by the BBC read in part, \u201cThe U.K. should not support for now trade sanctions or close London\u2019s financial center to Russians.\u201d\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose economy has deep ties to Russia, has also been reluctant to rush into sanctions.\n\nThe visa bans announced so far will not hit Russia financially. But any trade curbs could be painful. After years of growth propelled by oil and natural gas, the Russian economy is already slumping toward a recession. The ruble has been increasingly volatile against the dollar and the euro, and dipped to record lows against those currencies after the Russians moved into Crimea.\n\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Stoll, head of sales at Renault, said in a recent interview that the company\u2019s top management was pondering what to do if a devalued ruble caused inflation to rise and undercut the buying power of Russian consumers.\n\nRenault executives are discussing \u201chow we can cope with the situation in case we have to raise our prices,\u201d Mr. Stoll said.\n\nBut the situation is still too fluid to gauge the impact, he said. \u201cWhen you have such a big financial crisis,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know how the situation will move.\u201d Asked whether Renault had expressed its concern to the Russian government, he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not our duty.\u201d\n\nAmerican companies are also nervously watching Russia. Those companies include Ford Motor, which operates three assembly plants in Russia and recently formed a joint venture there.\n\nThe John Deere Company, one of the world\u2019s biggest makers of farm equipment, has two factories and an operations office in Russia. \u201cWe have taken steps to ensure the safety of our employees and have restricted travel in the region,\u201d said Ken Golden, director of global public relations for Deere. Mr. Golden would not specify what those steps were.\n\nWhile Russia represents less than 5 percent of Deere\u2019s total equipment sales, the company recently cited Russia as being key to its future growth. \u201cWe urge political leaders to solve this issue without violence and in accord with international agreements,\u201d Mr. Golden said.\n\nRussia is Pepsi\u2019s largest market outside the United States, contributing nearly $5 billion in annual revenue, about 7 percent of the company\u2019s total. McDonald\u2019s also has a sizable presence. The fast-food giant, which was the official restaurant of the recent Olympic Games in Sochi, has 413 Russian restaurants generating $2.5 billion a year, or around 9 percent of the company\u2019s total revenue, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank Securities.\n\n\u201cRussia is a high-growth market, and it\u2019s important to them,\u201d said Jason West, a research analyst for Deutsche Bank. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how bad things are going to get yet, but it could really hurt growth prospects.\u201d\n\nNor are Russian companies immune to the turmoil. State-owned banks that could be the target of further Western sanctions were pounded this week on Russia\u2019s stock exchange. Shares in Gazprom, the behemoth Russian gas producer that sends gas through Ukraine to European markets, have also slumped.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, American and European companies are hunkering down. None yet seem ready to heed Mr. Kerry\u2019s admonition to \u201cstart thinking twice about whether they want to do business with a country that behaves like this.\u201d\n\nIt is not that simple, according to Mr. Rodzianko of the American Chamber.\n\n\u201cNobody is particularly happy with the fact that the business climate is suffering, but you don\u2019t come in here, build a plant, and pull out tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stick to our knitting, and deal with the setbacks until the climate improves.\u201d",

While Taiwan's figure seems alarming, it comes as no surprise; Huang notes that growth was barely above zero in 2014 after hovering below 1 percent for most of the past decade.\n\nIn a report last year, HSBC noted that the East Asian 'tigers' (South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore) were expected to age at rates even quicker than that of Japan.\n\nStudies of other population metrics in Taiwan also reveal worrisome trends.

Together they have the power effectively to veto anything the Parliament passes. Mr. Talabani has already expressed support for the new election law, and on Thursday Mr. Mahdi announced that he, too, would approve it.\n\nMr. Hashimi\u2019s aides suggested on Thursday that his concerns could be addressed by changes in the way Iraq\u2019s election commission allots seats in the new Parliament, rather than in changes in the newly amended election law. That would avoid a second veto, and thus more delays.\n\nA flurry of talks has taken place over the last three days, all behind closed doors. \u201cWe will not say everything is refused,\u201d Alaa Maki, a senior lawmaker close to Mr. Hashimi, said in a telephone interview, expressing optimism that a deal could be reached. At the same time, he insisted that the proportion of parliamentary seats given to each province should not change, as it would under the second proposed election law.\n\nNeither he nor other officials would discuss the details of a potential compromise. The initial election law reserved 5 percent of parliamentary seats for minority groups and Iraqi refugees; Mr. Hashimi said it should be 15 percent. The revised law would still reserve seats for minority groups, but count Iraqis abroad in the provinces they fled, rather than as a separate quota.\n\nMr. Maliki, in an interview with The Associated Press, strongly criticized Mr. Hashimi for upending what had been a carefully designed deal to hold the election in January. \u201cI think the issue has reached its peak,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think that it is in the interests of anybody that Mr. Tariq al-Hashimi continues to veto.

In Baghdad, four separate improvised bombs killed at least three people and wounded 16 others.",

Roberto Cazarez applied for U.S. citizenship shortly before he deployed for combat duty in Afghanistan.\n\nThe expedited process allows enlistees who are permanent legal residents, like Cazarez was, to go to the head of the line for citizenship.\n\nCazarez's application was pending at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services when he was killed by a roadside bomb blast in March, just weeks before his battalion was due to return to Camp Pendleton.\n\nOn Thursday, in a short but emotional ceremony, Cazarez's widow was presented with a certificate indicating that her husband had been posthumously awarded his U.S. citizenship, retroactive to the day that he was killed.\n\nCazarez, who was 24 when he died, is the 144th military service member to be posthumously awarded citizenship since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \u2014 more than in any other period of U.S. combat, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nOf the 144, 139 had served during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: 100 from the U.S. Army, 32 from the Marine Corps, six from the Navy and one from the National Guard.\n\nFellow Marines remembered Cazarez for his work as a driver in the 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, a unit assigned to roam the rugged desert of southern Afghanistan, locate Taliban fighters and engage them in direct combat.\n\n\"He was one of the most motivated Marines I've ever known,\" said Cpl. Bryant Nobles, who served with Cazarez in Afghanistan. \"If there was hard duty or heavy lifting to be done, he volunteered and never complained.\"\n\nThe ceremony was also an opportunity for officials to note the historic role of immigrants in the armed forces. According to the Pentagon, 35,000 noncitizens are on active duty and 12,000 serve in the Guard or Reserves.\n\n\"The U.S. military is built on a legacy of immigrant bravery,\" said Col. Michael Richardson, who represented the Marine Corps at the ceremony.\n\nIn some cases, posthumous citizenship can help surviving relatives seek entry into the United States. But that is not the case for Cazarez, whose family members are long-time U.S. residents with legal status, officials said.\n\nSonia Cazarez, 24, who is studying accounting at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo and living in Dana Point, said she sought citizenship for her husband because it was his last wish before deploying. She wears his ring and his dog tag on a chain around her neck.\n\n\"This really helps,\" she said, her voice breaking with tears. \"With all the grief, it's nice to see people honoring him for what he did as a Marine.\"\n\nCazarez came to the United States from the Mexican state of Sinaloa as a child. A permanent legal resident, he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2006, days after graduating from high school in Harbor City. He was on his second enlistment, his first combat tour.\n\n\"He came here as a baby and knew very little about Mexico; he always considered himself an American,\" Sonia Cazarez said. \"That's why this is so special.\"\n\nIn the months after Sept. 11, as U.S. involvement in Afghanistan escalated, President George W. Bush signed an executive order declaring that a \"time of conflict\" existed, allowing him to authorize the expedited citizenship process for service members. Since then, more than 83,000 military personnel have become U.S. citizens, more than 10,000 of them while stationed overseas.\n\nTo enlist in the military, someone must already be a permanent legal resident of the United States. When the expedited citizenship process is in effect, the three- or five-year waiting period for citizenship is waived for military personnel.\n\nBefore he deployed to Afghanistan, Cazarez also encouraged a nephew to enlist. Francisco Yahuaca, 18, is in boot camp in San Diego.\n\n\"We're a Marine family now,\" Sonia Cazarez said.",

    "text": "Malaysia\u2019s highest court has upheld a five-year prison sentence for opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on a sodomy charge in a controversial decision that will crush the political ambitions of the man and the movement who pose the most viable threat to the government\u2019s rule.\n\nAnwar, who has consistently maintained the charge against him was politically motivated, spoke to the judges from the dock, telling them they had become \u201cpartners in crime in the murder of judicial independence\u201d.\n\nTuesday\u2019s judgment and sentence marked a bitter end to a long-running legal saga for Anwar. The former deputy prime minister and his supporters insist the sodomy allegations were murky at best and designed to derail his career.\n\nSodomy is illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia. Anwar was first accused of sodomising a male political aide in 2008 but was ultimately acquitted of the charge by the high court in 2012.\n\nThe appeals court overturned the acquittal in March last year and sentenced him to five years\u2019 jail. He remained free on bail while that decision was appealed.\n\nTuesday\u2019s federal court decision to uphold the conviction \u2013 and the five-year sentence \u2013 exhausted Anwar\u2019s last avenue of appeal. He will go to prison immediately.\n\nAddressing the panel of five judges, Anwar said: \u201cYou have become partners in crime in the murder of judicial independence,\u201d prompting the judges to get up and walk out of the room, with one of them saying: \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear all this.\u201d\n\nAnwar continued speaking from the dock. \u201cAllah be my witness. I pledge that I will not be silenced. I will fight on for freedom and justice. I will never surrender.\u201d\n\nHis speech came during what are known as mitigation proceedings during which both sides are given an opportunity to speak before the judges decide the prison term.\n\n\u201cI maintain my innocence. This to me is a fabrication coming from a political conspiracy to stop my political career,\u201d Anwar said.\n\nEarlier, Justice Arifin Zakat, who read out the verdict, said there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that Anwar sodomised an aide and therefore the court was upholding the five-year sentence imposed by the appeals court last year.\n\nAnwar was the rising star of Malaysian politics in the mid-1990s before he fell out with then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nSince then the former deputy prime minister has been beset by legal problems and spent several years in prison after being convicted of corruption and an earlier sodomy charge.\n\nBut the charismatic Anwar, who heads a three-party opposition alliance, has remained the greatest threat to Malaysia\u2019s political establishment.\n\nOpposition gains in the 2013 general election raised the possibility of a genuine challenge to the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled Malaysia since 1957.\n\nThe rejection of Anwar\u2019s appeal is expected to spark protests across the country, though the man himself has appealed for calm.\n\nThe ruling appears to disqualify the 67-year-old from political office and from contesting the next election, which must be held by 2018.\n\nGooi Hsiao Leung, an MP in Anwar\u2019s People\u2019s Justice party, told the Guardian the mood among Anwar supporters in the courtroom was one of disbelief at the verdict.\n\n\u201cWe are very disappointed. His family was especially shocked, especially his wife, and his children and grandchildren, who were in court. They were in tears at the verdict.\n\n\u201cBased on the evidence and the case presented, we were hoping very strongly the case would be ruled in Anwar\u2019s favour. There were so many holes and inconsistencies and doubts from the very beginning of this case.\u201d\n\nGooi said the former aide who alleged he had been sodomised by Anwar had met with senior government politicians, and police officers, in the days just before making his complaint.\n\n\u201cJust on that alone there are serious suspicions about this case. From the beginning this has been a politically motivated case. For many years it was hoped the judiciary in this country would be seen as independent. This will reflect very negatively for Malaysia.\u201d\n\nThe UN human rights office said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the ruling.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line for us is the charge in this case should not be a criminal offence,\u201d said spokesman Rupert Colville.\n\nPhil Robertson, Asia spokesman for Human Rights Watch, described the court\u2019s verdict as a \u201ctravesty\u201d.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Najib Razak\u2019s government has persisted in its politically motivated prosecution of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim at the expense of democratic freedoms and the rights to non-discrimination and privacy for all Malaysians,\u201d he said from Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\u201cAllowing this travesty of justice to stand will further undermine respect for rights and democracy in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nRazak\u2019s government has rejected any suggestion of interference in the case, saying Malaysia has an independent judiciary and politics played no part in the court decision.\n\nAfter the verdict a spokesman for the Malaysian government said the judges reached their verdict only after considering all the evidence \u201cin a balanced and objective manner\u201d.\n\n\u201cMalaysia has an independent judiciary and there have been many rulings against senior government figures.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman said the charge against Anwar was brought by a private individual \u2013 Anwar\u2019s employee and personal assistant \u2013 not by the government. \u201cAs the victim of a serious assault he had every right to have his case heard in court.\n\n\u201cIn this case, exhaustive and comprehensive due process has been followed over many years. That process is now complete and we call on all parties involved to respect the legal process and judgment.\u201d\n\nPolice called on Anwar\u2019s supporters to maintain calm and security at the court was tightened. Last year he appealed to supporters to shun violence.\n\nAnwar\u2019s jailing could herald the disintegration of the three-party alliance he leads. It is paralysed with infighting and a meeting on Sunday to iron out differences and find a possible successor to Anwar was inconclusive.",

Police said members of the public should call 911 if Stone was seen and residents should remain inside with doors locked until he was apprehended.\n\n\u201cAs we stand here right now, we don\u2019t know where he is,\u201d Montgomery county district attorney Risa Ferman said in a Monday night press conference.\n\nInvestigators recovered Stone\u2019s vehicle and personal cellphone. The last he was seen was when he brought his two children to a neighbor\u2019s home. \u201cIt\u2019s of great significance that the children are safe right now,\u201d Ferman said.\n\nFerman said the events began with a 911 hang-up call from one of the three residences that authorities believe Stone targeted. First responders found Stone\u2019s former mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law dead at the residence.\n\nAt about 4.55am on Monday the neighbor of Stone\u2019s ex-wife Nicole Stone made a 911 call. She was later found dead at her home.\n\nFerman said the first people killed were Nicole Stone\u2019s sister and brother-in-law and their 14-year-old daughter. Their 17-year-old son was found injured and was being treated at a hospital.",

    "text": "Not so long ago, a sailor navigating the cold waters of the northern Pacific Ocean might have had every chance of being confronted by a giant cow.\n\nThis cow would have measured 10 metres long, and weighed between five and ten tonnes.\n\nAnd it would have been the most adept swimmer, spending its days cruising the seas, grazing on fields of grass growing underwater.\n\nThe cow in question was known as Steller\u2019s sea cow. It is now extinct, having left this earth almost 250 years ago.\n\nBut many people are unaware that such a huge and extraordinary creature once existed, or know its incredible story.\n\nAnd even today, scientists are still discovering fundamental insights into the life and history of this huge, lumbering, but almost mystical animal.\n\nSteller\u2019s sea cow was much, much bigger\n\nSteller\u2019s sea cow didn\u2019t look anything like the modern cows we rear for meat and milk.\n\nIt belonged to a different group of mammals, known as the Sirenia, named after the mermaids of Greek mythology that were known as sirens.\n\nToday, four species of Sirenia still exist, grouped into two distinct families.\n\nOne, the dugong (Dugong dugon) of South East Asia, measures some 3 metres long, weighing around 400 kg.\n\nThere are also three species of manatee; the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), and the West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis). These can grow to 4 metres long and weigh almost 600 kg, and the three species of manatee are more closely related to each other than the dugong.\n\nAll have large rotund bodies, downturned snouts, short rounded paddle-like flippers, and a horizontal tail fluke that they use to move around.\n\nHunters may have killed seven times as many sea cows as they could eat\n\nBut Steller\u2019s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) was much, much bigger. It reached a length of 10 metres and different sources suggest it could have weighed anywhere between 4,000-11,000 kgs.\n\nIt also lacked teeth, surviving by using a pair of broad horny pads to chew kelp.\n\nSurprisingly perhaps, the first recorded sighting of a Steller\u2019s sea cow didn\u2019t happen until 1741, when a sailing expedition led by Captain Vitus Bering of the Russian Navy was marooned on an desolate, treeless uninhabited island, later named Bering Island, in what is today known as the Bering Sea.\n\nThe sailors survived by hunting and eating the huge sea cow.\n\nThey documented its habits and number, with estimates suggesting that perhaps 1500 or fewer lived around the island.\n\nThe dugong now survives as the only truly herbivorous marine mammal\n\nLike its modern relatives, the sea cow aggregated in herds. That and its slow-moving, almost docile behaviour made it easy prey.\n\nThe sea cow was studied by a single scientist, Georg Steller, after whom the species is named.\n\nSteller described the sea cow\u2019s 3 to 4-inch thick blubber as tasting something like almond oil, which might have played an unfortunate role in its demise.\n\nThose sailors that escaped Bering Island spread word of the bounty of meat to be found off its shores. Each year new expeditions hunted the animals.\n\nOne report stated that one sea cow could feed 33 men for a month, and it was thought sailors stored the meat on ships to feed themselves on voyages lasting up to a year.\n\nEarlier in their history, the first sirenians may have been hippo-sized\n\nIncredibly, the last sea cow was reported killed in 1768, just 27 years after the island and species had been discovered by modern man.\n\nScientists have since tried to establish whether these hunting expeditions killed off the sea cow, or whether other factors played a role.\n\nOne idea is that humans also hunted sea otters on the island. These otters fed on sea urchins, and the otters' absence caused an explosion in sea urchin numbers.\n\nThis plague of sea urchins then ate all the shallow kelp on the sea floor, removing the main food source of Steller\u2019s sea cow, essentially starving the population to death.\n\nBut studies now suggest this was unlikely and humans did hunt the sea cows far faster than they could reproduce. Hunters may have even killed seven times as many sea cows as they could eat, using wasteful primitive hunting methods, assuming there was an almost infinite supply.\n\nAs a result humans drove Steller\u2019s sea cow extinct within three decades.\n\nThat makes Steller\u2019s sea cow one of the few truly large mammals known to have been driven extinct in the modern age.\n\nSirenians are also special as they are one of only two major groups of mammals to have evolved an aquatic lifestyle that allowed them to colonise the oceans.\n\nWhales aside, the gargantuan Steller\u2019s sea cow may have been the largest mammal to live in the modern age\n\nA new genetic analysis, published in the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, has now established which animal still living today is the closest relative of the Steller's sea cow.\n\nA survey of the genes held in the nucleus of the animals\u2019 cells confirms that dugongs, rather than manatees, are more closely related to Steller's sea cows.\n\nThe dugong now survives as the only truly herbivorous marine mammal, as manatees often frequent fresh water.\n\nMany more dugongs are known to have existed in the past, with at least 19 different genera being known from a fossil record that extends back to the Eocene.\n\nThere is one other extraordinary thing about these animals: all sirenians may be more closely related to elephants than any other groups of mammals.\n\nEarlier in their history, the first sirenians may have been hippo-sized, four-legged animals that waded into the water to feed on marine algae and sea grasses, learning to swim, only later evolving truly aquatic bodies.\n\nThat culminated in the gargantuan Steller\u2019s sea cow, which whales aside, may well have been the largest mammal to live in the modern age.\n\nFollow Matt Walker and BBC Earth on twitter.",

    "text": "DAKAR, Senegal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Barack Obama had been a United States senator for just weeks in early 2005 when Oprah Winfrey offered to carry a message for him to Nelson Mandela, the iconic South African leader.\n\nMr. Obama disappeared into a back room in Ms. Winfrey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s television studio to write the note, but he was gone so long that his spokesman, Robert Gibbs, popped his head in after half an hour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to give me some time here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Obama, pen in hand, told Mr. Gibbs, who recalled the moment recently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just wing a note to Nelson Mandela.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Obama had been hoping to have his first face-to-face meeting as president with the ailing 94-year-old leader during a three-country, weeklong trip to Africa that began on Wednesday. But Mr. Mandela was hospitalized on June 8 for a chronic lung infection, and on Thursday he remained in critical but stable condition.\n\nA meeting between Mr. Mandela and Mr. Obama would have been rich with symbolism and symmetry for people on both continents: two men from different generations who made history as the first black presidents of nations with deep racial divides. Both embraced a cool pragmatism in their attempt to be post-racial leaders, and both have inspired as well as disappointed many supporters.\n\nMr. Mandela has long been a beacon for Mr. Obama, who recounted again on Thursday how the revolution unleashed by Mr. Mandela a world away had inspired his own activisim. Friends of Mr. Obama say that for him and many of his contemporaries, the fight against apartheid was the equivalent of the civil rights movement of an earlier generation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy first act of political activism was when I was at Occidental College,'\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Obama said at Thursday at a news conference here in Dakar, referring to a brief speech he gave at the time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI got involved in the anti-apartheid movement, back in 1979-80 because I was inspired by what was taking place in South Africa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRecalling Mr. Mandela's long imprisonment, Mr. Obama said that \"I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily imagine that Nelson Mandela might be released.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Obama rarely dwells on his own strides against racial barriers and has for the most part steered away from invoking Mr. Mandela\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggles in public or in private. Aides say he considers it presumptuous to compare his own life with that of Mr. Mandela, who was imprisoned for 27 years, part of that time in a tiny cell on Robben Island, before forging an end to apartheid and becoming South Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first black leader.\n\nBut Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closest advisers say people do not realize how much Mr. Mandela has been an inspiration to Mr. Obama in some of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most difficult moments. Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser and close friend of Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, said that Mr. Mandela had given Mr. Obama \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe strength to persevere.'\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn the foreword that Mr. Obama wrote to Mr. Mandela\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2010 book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cConversations With Myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he describes the early impact that Mr. Mandela\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggle had on his life and his entry into politics.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis sacrifice was so great that it called upon people everywhere to do what they could on behalf of human progress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Obama wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the most modest of ways, I was one of those people who tried to answer his call.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Obama hinted in the foreword at what might be his most important lesson from Mr. Mandela\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggles, the need to be stubborn in the face of obstacles. Like Mr. Mandela, who angered some black South Africans who wanted a more radical reordering of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wealth, Mr. Obama has sometimes disillusioned his most ardent supporters.\n\nMr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embrace of some of his predecessor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antiterrorism policies has frustrated liberals. Revelations about secret surveillance programs haves prompted concerns about privacy. And frequent budget clashes with Congress have left those who expected a new tone in Washington disillusioned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of us face days when it can seem like change is hard \u00e2\u0080\u0094 days when our opposition and our own imperfections may tempt us to take an easier path that avoids our responsibilities to one another,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Obama wrote in the foreword. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut even when little sunlight shined into that Robben Island cell, he could see a better future \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one worthy of sacrifice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn 2006, Mr. Obama stood inside that cell during a visit to South Africa as a senator. After the tour, Mr. Gibbs remembered Mr. Obama as quiet and somber.\n\nLydia Polgreen contributed reporting from Johannesburg.",

    "text": "Crisis Points follows the unrest as it develops in Egypt and the Middle East. CAIRO \u2014 It is a beautiful Friday morning in Cairo.\n\nCrisis Points follows the unrest as it develops in Egypt and the Middle East.\n\nThe absence of heavy car traffic over the past 10 days has given this city the cleanest air I ever remember breathing. Outside my window it\u2019s crisp with bright blue skies and a smattering of little clouds in wondrous shapes previously concealed by the infamous Cairo morning smog.\n\nIn my post-Mubarak time zone it\u2019s Departure Friday, and it\u2019s been called that for at least three days now. We don\u2019t greet each other with the usual bland good mornings we are used to. No. It\u2019s on a cheerful note of \u201cdeparture morning!\u201d that we begin and end our conversations. Other people inhabiting other time zones \u2014 family, colleagues, friends, and the odd man on the street \u2014 have increasingly come to view us as an enemy at the gate, our morning greeting an irresponsible act of drunkenness, and some of us secretly wonder if it\u2019s true.\n\nWe were called \u201ctraitors\u201d yesterday by random strangers as friends and crossed Kasr El Nil Bridge to Tahrir Square, carrying food and medical supplies to those who survived into the morning after Wednesday night\u2019s violence. People we don\u2019t know yelled at us: \u201cYou\u2019re not Egyptian! You know nothing about this country!\u201d Later on we were told other pro-democracy folks had their supplies seized by pro-Mubarak men on the bridge, who then proceeded to chuck said supplies into the Nile. At a pharmacy earlier, a friend was asked by the salesman if the supplies were for Tahrir, and when she said yes, he proceeded to explain why she\u2019s personally responsible for Egypt\u2019s imminent spiral into a tunnel of horrors, a massive conspiracy by inside and outside forces that seek to bring Egypt down.\n\nDepending on who you talk to, Egypt now stands against the biggest and oddest axis of evil ever known to humanity, something far surpassing the wildest neocon fantasies: Against Egypt\u2019s domestic tranquility stands Israel allied with Iran allied with Saudi Arabia allied with Hamas allied with America allied with Hezbollah allied with the European Union allied with the Muslim Brotherhood allied with Jordan allied with Islamic Jihad allied with Turkey allied with the Egyptian Army allied with Baradei allied with Mubarak \u2026. I mean, seriously!\n\nYes. In other time zones they blame any odd number of the above galactic evil axis as responsible for what\u2019s going on now. Like Mubarak aptly put it to Christiane Amanpour on TV yesterday, it is not in Egyptian \u201cculture\u201d to revolt. It is not in us to take ourselves seriously and stand up to a corrupt ruler and his elite. So it must be the Muslim Brotherhood fomenting the protests, or at least waiting to hijack their result and ride into power. Or it\u2019s Iran meddling again. Or it\u2019s obstinate youth who won\u2019t listen to reason and are now jeopardizing our system, causing it to fall into the military\u2019s lap. Or it\u2019s America allied with Baradei protecting Israel\u2019s security and engineering Mubarak\u2019s succession by Suleiman, the trustworthy head of Egyptian intelligence. Or it\u2019s Israel instinctively seeking to destabilize Egypt, risking the peace treaty in the process.\n\nOr. Or. Or \u2026 Whatever it is, what\u2019s happening on the ground cannot be a real revolution, because Egyptians don\u2019t revolt in that other time zone. The passive fellahin on the Nile are an eternal symbol not to be meddled with, please.\n\nWhat these different theories ultimately do is increase the level of fear among the people about what will happen next, and bring many to support the pro-Mubarak hooligans being paid to beat up demonstrators. It\u2019s not just the capitalist and police elites who believe this. It\u2019s also my cousin and my best friend and my work colleague who are stuck in that Mubarak twilight zone and want him to stay after the promises he made two days ago. They want him to stay just for a while, just for six months, just to oversee the transition, just so that the country doesn\u2019t plunge into violence and chaos. Again, like Mubarak told Amanpour last night, he would love to leave office immediately, were it not for Egypt\u2019s security that he so zealously cares for.\n\nIn the post-Mubarak time zone, this is all malicious hogwash intended to split the people, and splitting us it is. This Facebook revolution, as some have come to call it, is appropriately now witnessing Facebook purges. Friends are removing others from their \u201cfriend\u201d list over pro- and anti-Mubarak positions that seem to change by the day. I\u2019ve stopped talking to my cousin and almost fell out with a good friend. And when I do my best to listen carefully to their reasoning, why Mubarak should be given a safe and dignified exit from Egypt, I understand where they\u2019re coming from, and must admit sometimes feel that their time zone reasoning prevails, that the country is indeed in danger, that enough is enough and that Tahrir, Liberation Square, must be liberated from its demonstrators for Egypt\u2019s sake.\n\nThese are the fears of last night, a dark night of the soul, when I wondered with neighbors patrolling our police-free streets if the spirit in Tahrir, wherever it came from, is real and true? We weigh one logical analysis of the situation against another. We argue and argue back, we joke and laugh and do our best to hide the fact that we\u2019re all really scared. Above all, we hide from the fact that the reasoning and policy discussions are inconclusive in their results, that as we go back home to sleep in the early morning, our minds are still not made up.\n\nAt these times only faith can save us, faith in the ability of the people to know right from wrong, to recognize the tastes of freedom and oppression, to tell without thought the difference and act on it by intuition alone.\n\nA good departure morning to whomever is reading this!\n\nAmr Shalakany is associate professor of law at the American University in Cairo.",

    "text": "The 2012 London Games mark the 20th anniversary of my first Olympics.\n\nThose Barcelona Games were romantic and historic: South Africa was readmitted to the Olympic family, and Cuban boxers put on a demonstration for the ages.\n\nFor the United States, the London Games will mark a more vexing anniversary: the compromising \u2014 some might say the corruption \u2014 of an ideal with the introduction of the Dream Team to the Olympic movement.\n\nIn 1988, the United States Olympic men\u2019s basketball team, made up of the top college players, wound up with a bronze medal. Until then, it had always been a source of pride that our top college players could go toe to toe with older, more experienced players around the world and win. But after that loss in Seoul, South Korea, the United States panicked and called in the Marines. The Dream Team scheme was hatched.\n\nThe Dream Team became a marketer\u2019s dream. The world\u2019s greatest players were each a commodity unto himself: Michael Jordan. Larry Bird. Magic Johnson. Charles Barkley. Patrick Ewing. Karl Malone.\n\nBut the introduction of N.B.A. players stripped away any pretense of innocence and amateurism and made it clear that our priority was winning the gold.\n\nIndeed, the most symbolic Dream Team moment came during the medal ceremony when Jordan draped himself in the American flag \u2014 not out of patriotism but to cover the Reebok logo on his warm-ups. Jordan, of course, endorsed Nike.\n\nWhen you mix ego (wanting to avenge an Olympic defeat) with capitalism (marketing a team of star players), you get compromised idealism.\n\nThe Dream Team\u2019s creation ultimately led to the atmosphere that prompted two star players to suggest last month that N.B.A. players should be paid to play in the Olympics.\n\nThe Miami Heat\u2019s Dwyane Wade, who was 10 when the Dream Team made its debut in Barcelona, and the Boston Celtics\u2019 Ray Allen suggested that N.B.A. Olympians be compensated. The suggestion was merely an extension of the pay-for-play foundation laid by the N.B.A. and USA Basketball in 1992.\n\nThis is a concept whose time has come. Actually, it is overdue.\n\nN.B.A. players have become the Olympics\u2019 big-name ticket and marketing magnets. While gymnasts and swimmers and runners and all the rest add to the excitement, they are forgotten, barring spectacular performances, the second the events are over. Memories of the basketball players, with the next N.B.A. season mere months away, live on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of things you do for the Olympics \u2014 a lot of jerseys you sell,\u201d Wade told reporters last month. \u201cWe play the whole summer. I do think guys should be compensated.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is now you get no rest. So you go to the end of the season; training camp is two weeks later. You\u2019re giving up a lot to do it. It\u2019s something you want to do, but it\u2019s taxing on your body. You\u2019re not playing for the dollar. But it would be nice if you would get compensated.\u201d\n\nUSA Basketball officials attempted to minimize the issue. Jerry Colangelo, the director of USA Basketball, said: \u201cAfterward, Dwyane recognized that really wasn\u2019t what he meant. He didn\u2019t want it to be a real issue because he certainly has shown his dedication. It was over within 24, 48 hours.\u201d\n\nMike Krzyzewski, the national team coach, told reporters: \u201cOur guys understand the privilege of playing for our country, and serving our country in a basketball sense is a privilege we truly appreciated. There is no need for money.\u201d\n\nClearly, Wade and Allen disagree. For veteran N.B.A. players, being an Olympian is as much work as it is an honor. And if you lose, there is no honor.\n\nOscar Robertson, a Basketball Hall of Famer and Olympian himself, said he thought that compensation for Olympians should definitely be on the table.\n\nBefore the Dream Team, Robertson\u2019s 1960 Olympic team had been called the best ever. They were college and amateur players, and Robertson concedes that he did not have the same view of the Olympics at 21 that he would have at 31, let alone now at 73. And the modern N.B.A. player has a firmer hand on the business of the game, including the Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt was a totally different story,\u201d Robertson said in an interview last week. \u201cAt that time, you just wanted to play basketball. You heard about the Russians and Yugoslavians and Italians. You just wanted to go out and beat them. It was competitive.",

The company is nonetheless warning customers and providing advice on how to fix the problem.\n\n\"The probability of unauthorized access to the OneTouch Ping system is extremely low,\" the company said in letters sent on Monday to doctors and about 114,000 patients who use the device in the United States and Canada.\n\n\"It would require technical expertise, sophisticated equipment and proximity to the pump, as the OneTouch Ping system is not connected to the internet or to any external network.\"\n\nA copy of the text of the letter was made available to Reuters.\n\nInsulin pumps are medical devices that patients attach to their bodies that injects insulin through catheters.\n\nThe Animas OneTouch Ping, which was launched in 2008, is sold with a wireless remote control that patients can use to order the pump to dose insulin so that they do not need access to the device itself, which is typically worn under clothing and can be awkward to reach.\n\nJay Radcliffe, a diabetic and researcher with cyber security firm Rapid7 Inc, said he had identified ways for a hacker to spoof communications between the remote control and the OneTouch Ping insulin pump, potentially forcing it to deliver unauthorized insulin injections.\n\nThe system is vulnerable because those communications are not encrypted, or scrambled, to prevent hackers from gaining access to the device, said Radcliffe, who reported vulnerabilities in the pump to J&J in April and published them on the Rapid7 blog on Tuesday.\n\nJ&J executives said they worked on the security issues with Radcliffe.\n\nDosing a patient with too much insulin could cause hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, which in extreme cases can be life threatening, said Brian Levy, chief medical officer with J&J's diabetes unit.\n\nCompany technicians were able to replicate Radcliffe's findings, confirming that a hacker could order the pump to dose insulin from a distance of up to 25 feet, Levy said. He said such attacks are difficult to pull off because they require specialized technical expertise and sophisticated equipment.\n\n\"We believe the OneTouch Ping system is safe and reliable. We urge patients to stay on the product,\" Levy said.\n\nJ&J's letter said that if patients were concerned, they could take several steps to thwart potential attacks. They include discontinuing use of a wireless remote control and programming the pump to limit the maximum insulin dose.\n\nFDA GUIDANCE ON MEDICAL DEVICES\n\nIn August, a prominent short seller and a cyber security research firm went public with allegations of potentially life-threatening cyber vulnerabilities in heart devices from St. Jude Medical Inc.\n\nAs its shares tumbled, St. Jude said the allegations were false, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began an investigation.\n\nThe FDA is preparing to issue formal guidance on how medical device makers should handle reports about cyber vulnerabilities.\n\nAn early draft of that guidance, which was released in January for public comments, called for device makers to work with security researchers, identify steps to mitigate risks, and provide patients with information about bugs so they can \"make informed decisions\" about device use.\n\nThe FDA declined to comment on J&J's handling of the vulnerability in the insulin pump.\n\nJ&J said it had reviewed the matter with the FDA before sending the letters.\n\nRadcliffe said he believed that OneTouch Ping users would be safe if they followed the steps outlined in the letters from J&J.\n\n\"They can give peace of mind to the patient or parent of a child using the device,\" he said.\n\nJ&J Chief Information Security Officer Marene Allison said her team would make sure other J&J products do not have similar bugs.\n\nRadcliffe said he found vulnerabilities in the Animas OneTouch Ping, but not the Animas Vibe line of insulin pumps.\n\nSuzanne Schwartz, an FDA official responsible for reviewing bugs in medical devices, said in a statement that she encourages collaboration between researchers and device manufacturers to identify, remediate and alert the public to vulnerabilities.\n\n\"It enables all stakeholders to better address device safety with the interest of patient health in mind,\" she said.\n\nThe FDA has said it knows of no cases where hackers have exploited cyber vulnerabilities to harm a patient.\n\nThe agency last year issued multiple warnings about cyber bugs in infusion pumps from Hospira, which has since been acquired by Pfizer Inc.",

The alleged gunman,\n\n, 22, has been declared mentally incompetent to stand trial, but his prosecution could go forward if his condition improves.\n\nIn the new photos, the Tucson Democrat's hair is dark and closely cropped, rather than the shoulder-length blond style she wore before the Jan. 8 assassination attempt. But her beaming smile is intact.\n\nOne of the photos is posed, with Giffords looking directly at the camera. The other is more casual and shows her sitting alongside her mother, Gloria Giffords.\n\nGiffords spokesman C.J. Karamargin said Sunday that the photos were intended to help satisfy \"intense interest in the congresswoman's appearance.\"\n\nHer staff hopes the images will reduce unwanted photography when she begins visiting an outpatient clinic.\n\n\"What we wanted to avoid was a paparazzi-like frenzy,\" he told the Associated Press.\n\nHer staff hopes Giffords will be released from the hospital within the next month, he said. After that, she'll receive outpatient therapy.\n\nDuring an interview with the Arizona Republic published last week, Chief of Staff Pia Carusone was asked when the public would get a look at Giffords.\n\n\"This is a one-step-at-a-time process,\" Carusone said. \"I think that we're getting close to the time when Gabby will feel comfortable releasing a photo. Then, we go from there.\"\n\nThe latest photos were taken by photojournalist P.K. Weis of SouthwestPhotoBank.com, a longtime photographer for the now-defunct Tucson Citizen who has known Giffords for more than a decade.\n\nWeis took the pictures at the Houston rehabilitation center where Giffords is being treated. The photo session occurred the day before she underwent a cranioplasty to repair part of her skull that was removed because of brain swelling \u2014 and the day after the launch of the space shuttle Endeavour, a mission commanded by her husband,\n\nin Florida to see the launch but did not appear in public.\n\n\"Any photographer in the country would have loved the opportunity to take these pictures and I was delighted to be asked,\" Weis said in a statement.\n\n\"It was very inspiring to see how much she had recovered in 4 1/2 months,\" he added. \"I was excited to see her and to see her smile. She was glad to see me, was in a good mood, smiling and laughing and seemed to enjoy the experience. I certainly did too.\"\n\nFacebook fans also sounded thrilled.\n\n\"The same smile, the same attitude,\" a woman said. \"We can't wait until you are back in Congress!\"\n\n\"We love Gabby Giffords,\" a man wrote. \"Her name will go down in history and her beautiful face is etched into our hearts. Her lovely new photo made our day! We send blessings and prayers every day, every hour. We can't wait to see her back in Tucson.\"\n\nGiffords' staff has indicated that it hopes she will be released from TIRR Memorial Hermann hospital in Houston within the next month, but cautioned that she has a long road ahead.\n\n\"If she were to plateau today, and this was as far as she gets, it would not be nearly the quality of life she had before,\" Carusone said in the Arizona Republic interview. \"There's no comparison. All that we can hope for is that she won't plateau today and that she'll keep going and that when she does plateau, it will be at a place far away from here.\"\n\nCarusone told the Republic that Giffords was having trouble finding words and forming sentences. She was shot in the area of the brain that governs language, and shards of the bullet remain in her head.\n\nWasserman Schultz said she and Giffords spoke on the phone Wednesday for the first time since the shooting.\n\n\"She spoke to me in full sentences, initiated those sentences, instead of just responding, which is what she'd really only been able to do recently,\" Schultz said on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\n\"And she's making remarkable progress. We're so proud of her. She's working so hard. She's got a long way to go. But you can just see how beautiful she is, and we are longing and looking forward to her coming back.\"",

    "text": "At her impeachment trial this week, Brazil's suspended president Dilma Rousseff warned of the \"death of democracy,\" comparing the senators trying her to the military tribunal she faced as a young woman fighting dictatorship.\n\nThe actual charges against Rousseff -- which she has denied, and for which she was impeached on Wednesday -- are more mundane: that she manipulated the federal budget to hide Brazil's true economic condition, and spent money without congressional approval. Yet they point to one of Brazil's biggest problems: the persistent abuse of state resources to advance partisan or personal fortunes, with huge costs for the country at large.\n\nThe fiscal responsibility law that Rousseff was accused of violating is intended to prevent unauthorized spending, balance government accounts and save future administrations from having to pay for their predecessors' populist sprees. By delaying repayments to state-owned banks for social programs, Rousseff's administration was able to bust its own budget while seeming to stay within legal bounds. In fact, this strategy enabled the government to \"overspend\" by tens of billions of dollars from 2012 through 2015, in part to pay for Rousseff's expansive re-election promises.\n\nQuickTake Brazil's Highs and Lows\n\nRousseff's defenders argue that her behavior was no different from her predecessors' and that her accusers face their own serious ethical challenges. The latter assertion is certainly true. But neither is an excuse. Over the past two years, Brazil's budget deficit has more than tripled to around 10 percent of gross domestic product, making it that much harder to revive an economy in recession.\n\nAt its worst, Brazil\u2019s statist fiscal chicanery has helped underwrite fat subsidies to big companies that are political contributors, feeding the same toxic nexus that gave rise to the multi-billion dollar Petrobras scandal. It has also hindered an honest public debate about Brazil\u2019s generous social welfare programs. While some of these have lifted millions of Brazilians from poverty, others \u2013- especially pensions -- have added to the country\u2019s enormous fiscal burden. Hence Rousseff\u2019s alleged attempts at creative accounting when hard times hit Brazil.\n\nNow, acting President Michel Temer faces the hard task of cutting spending even as unemployment rises. He has already won legislative concessions to make Brazil\u2019s budgeting more flexible and introduce a temporary spending cap. While his proposal for badly needed pension reform will prove controversial, especially with municipal elections slated for October, he has no choice but to push ahead.\n\nIn the short term, Temer\u2019s best bet is to spur growth by making Brazil\u2019s economy more attractive to outside investors, whether by allowing greater participation in sectors such as oil and aviation, streamlining Brazil\u2019s onerous labor laws, boosting trade (which accounts for a tiny share of GDP), and reducing political meddling in ministries and state-owned enterprises.\n\nUnfortunately, the Temer administration\u2019s predictions for economic growth next year (and rising tax revenues) outstrip most estimates. Future Brazilian leaders should consider Rousseff\u2019s fate a salutary warning against too-rosy scenarios and the fiscal fiddling that accompanies them.\n\nTo contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg View\u2019s editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net.",

    "text": "The move toward driverless vehicles is accelerating with technology such as Tesla's new Autopilot.\n\nAnd that means there are already self-driving cars on Canadian highways.\n\nSome Tesla owners are pushing the limits of the technology and posting some crazy videos online to prove it.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla offered an optional $3,000 software update for every Model S built after 2014. The update installs Autopilot, Tesla's automation system, which is just about the closest thing to autonomous driving available to the public right now.\n\nAutopilot combines adaptive cruise control, automatic lane control, hands-free lane changes, 360-degree collision warning and automatic parking, where the car can look for a parking space and park on command.\n\nIt does this using a combination of cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors and previously acquired data that has been uploaded from other Tesla vehicles.\n\n\"I drove this model S [from Toronto] to Montreal, pretty much in Autopilot the whole way,\" said Martin Paquet, regional sales manager for Tesla Canada.\n\nPaquet took a CBC crew for an extended test drive in a Tesla Model S P85D. It has 700 horsepower, a battery range of about 400 kilometres and a price tag of about $150,000 as tested.\n\nOur test drive took place on a busy highway in Toronto in a mix of traffic conditions.\n\nTo engage Autopilot, the driver pulls twice on a lever on the left side of the steering wheel. Pushing the lever once in the opposite direction turns it off.\n\nThe driver sets a top speed \u2014 in our case, the speed limit of 90 km/h \u2014 and sets the distance maintained from the vehicle in front \u2014 one to seven car lengths \u2014 by toggling on the same lever.\n\nTo change lanes, the driver hits the turn signal and, if the vehicle doesn't detect another alongside, it automatically moves over.\n\nThe system feels very smooth when braking and accelerating and when changing lanes. On long curves, the system is designed to stay in the centre of the lane, and the car wiggles a tiny bit as the system continually corrects.\n\nEvery once in a while, a chime sounds reminding the driver to touch the steering wheel. If this doesn't happen, the vehicle is designed to come to a controlled stop.\n\nTesla says the system is designed for highway travel.\n\n\"Really intended for on-ramp to off-ramp. Similar to autopilot for a plane. You wouldn't want the pilot to disappear halfway through the flight. You want the pilot to make sure that you take off and land properly,\" said Paquet\n\nBut some Tesla owners have been posting videos online of themselves engaged in some questionable driving activity, like this guy reading a newspaper while driving, or this guy brushing his teeth and reading a book. Tesla has made it clear this is not the way Autopilot is intended to be used.\n\nExperts say the laws around this level of automation are a grey area.\n\nOntario will start allowing the testing of fully autonomous vehicles on roads and highways in January.\n\nIt says a driver will have to be physically present in the vehicle and remain in the driver's seat at all times. Those testing an autonomous vehicle will have to be licensed and registered and will have to apply to the Ministry of Transportation. A copy of the permit will need to be kept in the vehicle at all times and produced if stopped by a police officer.\n\nAnd those participating in the pilot program will be required to have minimum liability coverage of $5 million.\n\nBut the province says vehicles with Tesla's current level of automation aren't part of the autonomous vehicle pilot program and are governed by rules currently in place.\n\nSo what happens if there is an accident involving a vehicle being operated with Tesla's level of automation? There have been some close calls, after all.\n\n\"Really, the only agreement is that things will be worked out in the courts,\" said Mike Fitzgerald, an insurance industry analyst with Celent.\n\n\"A car that's in [Tesla's level of automation] is going towards an object in the road and it either can decide to hit that object or swerve into oncoming traffic. If it has control at that time, kind of what everybody's thinking is, it's the auto manufacturer that's going to be liable for that.\"\n\nFitzgerald said that just this month, Volvo stated it would assume all liability in an accident that is proven to be the fault of a Volvo vehicle.\n\n\"So it's a really key development when everyone has been wondering about \u2026 what position they're going to take. So kind of the gauntlet is down. We haven't heard any other manufacturers come out yet, but Volvo is clearly leading the way.\"\n\nUltimately, Fitzgerald said, automation will lead to a significant reduction in accidents, which will also lead to a corresponding reduction in driver insurance premiums.\n\nBut in the interim, he said, the technology is moving faster than regulators can respond.\n\n\"I know that there are already some working groups in Canada and one province [Ontario] that's looking at this.\" Fitzgerald said.\n\n\"There's an awful lot of co-operation and dialogue [required] on a level we haven't seen before and at a speed we haven't seen before.\"",

    "text": "Margaret Atwood has long been a wry, incisive prophet. From \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d to her \u201cOryx and Crake\u201d trilogy, she\u2019s exposed our current ills by peering down the path and discerning perils fast approaching.\n\nIn that time-traveling mode, I\u2019ve just returned from next Tuesday and can report that her upcoming novel is a silly mess.\n\nSeveral chapters of \u201cThe Heart Goes Last\u201d appeared a few years ago in serial form on Byliner under the title \u201cPositron.\u201d At the time, Atwood told NPR that she was inspired by the serial productions of 19th-century novelists such as Charles Dickens. \u201cThe closest analogy is probably TV sitcoms,\u201d she said.\n\nThere\u2019s some truth in advertising there, which should have tempered readers\u2019 expectations, but \u201cThe Heart Goes Last\u201d was highlighted as one of the fall\u2019s most anticipated books. Updated with that plaintive title, an ominous cover image and the publisher\u2019s absurd puffery about its brilliance, this novel seems genetically engineered to trick buyers into taking it seriously.\n\nIt certainly starts seriously enough. The scene opens on a city strafed by unemployment and crime, as though the Great Recession of 2007 had screwed ever downward until the structure of civil society snapped: \u201cThe whole card castle, the whole system fell to pieces,\u201d Atwood writes, \u201ctrillions of dollars wiped off the balance sheets like fog off a window.\u201d Our heroes, Charmaine and Stan, are a once-middle-class couple now reduced to living in an old Honda somewhere in the ruined Northeast. Stan soldiers on, Dumpster-diving and moving the car every few hours to stay ahead of the gangs. His wife buoys herself by recalling the vacuous aphorisms of her Grandma Win.\n\n[Michael Dirda\u2019s review of \u201cMaddAddam,\u201d by Margaret Atwood]\n\nThese opening scenes offer a sharp portrait of the financial rot that destroyed so many North American cities and almost permanently destabilized the economy. We know that many frightened and idle people turn with varying degrees of readiness to violence or despair, but what Atwood shows with such caustic wit is the way economic stress renders once-absurd solutions suddenly plausible. Given a surplus of criminals and a paucity of jobs, why not get government out of the way and let corporate America cure both problems at once?\n\n\u201cTired of living in your car?\u201d an understanding man asks on TV. \u201cRemember what your life used to be like? Before the dependable world we used to know was disrupted? At the Positron Project in the town of Consilience, it can be like that again. We offer not only full employment but also protection from the dangerous elements that afflict so many at this time. Work with like-minded others! Help solve the nation\u2019s problems of joblessness and crime while solving your own! Accentuate the positive!\u201d\n\nThat pitch, infused with racist code words and the stale elixir of market magic, could have been lifted from any number of presidential campaign speeches. But Atwood has arrived at something even more sinister by following the trendlines of our contemporary madness for locking people up in for-profit prisons.\n\nThe name Consilience is derived from \u201cCons + Resilience,\u201d and the inmates \u2014 nay, residents \u2014 are admonished to \u201cdo time now, buy time for our future!\u201d As Stan and Charmaine learn, eager volunteers who enter (and can never leave) this walled town are divided into two rotating groups: For one month, half the population lives in lovely suburban homes. Then everybody switches, and those suburbanites spend the next month in prison. \u201cThink of the savings, with every dwelling serving two sets of residents!\u201d the chief executive crows. It\u2019s \u201ctime-share taken to its logical conclusion\u201d \u2014 something like North Korea run by the Disney corporation.\n\nAs a satire of unregulated markets, this is rich, and the early scenes race by, equally grim and funny. \u201cThere were so many advantages,\u201d Atwood writes in the voice of her corporate huckster. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t rather eat well three times a day, and have a shower with more than a cupful of water, and wear clean clothes and sleep in a comfortable bed devoid of bed bugs? Not to mention the inspiring sense of a shared purpose [and] the assurance that you were contributing to the general good, and a toilet that flushed.\u201d\n\nThings fall apart, naturally. A long line of dystopian satires has programmed us to expect every brave new world to flash its soylent green side sooner or later. And as usual, it\u2019s people! Unfettered by law or conscience, the greedy executives of Consilience devise ever more grotesque ways to extract profit from their alternating prisoners and suburbanites.\n\nBut what\u2019s more surprising than the corruption of Consilience is the quick collapse of this potentially insightful novel about unbridled capitalism. Maybe the fractured process of composition is to blame for the jarring unevenness of \u201cThe Heart Goes Last.\u201d But whatever the cause, just as Atwood begins exploring the horror of living in an incorporated terrarium, the story deflates into a flaccid sex comedy. Even when chickens are involved \u2014 no, especially when chickens are involved \u2014 this is pretty unbearable stuff. The plot rambles, the sharp edge of Atwood\u2019s satire dulls, and we\u2019re left with campy characters gyrating away chapter after chapter. Then some of them dress up like Elvis, in gay and straight varieties. And then it gets weird . . . and there are robot prostitutes and unspeakable accidents during the testing of those robots. And Charmaine may be involved in a for-profit euthanasia scheme that begins to seem preferable to finishing this novel.\n\nHaving abandoned any intelligible pursuit of its dark themes early on, the story limps to a tidy and thoroughly false resolution.\n\nSome disasters can\u2019t be avoided. This one can be.\n\nRon Charles is the editor of Book World. You can follow him on Twitter @RonCharles.\n\nNan A.
